1,91746823,02/27/2010,5.0,"The premise of the book is simple... eat when you're hungry and don't eat when you're not hungry. It was almost too simple to be true. When I started doing this I realized the countless amount of times throughout the day that I ate just for eating sake... not because I was hungry. I would also eat way past the point of being hungry - not good. I've noticed a difference in my weight now and am much more calmer about food because of this book.So, if I've told you all this why read the book? We've eaten the way we've eaten for so long that we've forgotten the skill of listening to our body's hunger cues and fullness cues. Paul McKenna will teach you the tips of how to re-learn these skills. A CD accompanies the book as well.  This is one of only 3 self-help books that I've read that actually made a difference in my life (what are the other two?

2,49426352,03/16/2009,5.0,"Wow, this is amazing! McKenna has four simple rules for weight loss (things like stop eating when you're full). Very easy to follow, and the quick book reinforces the rules. The book includes a hypnosis CD that is 25 minutes long. Listen to it for 2 weeks (I listened at night before bed), and his concepts are reinforced. Now I eat what I want (I can have birthday cake at a party), and just focus on stopping when I'm full. I'm amazed at how much less food I eat and am still full! I'm also in a lot better mood than I have been with other diets. McKenna does talk a lot about a positive self image, and I feel more confident (I know, that sounds cheesy!).

I shared this book with a friend and she has noticed she also snacks less and she has lost 4 lbs in about 2 weeks. Maybe it really can work. You really have to make a conscious effort to think about food differently and not just eat without thinking.Can it really be this simple? This was a quick read with some pretty simple solutions to those of us trying to make the best of our New Years resolutions to lose weight and be healthy. I am excited to put it to the test and will update this review if there are any results (or lack thereof). Read this out loud to my husband while on a road trip and he is up for the challenge also.

5,358489732,06/30/2012,4.0,"At time of writing I am on day 6 of 90 on this weight-loss journey. I will update this review following that to tell you how well it worked. Bear with me if that's what you want to know!For me, this is a brilliant weight-loss system. The criticisms I've seen so far seem to be from people who didn't follow all the steps correctly or give themselves enough time to work with it. This is not a quick fix diet, something you can do for a week then go back to ""eating normally"", it's for people who need to change how they eat for good. Possibly they didn't have 'the right kind' of weight problem (I will explain what I mean about that in a bit!) I don't see how anyone can fail to lose weight if they genuinely follow all the steps - there are only 4! Other criticisms I've seen are about the book being expensive, nothing new and 'just like any other diet book'. I agree that it could be cheaper (which is why I bought mine on ebay!) The version I have is the colour one from 2010 with the CD and DVD. As many of said, the CD and DVD are only the first part of fuller sets which is deemed ""a rip off"" and ""a con"" by some, but you don't need to buy the others - it's not essential, and you can also buy them on ebay - I got the CD set for Â£3! You can easily get along just with the first CD. The DVD is just a summary of the main points of the book for people who can't be bothered to read it - not essential. You should listen to the CD every day as part of the plan. Some people have struggled with this as his voice sounds quite funny and it can be distracting, but personally I use hypnosis CDs quite a bit when going to sleep so it was fine (although I missed Glenn Harrold!) This version of the book does have a lot of padding - large pretty pictures, large typefaces, pages with no text at all, and there is some repetition in the text as well. In that way, it could be smaller and less glossy and therefore cheaper. The second half of the book is a diet journal you are meant to fill in daily for 90 days. Some people find this ""a con"" as well. It's a very basic journal that involves minimal writing (you just tick things off a list), but it has little exercises each day designed to help you think about things and love yourself and all sorts of things. I like that part because it feels like I'm getting some therapy for my money. I believe in therapeutic journaling, so I think this is a good part of the book, and I'd say keep another journal where you can actually write more! It is like other diet books in that they all tend to state that they aren't diet books and diets don't work. I haven't really read a lot of diet books because I do believe that they are generally a bad thing, but it seems to me that I do agree with everything PM says in here - low-fat, sugar-free 'diet' foods are the devil's work (my words, not Paul's!) and diets make people fatter. They haven't made me fatter, because I don't tend to diet, but nevertheless, I am fat because I eat too much. Or rather, I have been eating too much - I'm not now! This is where I come to being ""the wrong kind of weight problem"" for this book...I think there are two kinds of fat people - people who have always been fat and people who have got fat in later life. They may look the same but they behave differently. If you have got fat because you gave birth a few times, or went out drinking a lot in your twenties, developed bad habits at university, didn't have tme to eat well looking after kids etc. you will feel differently about your fatness than someone who grew up chubby and got teased, overate for comfort after being bullied, learned how to they could best 'blend in' with the people of normal size growing up, used their fatness as armour, ate in secret, learning to move our bulk through an average-sized world without causing too much offence...that makes a different kind of fat person. Any kind of fat person can use this system, whether they have 1 stone or 400 stones to lose. Paul uses examples from many different situations. But I think the 'lifelong fatties' would probably benefit from it more because of all the work on self-esteem and body-image. If you do this properly, it is a life change and a long, slow & steady journey and that's how long it takes to make your brain adjust to being normal after a lifetime of thinking it's not. It works with the inner problems causing you to overeat, and not just on the rules of what to eat - there are no rules of what to eat!There are also NLP techniques to deal with food cravings - not sure what I think about those because I've not tried them and haven't needed to yet. I will if I have a strong craving. Maybe it's one of those things that work if you believe it will.I would say, buy it second-hand, follow all the steps including the CD (remember that Paul McKenna is a famous hypnotist and not a dietician, so that will be a key part of this!), give it some time and TRUST that it will work, DON'T keep weighing yourself, take or leave the DVD and NLP, keep a journal, move around more, drink water, play motivational music, eat slowly and listen to your body. The worst thing that will happen is you won't lose any weight at all, but I'd like to see you try.",6,0.9735,0.065,0.848,0.087,0.5117415653129939,NEGATIVE,0.9023
6,42510797,01/09/2009,5.0,Wow! I watched his television series and was very impressed. Picked up the book on an impulse at B&N. It comes with a CD that is a self-hypnosis CD. I LOVE IT!!!

8,389884293,08/12/2012,4.0,"Well this is totally unexpected, but... this guy really knows what he's doing! The problem for some people might be that he doesn't get into explaining how all of this stuff works to change your brain into functioning like a thin person's brain. I think he purposely tried to keep this very simple. So for someone like me who's not convinced about such things until she understands how they work, this book could easily be blown off as self-help hogwash. But since he takes ideas from things I've been learning about for a bit, I can see the genius behind it. I'm just not sure your average reader is going to blindly trust this method enough to really keep up with it (even though there's really not that much to keep up with). When I picked up this book (for $1), I thought, ""Yeah well sure... hypnosis is great, but EFT will REALLY get your brain on the right track."" Well guess what... he teaches EFT in the book! And a variation of the HAMR technique (see this blog about how one person recovered from MCS by using limbic retraining, EFT and HAMR), as well as NLP and some other brain-retraining techniques that I've been using from the Gupta Programme. So if any of the folks using Gupta or DNRS brain retraining would like to tackle some issues around eating, this is a good place to start. And I have to say, after a week of reading this and listening to the CD twice a day, I can't say that I'm really putting forth an effort to slim down, but I do find that I'm just less interested in eating things or amounts that I really ""shouldn't"" be eating. (Although he would say there's no food you ""shouldn't"" eat, I kinda think that's just a little bit of bait-and-switch on his part. You're not supposed to think that you're denying yourself your ""favorites,"" but I think you might wind up changing your mind about how appealing your favorites really are.) Of course the additional reading that I do about what different foods/chems do to your health, or how they're slaughtered/produced, also helps me to train my brain away from craving certain things.Of course, I obviously don't completely agree with someone who says, ""Eat whatever you want."" But hey... if the simple nature of this program is what it takes for it to work for people, then so be it.ALL THAT SAID, I don't expect any magical results from this, mainly because I have trouble with two of the four rules: Eat when you're hungry, and stop eating when you think you're full. I'm one of those people he talks about who used to starve themselves and so has trained themselves to not know what hunger feels like. In addition, my MCS-related digestive pains are something I can't usually differentiate from hunger sensations. So what I'm saying is... I don't know how to tell when I'm hungry or when I'm full (until either is at an extreme, and then it becomes obvious; and then there are times when I feel both extremes simultaneously... so you can see this gets confusing for me). I've also learned, from years of having ulcers, a reflex of feeding myself to get rid of any ""sick"" feelings. So you can imagine that I really started putting on the pounds when I became chronically ill. This isn't directly addressed in the book, but I can extrapolate a plan for breaking that reflex with EFT and/or HAMR (we'll see if I ever actually put forth the effort, though... I've got bigger fish to fry for now). I just would get more out of this if he had a better method for teaching yourself how to learn what hungry feels like.

It's a good idea to make your first response to hunger pangs a fresh glass of water. If you're not hungry afterward, it was thirst; if you still are, dig in!2. As soon as you've had enought to eat, you'll notice that each subsequent bit of food becomes a little less enjoyable than the one before.

We overeat because we're trying to feel better with respect to our emotional hunger, and food can never solve that. If you just eat what your body wants, you won't be overweight. Therefore, he has four rules in his system:1. Eat when you're (physically) hungryâand only when you're (physically) hungry.2. Eat what you actually want (not what you think you should eat).3. Consciously savor every bite.4. Stop eating when you're not hungry any more.There are no forbidden foods or deprivations on this plan. You can eat whatever you want whenever you want, as long as you're actually hungry, you pay attention to every bite, and you stop when you're not hungry any more. (No more clean plate club!) According to the author, all the restrictions are actually what sets up the vicious cycle of slower metabolism, falling off the wagon, and weight gain in the first place. That does make sense to me.Most of what he says matches my experiences, so I think he's right. The way I lost 40 pounds before was by letting go of my desire to protect myself with fat and by consciously refusing to address feeling less than happy with food anymore. (Such a revelation when I realized that was what I was doing!) That totally worked until a few months ago, when I started a mad fiesta of celebratory eating. Hm, turns out eating because things are going well is no better than eating because things suck. Who knew? Haha.Anyway, I'm intrigued by the idea of eating anything you want. That seems like it could cause problems. (I tend to want peanut butter and linguine Alfredo. Not together. Just, those are two things I'd eat the shit out of if I wasn't trying to weigh less.) But it seems worth a try. Being able to eat everything sounds really good. I'm tired of going cold turkey on sugar and then falling off the wagon and regaining a bunch of fat. It would be nice to be able to eat treats sometimes and just have it not be a big deal. That seems like the healthiest approach.I haven't listened to the hypnosis CD yet, but I've found his other ones really helpful. I wish I could reprogram all the garbage in my brain, really.This could be a life-changer; we'll see. I expect the first week or two to be kind of rocky as a sudden free-for-all of eating anything, but hopefully after the ""forbidden fruit"" thing stops being a thing, this will work pretty smoothly. If it really does work like he says, that will be amazing. Who doesn't want to be the right weight and still get to eat everything you like?

But, having used hypnotherapy when I was pregnant, I know that it can work. Mainly, I got this for the book, because, well, I like books.I read the book slowly, as I wanted to take in as much as possible, and I listened to the audio/hypnotherapy when I had a spare half hour. I found that by listening regularly, it helped me keep in mind the positive reasons why I'd like to lose weight and encouraged self belief that I could make it happen. Much of the book is common sense, and it dovetails nicely with other books I've been reading concurrently, but having the audio is worth the price of the book itself. I haven't lost much weight using it; it certainly isn't a cure-all - but the repetition of eating slowly and mindfully does help you develop good eating habits, and this book is much more about a lifestyle change, rather than weightloss (imo, despite the title of the book).So, would I recommend it? Actually, yes.

85,2441178227,01/08/2019,4.0,"Reviewed on Lili Lost in a BookI remember a while back I watched a TV show where Paul McKenna showed the viewers how to lose weight without dieting. I remember trying it for a bit and it actually worked! Fast forward to this past summer where I had had enough of my emotional eating and I decided it was time for me to lose weight. One thing about me: Iâve never been comfortable in my own body, and I SO want to be! Itâs not just about being thin (title of the book couldâve been better, tbh), I want to feel better too! Anyway, I wanted to try out this system again but for the life of me I could not remember what it was! After many days and A LOT of googling I finally found this, the very thing I was looking for (except I didnât realize it was a book too. Lol). So I read through the book (it was a very quick read!) and I even found the TV show on YouTube so watched those 4 segments too, and I put the system to use. After 6 months I lost 20 lbs just doing this!But hereâs the thing, you have to commit to this fully and put the work in. And itâs hard work! Itâs a very simple system, but you really have to stick with it. Paul McKenna actually mentions that at one point you will forget to follow his instructions and will probably break one or multiple of his golden rules. And yes, this happened to me. A lot. And I love that he doesnât shame you for it. Itâs just gonna happen. For me, over the summer at work we went to a preschool (Iâm a home care nurse and I take care of a toddler with a tracheostomy and have to got to school with her to watch her airway) where they had set times for breakfast and lunch and all that, and this is NOT a thing you want when following this system. I did fall off of the wagon for the summer because of it, but I came back on when we were done going there. Hereâs the takeaway: He said it was gonna happen, and it did. I felt bad, but I also didnât dwell on it and give up on it. Just get back on and start over!And I donât know if itâs just me, but I do feel better after starting this! I feel happier and I have more energy! I do wish Iâd lost more weight than I actually have, but I donât fixate on that because Iâm just happy Iâve lost weight at all... without dieting, no less! Guess who just had chicken nuggets and caramel popcorn and enjoyed them? This girl! Lol.I also have started working out... but sticking to a set workout routine has proven to be difficult. I am currently trying the HIIT workouts and that seems to be working the best!So, would I recommend this book to someone trying to lose weight? Yes! The golden rules are very simple, but it is hard work. Trust me, though, it is worth it! And the golden rules sound hard to believe, but it really works!1. When you are hungry, EAT2. EAT WHAT YOU WANT, not what you think you should3. Eat CONSCIOUSLY and enjoy every mouthful4. When you think you are full, STOP eatingThatâs it.

He calls it a mind altering device, lets call it what it is, it's hypnosis and so far for me it's really helped. One of my biggest issues is that I have to clear the plate, no matter how full I feel I have to keep cramming food in until that plate is clear. Not any more :) I can honestly say that this book & CD have helped me to stop eating when I am full.

I'd like the CD to have been more a straight forward spoken reminder of the salient points. But it's a step in a direction which is far healthier and more sensible than dieting.
