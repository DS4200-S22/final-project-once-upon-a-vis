I love how Larsson has no issues writing very misogynistic characters without coming off as misogynistic himself. Some authors should take note.With that said, while I understand that Salander is a morally grey character, I don't understand why the author felt the need for her to have sex with a 16yo when she's 25...",370,0.8775,0.076,0.756,0.167,0.39,POSITIVE,0.9987

‚ÄúSalander was the woman who hated men who hate women.‚Äù

Lisbeth Salander will always be my hero and that‚Äôs that.I took a pretty long pause between 
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
 and this and I thought it would take me longer to get into the story but boy, this second book of the Millennium series was on fire.This is not a light read and it is definitely uncomfortable and sick, with some content warning attached to it, but after you get through the first book, you kind of expect this to happen here too and even on a larger and more hideous scale.And this is, in fact, exactly what you get from 
The Girl Who Played with Fire.
You could actually say that it is‚Ä¶explosive. (Read the book and then come back here and laugh at my pun please.) 

The title of the book really makes sense, but only after you collect your jaw off the floor for the second or third time. I have to say that I was wondering how exactly was that going to be related to the action. Well, because I was busy thinking about everything else, I ignored facts that might have been obvious from the beginning and got sucker-punched because it came like a revelation over me.There is a certain vibration of this book. It is the same kind of humming and buzzing you get after you shake the hell out of a soda can. And when you open it, well, good luck to you. This book was that soda can all right.Human trafficking is the main theme here and it is presented as an issue that must be eradicated. Young girls from poor countries are tricked into believing that they will have a better future for them or for their families. They become nothing more than dependent on the monster that took over their lives using pretty words and sweet promises at first.The book calls out this issue. And the characters fought with a cause against it.

‚ÄúThere are no innocents. There are, however, different degrees of responsibility.‚Äù

By the end of this, everything goes to hell and back, almost literally. One or two times I thought I won‚Äôt be able to keep up with everything anymore. It went shock after shock, gasp after gasp. Maybe I am too easily impressed, but this is exactly how I felt at the end. It almost felt surreal.

The nice touch here though - as nice as it can be - is the amount of revelatory information about one person‚Äôs life, which probably tries to prove a point ‚Äì don‚Äôt judge someone before hearing their story. Our actions are defined by external factors that lashed at our skin back when it was soft and unblemished.As in the first book, the best thing that could ever happen was Lisbeth Salander. If you thought I loved her before, think again, because this bad bitch just stole my heart.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she‚Äôll get a bigger gun.‚Äù

The level of badassery Lisbeth exudes in this book is something beyond almost everything I‚Äôve ever encountered. She is a top-level, Mensa-problem-solving-while-drinking-morning-coffee kind of genius and she is inspiring. She is smart, she is strong, she is fierce and she doesn‚Äôt give two shits about anything.And on top of all that, she‚Äôs a good person who has been through a lot.I am quite sure now that she‚Äôs some sort of mild goth Wonder Woman ‚Äì possibly even immortal.She‚Äôs just phenomenal and if I don‚Äôt sound like I am in love with her already, spoiler alert, I am. She‚Äôs one hell of a character.

I didn‚Äôt think I would like this as much as I liked the first book, but I actually did because I felt a certain kind of development in the story and plot and character development, even though both books are structured to have complex plotlines and plot twists and real characters.It was definitely brutal. The reality is presented as raw and rough as it gets, and the main theme of it is not on the pleasant side. It is dirty and dark and twisted, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt there and true.I do think that this book was more of a warning sign turned into a masterpiece and I can say a thank you to Mr Larrson for thinking of that and leaving it to us. But it is definitely a read for everyone who wants to have a feel of the ugly underworld._________________________________Also:1)

2,76156628,10/29/2009,1.0,"The first book was for the most part plot-driven. The 40-year old mystery took a while to unfold, but was interesting when it did. So was Lisbeth, although she wasn't the main focus. Enter, The Girl Who Played With Fire. The story has now turned character-driven with Lisbeth as the protagonist. But instead of having much of a plot of any character revelations about her early on, we read about her buying a new apartment, grocery shopping, and what furniture she picked out at IKEA in *great* detail. Seriously, you could go down to the store and decorate the same way if you wanted, that's the level of description he gave. I was bored out of my mind. This goes on for a staggering 172 pages.Mystery thriller? Surely you jest! This book wasn't a mystery whatsoever for me. The fact that the police and everyone else working to solve the case chose to ignore it was pitiful.The turning point didn't happen until page 172, which was about 100 pages too late to hold the interest of any reader who's not a masochist. The quick pace and interest it generates rapidly disappears until 375.Really. It was more bloated than a rotting whale.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a better book. I wanted to throw this one against the wall a few times.",247,0.9449,0.059,0.819,0.122,0.4600345560871876,NEGATIVE,1.0
3,253966942,12/31/2011,3.0,"Stieg Larsson doesn't really do subtle. If he thinks an issue is important, he will shout it from the rooftops. With a megaphone. But since he is condemning misogyny and violence towards women, I'm ok with that.
""Salander was the woman who hated men who hate women."" 
This book, much more than its predecessor, focuses on the tiny-but-tough Lisbeth Salander. We learn quite a bit about the fascinating and horrific backstory that led to Salander developing her unique, defensive, prickly personality.
""Don‚Äôt ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she‚Äôll get a bigger gun."" But don't let the focus on Lisbeth fool you - essentially, this book should have been simply titled Men Who Hate Women, Part II (Men Who Hate Women was the original title of the first Swedish book, before it was changed to include a more marketable dragon tattoo) as its main theme remains the same as its predecessor's, repeated and restated countless times. And that's why I liked this otherwise far from perfect book.Yet again, Larsson determinedly exposes the unlikable aspects of society - misogyny and adherence to judgmental standards and gender norms that are ever-present even in the European paradise of Sweden. The surface mystery is just that - a plot device, an excuse to get a new angle on Larsson's favorite topic. We see the various shades and sides of hatred towards women, especially if they try to get out of the bounds that society neatly places for them. This is reflected first and foremost in the awful treatment that Salander receives, but also in the treatment of Lisbeth's mother, Sonia Bodig, and the helpless and easily ignored by the society victims of sex trafficking. 
""When all the media assertions were put together, the police appeared to be hunting for a psychotic lesbian who had joined a cult of Satanists that propagandized for S&M sex and hated society in general and men in particular.""
I loved the no-compromise and no-subtlety message that this book delivers on the subjects that are indeed not subtle and should not be compromised on. However, I could not help but sigh and eyeroll at Larsson's less-than-perfect prose. His books could have really benefited from the generous use of editor's red pen. (But I do understand that these books were published posthumously and therefore probably not much was cut out out of respect to the dead author.) My gripes are similar to those of many other readers - the tediousness of every minute detail, the never-ending parade of brand names reading like an ad at times, and what feels like the entire Ikea catalog making a special appearance. This diary-like filler could have been easily cut out, leaving a much shorter and much sharper book. I also giggled at the author's self-insertion and clear wish-fulfillment in the memorable figure of incorruptible and irresistible journalist Blomkvist. And how can I forget a grating pet-peeve of not getting a medical condition right: (view spoiler)[A person who does not feel pain is destined for a rather disabled existence rather than becoming an indestructible superhero. Really. You can Google that (hide spoiler)].The final grade is 3 stars - full marks for the awesome message of the story, but points taken off for far-from-perfect execution.
""His attitude had always been that if a woman clearly indicated that she did not want anything more to do with him, he would go on his way. Not respecting such a message would in his eyes, show a lack of respect for her.""

5,66280449,08/05/2009,4.0,"In the second of his three volume series (well, at least it was three until Larsson's heirs hired someone to make a fourth from his notes) centered on the remarkable researcher and hacker Lisbeth Salandar and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, Larsson has delivered a totally engrossing page-turner. About to publish a book that reveals many dirty secrets concerning the international sex trade in Sweden, Blomkvist is caught up in a deadly race for the truth when his two authors are murdered and Salandar is accused of the crime. Larsson touches on corruption at all levels in this tale of women used and abused, treated like any other imported illegal product and powerless to protest. From low level johns to misogynist cops, from dark psychologists to supersecret intelligence agencies, many layers of Swedish society come under Larsson‚Äôs microscope. It is not a pretty picture.Stieg Larsson - from famourauthors.orgSalandar, back in Sweden after an extended sabbatical, has grown somewhat from the character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but remains hard-core, justifiably paranoid, blessed with almost magical techie powers (maybe a bit too magical), and an impressive command of several forms of combat. She is, as usual, totally victimized and misportrayed by the powers that be, and needs all her savvy to try to right the latest wrongs. Blomkvist is perplexed by Salandar‚Äôs unwillingness to communicate with him, but he has had girl-troubles before. He remains what he was in volume 1, a dedicated, moral actor trying to use his skills to make Sweden a better, or at least more honest, place. Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander - from wikimediaBlomkvist and Salandar are characters one can care about and the subject matter makes for pretty stark, sometimes cartoonish, delineations between good and evil. Maybe a bit more ambiguity would have worked too. But that is a quibble. This is a fun read, a book you will not want to put down, one that leaves you panting for volume 3.My reviews of other Larsson books-----The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium #1)-----The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (Millennium #3)",215,0.885,0.108,0.773,0.119,0.5326984126984127,POSITIVE,0.9996
6,113669444,07/26/2010,4.0,"I am confident that Stieg Larsson has a reason for this, but Lisbeth Salander is not much of a heroine. Let's list her transgressions from The Girl Who Played With Fire (and these will be deliberately out of context):1. She forces herself on a 16 year old boy in Granada.2. She kills a man on the beach during a hurricane.3. She shuts out Blomkvist for a very long time for a perceived slight, giving him no explanation.4. She fails to take or show the necessary care with her ex-guardian after his stroke.5. She alienates everyone else who cares about her.6. She lives off billions that she stole.7. She invades the apartment of her ""guardian"" and threatens his life in the middle of the night.8. She endangers the lives of friends and innocents.9. She very nearly burned her father to death when she was a teenager.10. She pulls a gun on the owner of a car rental agency and shuts him in a broom closet to control him.11. She commits multiple computer violations, including the hacking of government computers.12. She carries and uses illegal weapons.13. She is genuinely ultraviolent.14. She shoots a man in the foot after macing his eyes, and she tasers another in the testicles.15. She steals a motorcycle.16. She chops her father's knee and skull with an axe.17. She is vengeful in a way that makes Edmond Dant√®s look like a sissy.Let's face it, Lisbeth is more than a little bit nasty. And taken a step further, it is safe to say that she is not particularly likable. She is cold, calculating, emotionally irrational, mean, detached, abrasive, unapproachable, unfriendly, selfish, mercenary, vengeful, and more than a few other things most of us would classify as unlikable.Out of context, Lisbeth Salander is the kind of person who most people would be more than happy to see locked up forever. And if all we had to go on were the reports of newspapers and descriptions of trials, we'd all see it as a failure of the ""justice system"" if she went free.Yet we cheer for her in the Millenium Trilogy; we can't seem to help ourselves. And therein lies what Stieg Larsson is trying to tell us with his challenging protagonist -- context is everything.Larsson isn't simply writing a compelling series of thrillers (and I haven't been so locked into a book, as I was with GWPWF, for a very long time). He isn't simply fishing for a film deal. He isn't just sitting down to write a vapid bestseller. I'd even go so far as to say that Stieg Larsson is not a hack. Nowhere near. He is criticizing the very efficacy of what we so proudly call the ""rule of law.""Larsson is suggesting that the ""rule of law"" fails because it has no room for context. It deals in absolutes (unless you're one of the super-rich or super-influential), and it doesn't give a damn whether you perceived a threat before you lit someone on fire; it doesn't care whether the sixteen year old you're having sex with is mature, in love with you and is totally willing; it doesn't care that you stole the car or killed someone to save a life; it doesn't care that you withheld evidence from the police to protect yourself or someone you love; it doesn't care that you hacked into computers for altruistic reasons; it doesn't care that you were bred to ultraviolence through nature and nurture; it doesn't care about you and it doesn't care about context. It just doesn't care, and because it doesn't care Larsson suggests that we should have a healthy disdain for the ""rule of law"" and recognize its terrible shortcomings because it is the structure we have to live with whether we like it or not.Yet with all this, The Girl Who Played With Fire is -- most importantly -- a cracking read. It is fast paced, cinematic in its noirishness, full of suspense, has a genuine twist or two (one of which actually took me by surprise), a cast of characters it is almost impossible not to love and hate (as the mood takes you) -- even thought they are all rather static -- and it ends with a cliff hanger of the first order (I am guessing this is a problem for some readers, but I am a fan of the cliff hanger).What a shame Stieg Larsson passed from us so soon. I could have read his books for the rest of my life. ",151,0.9607,0.138,0.704,0.157,0.5329532490079367,NEGATIVE,0.9989
7,3124884403,02/26/2020,5.0,"2020 review: Unbelievably good! Beyond doubt one of the best sequels that I have ever read. After the heights of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I didn't think it was humanly possible to maintain or surpass the levels reached by that first book, but Larsson does, and does it with aplomb!Looking at a GIF from the film above, reminds me that I will never watch any of the movies. This is, and always be a masterpiece book of neo feminist noir crime/thriller fiction for me.At the start of the book investigative publication Millennium is sniffing out a big story around the sex trade; Lisbeth is overseas; Nils Bjurman is still seething; and lots of people in positions of authority are going to be exposed. One name connects all this, Zala? Who is Zala?Like the first book, it often feels like the narrator is voicing over a documentary, and it works just as well. We get insight into some of this realities' back stories in this, which blew my mind, but also seamlessly connected the two books. The trial by media; the unstoppable antagonists; the murder squad; so much of this was pitch perfect, and then there's the spellbindingly captivating storytelling. And the gift that just keeps on giving? ...One of the greatest characters ever put down on paper... Lisbeth Salander.10 out of 12, back to back Five Star reads for this series.",150,0.9726,0.059,0.797,0.144,0.3738562091503268,POSITIVE,1.0

He had come.He smelled of aftershave.She hated the smell of him.He...observed her for a long time.She hated his silence.Then he spoke to her. He had a dark, clear voice that stressed, pedantically, each word.She hated his voice.He laid the back of a moist hand on her forehead and ran his fingers along her hairline in a gesture that was probably intended to be friendly.She hated his touch.

Lisbeth Salander is simply unforgettable. 

I read the first book in this trilogy the year it was published in English and I remember the book so vividly that even five years later I transitioned into this book as if I‚Äôd just finished reading Dragon last week. Salander is 4‚Äô11‚Äù, but she walks across the literary landscape with such giant strides it is impossible to ignore her. People who have never read the books or seen the movies have a vague idea of who she is. People who have watched the movies or read the books may eventually forget her name decades from now, but they will not forget her persona; her verve; her courage.Now before we start feeling all warm and fuzzy about Salander there are few problems with knowing her. If you cross her she might throw a Molotov cocktail through your window. She is unreliable, unrelenting, and if you own a computer she will know everything about you. She is a hacker extraordinaire and even though she is extremely private, almost maniacal about her own personal information, she has no problem hacking into your personal affairs after all YOU should have been more careful with it. Despite her bristly exterior and her tendency to answer questions with a stare or a monosyllabic response you might find yourself attracted to her. She has a lesbian friend Mimmi who tries to explain Salander‚Äôs relationship with sex. ‚ÄùApart from the fact that you‚Äôre not a dyke. You‚Äôre probably bisexual. But most of all you‚Äôre sexual--you like sex and you don‚Äôt care about what gender, You‚Äôre an entropic chaos factor.‚ÄùENTROPIC CHAOS FACTOR, sounds mathematical and math does play a role in this novel, but my version of what Mimmi meant by that statement is that Salander is a person who will parachute in out of the blue, shag you until your nucleus becomes a comet, and then leave before you‚Äôve had time to light your first coitus joint. 

‚ÄùA root of an equation is a number which substituted into the equation instead of an unknown convertsthe equation into an identity. The root is said to satisfythe equation. Solving an equation implies findingall of its roots. An equation that is always satisfied,no matter the choice of values for its unknowns,is called an identity.‚ÄùSalander solves complex math equations for relaxation purposes. Throughout the novel she is pursuing the answer to Fermat‚Äôs last theorem. Now in the 1990s Andrew Wiles solved the problem using the world‚Äôs most advanced computer programme which sounds like cheating to me. When she does figure out Fermat‚Äôs intention it is the only time I can remember Stieg Larsson recording his literary heroine...giggling. Stieg Larsson is an interesting story. He delivered three novels to his publisher and shortly thereafter died from a heart attack, attributed to walking up seven flights of stairs. This unexpected demise helped launch the books onto the bestseller lists. We are morbid aren‚Äôt we. He was an investigative reporter by trade and there was an inquiry into whether foul play was involved. It seems he was just a 50 year old man that fate placed a situation in front of him, an out of service elevator, that provided the proper strain to his heart to kill him. What endears these novels to me, even more, is that he wrote them in the evenings as an escape from regular life. Now, there are issues with these books, the use of name brands over and over. You will tire of hearing Powerbook, IKEA and Billy‚Äôs Pan Pizza. If Larsson ate as many Billy‚Äôs Pan Pizza as Salander does in the book that might be the doughy rope that squeezed his heart. 

Billy's Pan Pizza is YUMMY!!!Click the link to check out the Billy's Pan Pizza television commercial. It is a hoot.http://youtu.be/LZ9nUvg5yhkDespite any issues I had with the writing, and sometimes it was clunky, the raw power of the writing and a compelling plot made those issues irrelevant. Salander gets along just fine with the majority of the population, but she hates men who hate women. She ran into several of those in the first book and one in particular is seared into my memory, Nils Bjurman. He is the lawyer that has been assigned to her competency case. She was declared incompetent by the courts and assigned Bjurman to take care of her affairs. Salander is a confident person sometimes too confident and in book one she underestimates her ability to control a situation with Bjurman. He turns the tables on her and brutally raped her. With a presence of mind that is beyond most of the rest of us she recorded the rape and even as he is doing the most sadistic things to her she is going over and over in her head where she made the mistake and what she was going to do to him if he allowed her to live. Interesting enough she lets him live, but holds the video over his head like the sword of Damocles. 

Besides the video she does administer her own form of brutal vengeance, but there is a practicality to her decision not to kill him. The courts would simply assign her another mentor that she doesn‚Äôt have control of and of course she would have to weather an investigation into his murder. In this book she makes a similar mistake in her pursuit for the man responsible for inspiring the rage and the violence that swirls around her.

Mikael Blomkvist is back and when his team of writers unearth a white slavery ring he finds himself battling a controversial issue that may impact the highest levels of society. Underage girls are being brought from Russia and forced into prostitution. It would be an easy assumption to make that every member of society would want to eliminate a situation that allows young girls to be exploited against their will. One of the problems is that men in government, in positions of power, enjoy the availability of such young, beautiful girls for their own sexual perversions. Despite the fact that Salander is not talking to Blomkvist, he is baffled as to why, she is drawn into the investigation because of the use of the name of one man... Zalachenko. As she becomes the main focus of the investigation she is forced to go underground, a skill she is particularly adept at, and as the rocket fueled plot comes to a conclusion this reader couldn‚Äôt have put this book down even if the building was burning down around my ears because Salander... always... puts out a fire with gasoline.

11,971087683,06/18/2014,5.0,"A downright masterpiece. The action sequences, the constant tension continually building up to lead to a tremendous ending. Lisbeth freaking Salander, she may actually be one of the best, and most complex characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. Introverted, extremely genial, and dangerous if need be, she's the epitome of the formula to the creation of a super-intriguing character.Like the first book, this was a complete investigation-kind-of-book. But unlike the first one, this has nothing to do with third parties, and everything to do with Lisbeth. It's a more personal book, and it cements the core of this series, which is Lisbeth. There are lots of new information about Lisbeth, and she becomes somewhat less enigmatic as we begin to get a glimpse at the troublesome, dark past. Sex trafficking, Russian hitman, murders. What else does a book need to be freaking thrilling? Salander in this book becomes obsessed with math, she takes it up as a hobby, and up until the last moments when her life is hanging by a thread, she finds the solution to a mathematical problem. Such a peculiar protagonist, I feel constantly intrigued by her and I always have to expect the unexpected from her.Up until half of the book, nothing extraordinary really happens, it's just plot building up but there's lots of Salander, so it's interesting and gripping to read. Then, at about halfway into the book everything changes. A police hunt begins. You'll have to guess who the hunted is. And how the hell they ended up into this mess.Surprisingly, there's less Blomkvist in this than the first book. Although, he's still a prime character to the story, he takes the role of the secondary character rather than the first one, as we saw him in the first book. In the entirety of the book, Blomkvist and Salander hardly ever meet. So, summing everything up, I'll admit that I liked this better than the first because of the more personal storyline the author followed.

Book Review

4 of 5 stars to The Girl Who Played with Fire, the second book in the Millenium thriller series written in 2006 by Stieg Larsson. Although I am very fond of this book, it wasn't quite as good as the first one, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. But it's a very strong follow-up sequel worth reading. It packs an even larger punch as far as violence and drama, as well as brings out the sexual chemistry and tension between Mikhail and Lisbeth. But this book is all about Lisbeth... and in a strange way, I root for her. Despite the crazy that comes with her, she's been through the ringer more than once. And when she gets revenge on those who harmed her in the past, I was a big fan of her tactics... despite what that may say about me. What's great about these books is the intensity they bring to the entire story.

14,283903144,02/25/2012,5.0,"Three people are dead and Lisbeth Salander's finger prints are on the murder weapon. Can Mikael Blomkvist clear her name before the police find her? And what does Lisbeth's situation have to do with an expose of the Swedish sex trade two of the murder victims were working on?I was afraid The Girl Who Played With Fire would suffer from the sophomore jinx. I'm pleased to say it did not.Larsson must have figured out he had a good thing in Lisbeth Salander while working on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo because she's the primary focus of this, the sequel. Actually, it's not all that much like its predecessor. TGWTDT was a mystery and TGWPWF is a faster paced thriller.The structure of the two books is fairly similar: a slow build up to a lightning storm. Honestly, I can't figure out why these books work so well for me. They both begin slow and have a lot of extraneous details I think might have been pruned had Larsson been alive when they were accepted by a publisher, notably the oddly specific minutae of the characters' everyday life and the prominence of brand names. Still, once I started reading them, they kind of took over my life for a few days.The Girl Who Played With Fire is, in a way, an exploration of Lisbeth Salander's past. Where The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo barely scratched the surface, this book did some strip-mining. Since the villains were players in the sex trade, they were not sympathetic and quite vile. The action was even more brutal than in the previous book and there was a lot more of it. Without giving too much away, Lisbeth Salander is so tough there should be an internet meme dedicated to how much of a bad ass she is. ""If Chuck Norris had a sex change and gained 50% more damage-inflicting skills, he would be Lisbeth Salander"" or something to that effect.I felt that the parts of the story about Lisbeth eclipsed the other parts of the story by a wide margin, a good thing in my book. I wasn't that interested in the everyday business of running Millennium or who was falling for Mikael ""The Ladies Man"" Blomkvist anyway.I guess I should bring this review to a thrilling conclusion before I start giving away plot points. I enjoyed The Girl Who Played With Fire even more than I did the previous volume. Five easy stars.",78,-0.7527,0.124,0.759,0.117,0.5075000000000001,NEGATIVE,0.9605

This is some of the best crime fiction that exists, in my opinion, and Lisbeth Salander remains one of my favourite fictional characters of all time. The plot of this novel is clever and the diverse set of characters fascinating. The only reason why this novel is not just as good as the first one, is because it contains some passages that at times seemed dwelling and somewhat repetitive.

To start off with, he misquotes it several times. And the whole idea that Lisbeth is able to solve it on her own in just a few months, with no formal mathematical training, is cheap. If this were the only thing wrong, it wouldn't of course matter very much. But it's more a symptom of the lack of care he is displaying... the whole book has an unfinished feel to it.

18,82698786,12/31/2009,3.0,"Much later. After such insistence on preserving my idea of my father, my memory of our last meeting, this happened a couple of Fridays ago. I opened up some photos taken by my brother and there my father is, dead in his coffin. I must confess to being quite distressed. And I still don't understand why on earth is this something to preserve? I don't get it one little bit.----------------Hooked. Totally, completely, utterly hooked. I read this book yesterday during lunch even though I was with two perfectly nice interesting people. And then today. Today we cremated my father without any ceremony, but first there was what they call a ‚Äòviewing‚Äô. I so didn‚Äôt want to do that and still have absolutely no comprehension whatsoever as to why one would want to look at a dead body. So while the others did their dead body thing I sat in the lounge area with my nose buried in Stieg. And, although, it would not be true in the least to say I didn‚Äôt go next door to look at my dead father because I couldn‚Äôt put the book down, the fact is that people kept coming in to talk to me, like‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know exactly‚Ä¶.but maybe like they thought that this would create some link between me and whatever was happening next door, like maybe they were worried I‚Äôd feel left out and what I wanted to say to them was ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt you see I‚Äôm reading?‚Äô ‚ÄòIf I miss you all, honestly, I‚Äôll drop by next door, I will, really.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt, doubtless you will be relieved to hear. Instead I chatted amiably to whoever wanted to interrupt me. But. I so wanted to say ‚Äògo away‚Äô. And there I find myself having to put my book down for a bit to talk to my aunt, thinking why do I have to do this, my aunt probably doesn‚Äôt even like me. My mother has two sisters, one‚Äôs a nun, and hence she‚Äôs an absolute trooper, but the other one seems a little fragile to me in some way that I can‚Äôt connect to. And I know it is all my dead father‚Äôs fault. I almost went next door to remind him of that. It was like this. We‚Äôd been separated for many years from both sides of my family, but as a grownup I did start seeing just these two sisters again now and then. The first time my aunt Rosemary was with a bunch of nuns including my other aunt. Paul introduced me to them ‚ÄòThis is Cathy, my eldest, she is a divorcee who plays cards for her living.‚Äô All true, if you want to put it like that. My father said it with great relish and satisfaction, I might add. Not with a long mournful face, shaking his head. Not like, what am I doing to do with her? More like he‚Äôd just bought a red car and didn‚Äôt everybody know they go faster? He loved shocking people. But I do think the only person who might have been the least bit shocked is Rosemary. And ever since when I see her, I feel like she looks at me in some slightly dubious way. Like I‚Äôm a riverboat gambler. Or a scarlet woman; that it follows in some way from being a divorcee who gambles that one is a certain colour as well.And the thing about scarlet is that it is one of those colours that is bigger than others. I was wearing a black party dress today with just the tiniest bit of scarlet on it, but it feels like more. It‚Äôs a colour that stands out. In the literal definition of the word I‚Äôve never been a scarlet woman, but I have certainly done things for money in my life that don‚Äôt feel much different. There too, it‚Äôs a bit like the dress. A little bit of scarlet goes a long, long way.There is a most earnest statistical analysis of this book that will come later on the weekend when I‚Äôve finished. It‚Äôs about breasts and punctuation and honestly, it will be a serious, weighty contribution to the understanding and critical analysis of this book. Update. To keep you interested while I'm still preparing my groundbreaking statistical analysis.Oh. Reading Paul‚Äôs comment I‚Äôm thinking okay, I need to put a bit more about this book here. So.I happened to recall, earlier today, a conversation I had twenty years ago when I was living in Sydney. The phone rang and it was an acquaintance, John. A bit of chitchat and he says ‚ÄòRemember you said how much you were into mangoes.‚Äô DidI? I was slightly taken aback. ‚ÄòYeah, yeah. Last time I saw you, you were talking about them.‚Äô I cast my mind back. It was a Victory Dinner after a bridge tournament. We‚Äôd snuck outside and shared a few joints between courses. But what on earth would have made me say that? Was I so wasted? ‚ÄòWell, John, I‚Äôve never been averse to a nice mango‚Ä¶‚Äô. He was really being quite intense about the whole thing, ‚ÄòI wondered if you wanted me to send you some. Send you some mangoes‚Äô. This was really getting a bit silly. For heaven's sake, I lived in Sydney. I merely had to put my hand into the outside air and a mango might fall into it. And suddenly the penny dropped. He wasn‚Äôt talking about mangoes. He was talking about Northern Territory‚Äôs finest. He was asking me if I wanted him to send me some dope. Of course! He just didn‚Äôt want to say, on the telephone. I was with it. ‚ÄòOh, Mangoes‚Ä¶sorry John. You‚Äôre right, I do still love mangoes. Great idea, please do send me some.‚ÄôLater that night I told Michael about the whole exchange. He was in complete agreement, clearly John was sending us dope. We are expert bridge players, after all. Like we can‚Äôt analyse a situation like this. Like it wouldn‚Äôt be obvious in a Stieg Larsson book, what we were really talking about.A week later a box of mangoes turned up. Michael, with the desperate conviction of a drug addict, took the box apart and then each mango, still sure he was right. Me, I figured straight away, we weren‚Äôt in a crime thriller after all. -------------------------------------------------------The last word on this book.Okay. I‚Äôve, um, read the book now, so here goes. A book review. After a bit of an argument early on with somebody who had read this, I decided to keep some stats. But just as I figured this book was all about the new, busty Salander and the story line was going to be dominated by people sucking on silicon, (people, sic; dykes, yawn), she disappears from the story altogether! What a device. What a piece of creative trickery by the Stieg. What a way to skew my statistics.You will find her tits on pages: 15/1627/8758592103-4106-8and then ‚Äì well, she‚Äôs scarcely in the story for the next few hundred pages. So, although I began the story positively indignant that the superhero had a self-esteem problem that could be resolved by a bit of body mutilation, after a while the whole issue vanished along with the rest of her. I simply don‚Äôt understand why Salander would behave in such a tediously average way. I was ready to be really disappointed with this direction (pp. 106-8 is when her friend Wu points out to her that she is hung up about, and obsessed by, her body) but I‚Äôd forgotten it soon enough. In fact I wondered if the Stieg got rid of her just so as he didn‚Äôt have to find anything more to do with these new possessions of hers.Setting aside the whole pretend breasts thing, do I have to say anything else about the book? It‚Äôs fun, un-put-downable, just like the first one. A dissertation it does not require.I was disappointed with the chess, p. 143 which is badly done. Although this doesn‚Äôt matter in a sense, because none of us know enough to care, if you extrapolate from that, you get to the book itself. If you happen to be in the general field of murder mystery conspiracy, journalistic exposes, police-procedurals etc and think this book is badly done, does that mean it‚Äôs badly done? If we all don‚Äôt know and don‚Äôt care, then it isn‚Äôt badly done, is that right? It‚Äôs believable because it‚Äôs believable. This is just a hypothetical, nothing in particular to do with the book itself. I hope somebody understands what I‚Äôm saying here because I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm with the plot‚Ä¶even though it‚Äôs mine. Maybe this is a better way of putting it. If somebody with a modicum of chess knowledge says the chess is badly done we don't care for obvious reasons. But if a crazed killer said to you 'Nup, sorry, that is just so unbelievable the way...This book is just so not like it is.', wouldn't we care then? Yes? No?On the usage of the comma in relationship to ‚Äòand‚Äô, a source of some discussion recently as I'm confused by how often it is used and why.p.270 We have the sentence ‚ÄòBut we do have to stay on top of what the police uncover and worm out of them what they know.‚Äô I had to read that a couple of times before I understood it meant: ‚ÄòBut we do have to stay on top of what the police uncover, and worm out of them what they know.‚Äô I thought it meant that the police were uncovering and worming, though of course that sentence doesn‚Äôt make sense.Then, what about these:p. 231 ‚ÄòThey had heard no sound from the apartment, and nobody had answered the bell. They returned to their car and parked where they could keep watch on the door.‚ÄôWhy? Why a comma before the ‚Äòand‚Äô in the first of these back-to-back sentences? And if so, then why not in the second?------------------------------------------------------------------",61,0.9969,0.089,0.779,0.132,0.4687236068669891,NEGATIVE,0.9994
19,178655874,06/21/2011,4.0,"If loving the Millennium books is wrong, baby, I don't want to be right.In scanning through the other reviews, I have to concur with many of the problems mentioned: superfluous detail (specific IKEA furniture is mentioned several times--as if I know what any of it looks like just because I have the model number provided, sandwiches are made, coffee is brewed, Billy's Pan Pizzas are consumed); there's a real dearth of poetic or stylized language; there's a cast of hundreds (maybe not quite, but it can certainly feel like it); people whose physical injuries should kill them miraculously survive; there's suspense build-up that has all the subtlety of dramatic chipmunk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73s.... And you know what? Don't care. Don't give a shit. Because all I ask of genre literature is that it tell a helluva good story and Larsson, for all of his sins against the church of high literature, can tell a helluva story. Because a book like this relies so much on plot, here's the basic summary without any spoilers: Lisbeth Salander returns to Sweden after months of living abroad on the billions she stole from Wennerstrom; Mikael Blomkvist is now a media celebrity, though he continues to doggedly search for Salander; Millennium plans to publish a book on the Swedish sex trade (and they plan to name names of police officers and politicians who are involved, as well as bring charges against them upon the date of publication); both Salander and the author of the book become obsessed (for very different reasons) with finding a man named Zala; IKEA's 2010 spring catalog is described in detail; Salander is accused of a double murder and has to go into hiding; Blomkvist doggedly attempts to prove an uncooperative Salander innocent. Of course all of these plot threads, as well as many others, are brought together in the end.What makes this novel really work is the character of Lisbeth Salander. In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Salander is established as a bad ass you do not want to tangle with. In the movies, we have become accustomed to our female action characters as being towering Amazons with pouty lips, glamorous wardrobes, and double D's spilling out of Victoria's Secret push-up bras. The irony of strong women in film (and many books) is that they have to be model beautiful and highly sexualized femme fatales that are desired by fanboys everywhere. And in Lisbeth Salander, Larsson has created the antithesis to all of that hyper-feminine-but-I'll-kick-your-ass-and-look-good-doing-it bullshit. Salander is not tall, she is not glamorous, she is not beautiful. She's described by others as looking like a rag doll or a teenage boy. She's the last person you would expect to hand you your ass on a silver platter. But if you cross her, you can expect things in your life to go very wrong very quickly.The other genius thing Larsson has done with Salander in this novel is that she's beginning to evolve. Using her unexpected wealth, Salander has traveled the world and learned more about herself. She's begun to question her previous lifestyle and has realized that she has few true friends--and that it's her fault. Being anti-social and emotionally closed off has always been a defense mechanism for her, but it's beginning to dawn on her that the price she has paid for keeping her guard up may be too high. For the first time in her life, she has the opportunity to live a different life, but she's not quite sure how to go about it. There's an unexpectedly poignant scene in which Blomkvist looks around Salander's mansion-sized apartment and finds that she is only living out of 3 of the 21 rooms. He notes that, despite all of the new furniture, her home is soulless and completely devoid of mementos, photographs, or anything personal; it's as if she's uncertain how to make this a home and the loneliness of her life is evident. Despite this, she certainly hasn't lost her edge and she still lives a life of stringent moral standards, punishing her enemies without mercy and basically ignoring her friends. I also appreciate that Larsson does not set her up as someone who should be emulated (when Blomkvist blames Salander's mental state on her past, Holger Palmgren tells him, ""I hope you understand that there really is something wrong with Lisbeth . . . Her problems go way beyond problems she had at home""). To me, Salander is a tragic figure. Sure she's MENSA-level intelligent, has a photographic memory, the ability to kick ass and take names, but who would want to be her? We also learn much more about her troubled background in this novel, which further explains some components of her behavior. As for the central mystery of the novel, I didn't find it as compelling as that of Tattoo and there's a twist at the ending worthy of a soap opera reveal, but I still enjoyed the ride enough that I've already ordered my copy of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

20,702946709,08/24/2013,3.0,"The Girl Who Played with Fire is the second novel in Stieg Larsson‚Äôs ‚ÄúMillennium Trilogy‚Äù. It is longer and more consistently written than the first. Lisbeth Salander is the central character in a plot about sex-trafficking. Women are being transported from Russia and The Baltics for prostitution and torture; furthermore some highly placed members of the Swedish government, police and business are implicated. There are twist and turns a-plenty, as Salander herself spends much of the novel being hunted down for a double murder which the reader is invited to believe she did not commit.Having a more defined storyline than the first novel certainly draws the reader in, and Stieg Larsson makes his loyalties crystal clear. Women are repeatedly shown to be categorised and disempowered by society, and in the worst cases to be victims. The original title of ‚ÄúThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo‚Äù was ‚ÄúMen Who Hate Women‚Äù, and this is another version of the same idea. Sometimes it seems as if the plot of both novels is devised to be as unpleasant as Larsson can make it, so that there will be no mistaking the message. In the first novel the reader learns aspects of Salander's character naturally as the story progresses. In this one we learn much more about Salander - including a ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù about one family member near the end (which I personally had guessed, and think others will have too.) But Stieg Larsson seems to be hammering points home repeatedly and rather too often. It needs editing.We already know that Salander has a strong ethical code, but is excessively violent. Despite being short and skinny she will always get the better of her opponents. The action scenes in this novel are pure comic-book, with ‚Äúour heroine‚Äù always downing the dumb, slow-witted muscle-bound baddies. And do most of the males have to be quite so twisted and evil? We know too that she is a genius with a photographic memory. And we do not really need to have Fermat‚Äôs last theorem or snippets of mathematical formulae dotted around the novel to convince us how intellectual she is. It is irritating to find that this all fizzles out to nothing at the end of the novel, as Salander just ‚Äúgiggles‚Äù at her interpretation of Fermat‚Äôs jotting in the margin. At least let us in on the act! We get that she is not interested in anything domestic. She lives on apples and ... Billy‚Äôs Pan Pizza! Just as in the first novel I could not believe how many sandwiches Michel Blomkvist made, in this one Larsson seemed to have an obsession with Billy‚Äôs Pan Pizza. We also get that Salander is not interested in her appearance, except to disguise it as circumstances demand. The part where she opts for breast enhancement just does not ring true with this character. It is not followed up on, and just lends a sour note to the otherwise worthy credentials of the novel.And why, in the middle of the novel, was the reader subjected to a long detailed description of Salander buying a flat - and even worse all the furnishings from IKEA. Had Stieg Larsson lived, of course, all this may have been edited out. The novel is certainly over-long with too many characters. We have a group of journalists, two of whom we remember from the first novel (Michel Blomkvist and Erika Berger). But in addition to this we have a group of police detectives, various politicians, doctors and businessmen - many of whom have similar names. It is just too complicated. The translation is pretty good and only in a few places does the vernacular not sound quite right. The novel starts in Grenada, and the Caribbean feel is a welcome contrast to the iciness of the first novel. After only a few chapters though we are back in Sweden again, coping with names of places, streets and people. Burman, Bjorck, Blomkvist, Bohman and Bublanski. Svenssen and Johanssen. Ekstrom, Sandstrom and Hedstrom - sometimes printed with accents over the ‚Äúo‚Äù and sometimes not. These are a few of the (male) characters. Then there are the place names ... Swedish names are always going to be more difficult for a non-Scandinavian to deal with. Cropping a few of the inessential ones would have been a wise move.All in all this is a good yarn which can move at a fast pace. But it really needs quite a bit cut out. I can see the appeal of the anti-hero Lisbeth Salander, but am still surprised at the success of this trilogy, since there is nothing strikingly original or even devious about the stories, and many of the characters are rather one-dimensional.",54,0.9776,0.077,0.812,0.111,0.4731487633813216,NEGATIVE,0.7697

What I especially liked about this book, was all the weird twists and turns.

‚ÄúNot him too.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot him too what?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnother admirer of Fr√∂ken Salander.‚Äù
Why yes, I am too! Lisbeth has earned herself another admirer. Well, not completely but mostly.This was a BR with the Lisbeth Fanatic who promised me a mindfuck but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get that and then the said fanatic disappeared soon after we commenced the journey got busy reading! ;)Happy now? :PThis is a hard book to review without giving anything out and since I myself haven‚Äôt read the last part, I can‚Äôt say what might/might not tie in later into the final book. So I will strictly keep with the blurb and only talk about what I feel about the book. A good while has elapsed since the Vanger affair and life has moved on. Everyone‚Äôs busy doing their own thing. Lisbeth Salander is on a year-long vacation, globe-trotting, to put some distance between the people and events. As if that‚Äôs going to help. She‚Äôs busy doing a little bit of everything. Focusing on her looks, spying on a random guy, sleeping with a minor, solving age old mathematical puzzles and even killing a guy while saving a women. Oh the middle part? That‚Äôs right. She sleeps with a minor and although it is made out to be consensual, it just kinda rubs wrong. Oh well, as long as she‚Äôs having fun.Meanwhile‚Ä¶.Mikael ‚ÄòKalle‚Äô Blomkvist from Millenium has a penchant for doing expose‚Äôs and taking on that which is socially acceptable. After the success of the last one that turned him into a celebrity of sorts, this time, collaborating with a young journalist, he is doing and expose and getting a book published on Sex Trafficking. Intent on taking on some powerful people and jolting the masses to tell them that there is something wrong with the system itself. 
‚ÄúSay hello to Blomkvist and tell him he‚Äôs tempting fate.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe might like that.‚Äù
 When he‚Äôs not working, he can be found sleeping around with almost anyone and you wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised. Creeped out? Sure. Surprised? Nope!Then‚Ä¶.Lis comes back home and then begins the excruciatingly detailed account of her setting up a home for herself and the process of furnishing it. Quite frankly this part should‚Äôve been cut short. She keeps avoiding Blomkvist and all his attempts of getting in touch with her for years. 
‚ÄúShe had cut him out of her life as surgically and decisively as she deleted files from her computer, and without explanation.‚Äù
 All the while Blomkvist keeps trying to get Lis to talk atleast once so as to understand what went wrong and why he has been carved out of her life so abruptly and harshly.All of a sudden‚Ä¶.A young couple is murdered. On the murder weapon are fingerprints of‚Ä¶.of course‚Ä¶.Lisbeth! With her history and psyche profile, she‚Äôs an obvious walking hazard that just went overboard. An open and shut case for the police authorities, as far as they are concerned. All of the media and authorities easily agree and declare Salander the culprit. 
‚ÄúLisbeth, Lisbeth, what the fuck have you got yourself mixed up in?‚Äù
 All that‚Äôs left is to bring her in. Only‚Ä¶no one can find Lis. She seems to have disappeared and won‚Äôt be found unless she wants to. But she can keep tabs on everyone and everything and she does. And ensues the game of cat and mouse and the reveal at the end is bound to leave your jaw on the floor.So‚Ä¶this book is weird as shit! So was the last one. And I think no one will disagree with me. This book is all about Lis. Her character curve is most amazingly shaped. The background on her is very well done, on what turned her into the way she is. And the way she is, kickass she may be but she is as far from regular and normal as you can imagine. The writing is good and fluent. The book is definitely slow to pick up but once it starts rolling, it‚Äôs a great ride. This series is mostly focused on crime and violence against women. For such a book you definitely need a badass, kickass and cocky little devil of a leading lady and who better than Lisbeth Salander! 
‚ÄúSalander was the woman who hated men who hate women.‚Äù
 Although it wouldn‚Äôt be wrong if I said that Lisbeth is fucking nasty. And if I am honest, it is safe to say that she is not very likable. Miss Salander is cold, calculating, mean, hopelessly detached, abrasive, unfriendly, selfish, vengeful, and bordering on psychopath. ‚ÄúBut this dude just said he‚Äôs a fan‚Äù, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre thinking, right?The point is, context matters. Not all seemly deplorable acts are truly deplorable but most are. Not all that Lis does is badass. Some of what she does is just hurtful and chaffing. But the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô of it matters. A person is a certain way because they were molded that way. And it‚Äôs not for us to say whether they came up right or not. We weren‚Äôt there. And yet‚Ä¶we are here now. And there is nothing worse than not taking someone on their merit. Past shapes us up but it is not an indication of future. Someone came close and hurt you and broke your trust; doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else will too. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt say goodbye.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you why: because you don‚Äôt give a shit about other people,‚Äù Armansky said matter-of-factly.Salander bit her lower lip. ‚ÄúUsually it‚Äôs other people who don‚Äôt give a shit about me.‚Äù‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù Armansky said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got an attitude problem and you treat people like dirt when they‚Äôre trying to be your friends. It‚Äôs that simple.‚Äù 
When I was reading the first book and the good people of GR asked me how I felt about Lis, I told them she reminds me a little too much of a real life person I know and that can be a bad thing. But book one was fine and I ended up liking Lis quite a lot. But after reading this book, my fears have been realized. Lis does too many things that I am personally not okay with and thus my love for her has diminished. For me the highlight of this book was the bond between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. Rather how Blomkvist is bonded to Lis. How he treats her with respect and how he affords her his trust. When all the world is against her, he stands in her corner like a rock (even if remotely through a computer) and believes in her against all odds. When everyone has written her off, he didn‚Äôt. 
‚ÄúBlomkvist felt as if someone were squeezing his heart. He felt that he had to find Salander and hold her close. She would probably bite him if he tried.‚Äù
 Someone who believed in her despite her treating him like shit. Something I hate Lis for. Someone who cares for you, makes an effort for you even if it is in their own flawed ways, it should earn them respect and trust, atleast a small measure of it. I could turn this into a debate and a philosophical thing but where‚Äôd be the point in that?On the whole, this book is a good follow up on the first one even though it is a bit of a letdown for me. It makes for a good fast paced read that will keep you biting your nails from time to time. The book ends on a cliffhanger and makes you want to pick the next installment right away. There are some major flaws in this book and its plot, especially the foolhardy approach of Lis at times, who has definitely done some major ass kicking in the book and it is good to learn more about her character and her motivations and yet, it doesn‚Äôt justifying her being bitchy most of the times. But the moral of the story is 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she‚Äôll get a bigger gun.‚Äù

24,102099945,05/10/2010,3.0,"There is ample description of our titular heroine in the first third of ""The Girl Who Played with Fire."" Lisbeth Salander is composing and arranging a new life for herself while still maintaining the baggage left over from her early years (tons of child abuse) and the occurrences of Book #1. And she's still acting, to put it nicely, quite unconventional. It is precisely this mask, as well as people's prejudices & judgements that make her the ideal infiltrator of conspiracies in the highest echelons of modern Swedish society.All the characters from the first make cameos (well, the ones who survived), & it is because of the magnifying glass on ""The Girl (with the Dragon Tattoo)"" & the slow introduction of our old pals that makes this a more enjoyable read. The focus of the book changes radically and Mikael Blomkist, the protagonist of Book 1 is more in the background this time. Lisbeth is totally more interesting than Mikael. & yet, I am not quite certain if it is enough.New ""thrillers"" tend to give you pages and pages you can devour but, really, in perhaps more elegant hands these tales may have touched the Gates of LITERATURE and less trees would have been used. This is a Hollywood flick with symbolism which adds much needed relevance to the genre--& all this is good. Also good--the anti-Macho sentiment and reversal of roles (in this case--the girl with Aperger's is smarter, more agile and even richer than most of the human population) which will be undoubtedly be scrutinized furthermore in the concluding installment.

""We couldn't send a woman to do that military job because what if she got her period? She couldn't take a week off when she's there!"" ""There are just some days in the month when a woman diplomat wouldn't be able to do her job."" ""I wouldn't watch women's sports because women aren't as strong as men, but I guess the clothes are hot."" ""But, if we hire her, she'll probably want more time off because she has a kid, so she won't be able to do her job."" ""Sure one 'woman' did that, but she isn't like real women, and she's probably a lesbian.""It is easy to internalize that thinking, even though it obviously makes very little sense. Plenty of men are short and women are tall. Plenty of women are athletic and men sedentary. Gender has very little to do with physical strength, abilities, or athleticism. And, of course, plenty of men experience indoctrination that they are weak or lazy, and plenty of women, thankfully, live in families that undermine these stereotypes, so I'm not talking in specifics here. What I'm talking about is media and culture and the gendered expectations they impose as a sort of zeitgeist based in gender. That spirit is still that femininity is weak and masculinity is strong, and even where we see it making no sense, it is easier said than done to untangle right from wrong.This second installment of the adventures of Lisbeth Salander looks very academically at appearances in basically the same manner as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo analyzed consent. It has Lisbeth with dark hair and light, tattoos and implants. It sizes her, the smallest of small girls, up against the most giant of giant men. It is also clever, in the same academic way that GWTDT was with consent, in easing the reader into comparisons and becoming more extreme, developing the idea to its furthest, as the book goes on. The boxer takes on the giant; Lisbeth takes on the douchey biker: Larssen eases us into the comparison of sizes and appearances. And the idea is this: appearance and size do not dictate our successes and failures; they should not dictate who we are.I think the idea of Lisbeth getting implants early on in the book is interesting. The feel of the way it plays out with her seems . . . off, but I still can appreciate a sort of contrast between my instinctive reaction to Lisbeth altering her body with tattoos to my reaction to her altering her body with implants. On the one hand, I do think my aversion to the idea of implants is valid because of all of the women I‚Äôve known whose implants have become infected or calcified. It‚Äôs just a bad health decision in most cases, in my opinion, in a way that I don‚Äôt think tattoos are unhealthy as a rule. On the other hand, I can see how altering your own body, in any way, can be experimental and interesting and give a sense of ownership. So, to the extent I start to judge the choice to get implants as succumbing to an oppressive social idea of women‚Äôs bodies, and getting tattoos as valid and empowering, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being entirely fair. I am cool with a woman doing what she wants with her body, and judging a woman based on plastic surgery ultimately seems as dumb to me as judging her based on her tattoos.Still, it seems unlikely to me that a woman who had a bad day would run herself a Jacuzzi bath and sink to the bottom of it, pinching her nipples really hard, even if she had just gotten a boob job she was super excited about. That seemed weird. It also seemed weirdly simplistic to me to describe how pleased Lisbeth was with her implants and how they made her feel attractive. I don‚Äôt dispute the idea that implants could make a woman feel attractive, but that seems like a shallow emotion to describe compared to other, underlying feelings that go along with it. Maybe it is not true for every woman, but when I drastically change my appearance to look more like a magazine and get a lot of positive feedback for it, there is always a feeling of betrayal I have that goes deeper than the flattery. I look more like a doll, and what people want from me is that I be a doll. But, I know that is not who I am or want to be. It also reminds me that people are suckers for media. So, while I don‚Äôt think those are universal feelings, I do think that Lisbeth and I have similar enough outlooks that it throws me off that she would be so single-mindedly pleased with her boobs.Also, I will tell you right now that blond hair is not a good disguise. You go from dark hair to blond and you immediately get a lot more attention. Not that I think people would have identified Lisbeth, because I think they would have just been looking at her hair and boobs, but it is not a good disguise.So, I appreciate the academic comparisons of appearance, but I felt very disengaged with this story and these characters overall. Blomkvist is such a douche. Every time he said something, with his simpering patience, I wanted to punch him. The letter he wrote to Salander. Oh my god. I hate that guy. What a manipulative, selfish martyr. What was with Larsson being totally cool with Salander‚Äôs statutory rape of the island kid? Oh wait, huh, did he say later in the book that the age for statutory rape in Sweden is super young? Nevertheless, why was Salander okay with that? Everything that happened at the beginning of this book was very disorienting. In GWTDT, you could have cut the first 100 pages, but in this, you could have cut the first 200. Not looking forward to the first 300 pages of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.I don‚Äôt hate Salander at all, but I do feel somewhat indifferent about her. At the end of this one, when (view spoiler)[she dies and gets buried, I was like, ‚ÄúHuh, that is a bold move,‚Äù but I felt no emotion about it. And then it is made less bold by her rising again, but whatever (hide spoiler)]. Partly, regardless of what happens to her, I think Lisbeth‚Äôs life is already forfeit to this war she is fighting, so it is difficult to have hopes for her. She isn‚Äôt really a person, with her own dreams, because that isn‚Äôt possible for her - she is a sort of slave to fighting hatred of women. That is important, and I love that about her character, but at the same time, it‚Äôs not very human. It‚Äôs not emotionally complex.Or, maybe it is ambivalence I feel about Lisbeth, not indifference, because in this one, like in GWTDT, there was a moment where she quoted something I recently said. It came about three-fourths of the way through the book, like it did in GWTDT, and it was sort of like a slap in the face. Like watching a robot take on my personality. Weird. I feel connected to Lisbeth through those things that she says, but it still always feels like Larsson was following me around, saw me say something, and wrote it down. And seeing me from the outside didn‚Äôt really tell him what was behind the thing I said. That‚Äôs how I feel about Salander ‚Äì like Larsson couldn‚Äôt crack through her character to tell me what was inside. Those are the things I want to know about a character: the guts and innards. I want an author to take them apart and show me the character‚Äôs beating heart. That is not Larsson‚Äôs skill, so I end up feeling disconnected.It is interesting that so much of this seems so purposeful, but an almost equal amount of it seems like a waste of space. After the first 200 pages, I was with the story, but until then I was doing some serious sighing and eye-rolling. I think it is a good policy to read these books in one sitting, and probably not while you‚Äôre reading The Iliad, which is what I did. The Iliad is like a bowl of rich chocolate mousse, where you can take one bite and be satisfied for days. This book is like what I imagine a Billy‚Äôs Pan Pizza to be: something sort of tasteless to rush through for the satisfaction of feeling full in the end.

She makes the most driven person you know seem like a lazy procrastinator. Blomkvist and Salander are working towards a similar goal, but they never get on the same page. This is because Salander is as alpha and lone wolf as ever before. I think if they worked as close partners it would ruin a lot of the mystery and excitement that's built up from the chaos of both their efforts. Picture Sherlock and Watson working on the same case with little to no contact with each other. It's a stark contrast from the original.

Following the events of the first book, Lisbeth has left Sweden and been traveling abroad for over a year. She‚Äôs angry with Mikeal Blomkvist and has broken off all contact with him, but he has no idea why since Salander is far too socially awkward to ever explain herself or try to mend a damaged relationship. Blomkvist is busy himself since recent events have made him an extremely famous journalist and the magazine he co-owns, Millennium, is still riding high based on his work.As Salander returns to Sweden, she‚Äôs unaware that an old enemy is plotting against her. Meanwhile, Blomkvist and the Millennium staff are preparing to publish a special edition and book based on the work of a free-lance journalist who has collected a damning amount of material on the Swedish sex-slave trade and the government officials and customers who have allowed it to flourish. When Salander gets word of this, she takes a personal interest, but in typical Salander fashion, she does it on her own terms and still won‚Äôt contact Blomkvist. This time, her independent ways backfire and she ends up framed for murder.Misperceptions of her background soon make her tabloid fodder as she‚Äôs on the run and the most wanted person in Sweden. A handful of friends, including Blomkvist, are convinced she‚Äôs innocent and try to help, but Salander is far more concerned with getting revenge than clearing her name.As with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, the main appeal of this book is Salander. Lisbeth would be a huge pain in the ass to know in real life, but she makes for fascinating reading. Her continued refusal to engage an authority figure for any reason, and her pursuit of complete revenge against those she perceives as enemies make Lisbeth a wildly original character. She only has three ways to deal with other people. Mild acceptance of those she tolerates, completely ignoring the vast majority, or the scorched earth policy she uses against her enemies. There‚Äôs no compromise or quitting for Lisbeth, and with personal grudges to settle in this one, she‚Äôs pulling out all the stops.Reading the first two books by Larsson is a kind of enjoyable torture since we know that he only wrote one more before his death in 2004. I sincerely wish he‚Äôd have been able to write a dozen books with Salander and Blomkvist because I already know I‚Äôm going to miss them after the third one is released here in the U.S. Like the first book, this one also has a strong theme of exploring the misogyny and exploitation of women in Swedish government and culture, and that leads to some frank, but not graphic, scenes of rape and abuse.

First off, a quick note on the movie vs. the book: the book is structured differently from the movie, and goes into greater depth about nearly everything (this is sometimes a good thing, and sometimes a very, very bad thing). Entire characters and subplots are omitted, but the bare bones of the story is still intact. So I'd recommened the movie, but with the addition that you should read the book if you want to fully understand everything that goes on. Anyway, on to the book. It's been a while since I've done a review in my ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" style (PATENT PENDING), so here we go. The Good: Lisbeth Salander is still awesome, and always will be. Especially interesting is the transformation she goes through in this book, where she stops dressing like a teenager, removes one of her tattoos and most of her piercings, buys an apartment, shops for furniture, has a somewhat stable relationship...essentially, we get to see Lisbeth becoming a grownup. But rest assured - her awesome is in no way diminished by her newfound domesticity. She still fucks everyone's shit up on a daily basis, and a disinterested sneer is still her expression of choice. Additionally, the story itself is really interesting, not in the least because we get a detailed look at Lisbeth's background and how she became who she is. Blomkvist's detective work is still fascinating to watch, although I was less thrilled to learn the details of the continuing saga entitled Mikael Blomkvist Sleeps With Everyone And It's Totally Normal. (I mean, Jesus, Micke - Harriet Vanger? Dude. DUDE.)The Bad: I don't really know what went on in the editing process for this book, or if there was any. The only explanation I can come up with is that Stieg Larsson's editors, out of respect for the recently-deceased author, decided that it would be a fitting tribute to send his books out exactly as they were in the original drafts. That has to be it, because there's no other excuse for the staggering amount of pointless details we're subjected to in this book. I thought it was bad in the first book. I had no idea. Not only do we have to wade through pages and pages of the bullshit office drama plaguing the Stockholm police department and hear about every damn detail of Blomkvist's sexual exploits, but we also, in true Larsson form, hear about what every character wears every day, what kind of computer they use (always wanted to know how much RAM Lisbeth's computer has? You're in luck!), what brand of car they drive, and what they eat for every. goddamn. meal. When Lisbeth buys her apartment and has to furnish it, she naturally goes to IKEA (that's the only store they have in Sweden, right? Besides 7-Elevens, which are aparently everywhere and a great place for an affluent businessman to have lunch). The description of her shopping trip, where we are given an inventoried list of everything she buys, lasts TWO WHOLE PAGES. *facedesk* You're killing me, Larsson. The Ugly: Stieg Larsson, as far as I can tell, wrote these books mainly as a social statement about misogyny and sexism and how women are abused and mistreated by The System. He's not just aiming to write a series of exciting detective stories, he wants to open his readers' eyes to the very real problems of sexual abuse that women go through every day. For taking on this task, I applaud him. But he might be a total hypocrite. Stick with me, and I'll explain. Early in the book, we spend a (way too long and essentially pointless) few chapters learning about what Lisbeth is doing during her vacation in Grenanda. Basically she spends her time spying on a guy who's beating his wife, sleeping with a sixteen-year-old, and reading about math. ...hang on, what was that middle one? Ah yes. During her vacation, Lisbeth seduces and then starts a relationship with a sixteen-year-old boy. This is not as creepy as it could be (it's completely consensual, there's never any doubt about that), but it's still pretty icky. I don't care that Lisbeth looks like a teenager, she isn't. She's a twenty-four-year old woman having sex with an actual teenager. I don't know, maybe the laws are different is Sweden, but in the United States it doesn't matter how consensual the relationship is, it's still called statutory rape. I think I would have less of a problem with this if Larsson and his characters didn't spend every moment of his books shouting at us, ""Sexually abusing women is the worst crime a person can commit! If you rape someone, Lisbeth Salander will come after you and ruin your life because raping a woman is WRONG."" I agree, but what Larsson is forgetting is that men can be sexually abused, too. What Lisbeth is doing is taking sexual advantage of a minor, and she never even takes a moment to wonder if maybe this is wrong. It simply does not cross her mind that, if she encountered an older man having a relationship with a sixteen-year-old girl, Lisbeth would make him suffer for it with no hesitation. Larsson got so caught up in making a statement about men who hate women that he completely forgot that his herione commits a similar crime. And that's not okay. Final thoughts: this was an interesting book, and I liked learning about Lisbeth's past, but I think I'm done. Thank you for your time, Miss Salander. It's been real.

35,1425927943,10/26/2015,2.0,"The struggle with this book is finally over.After having read ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", I was looking forward to reading this book so much, it actually managed to disappoint me enormously. I needed one week to get through the first book of the series. And one entire month to get through the second.At first, here's 
what I liked
 about it (spoiler-free!):Lisbeth Salander is one of the most amazing characters I've ever met in literature. Scenes with her as a present force were the ones which kept me reading. The character development is brilliantly done, the exploration of her personal background comes very close to being shattering and fascinating at the same time.In addition, the villains are actually allowed to be called characters in their own right. They have motivations, they have fears, they have scruples, they have feelings, and yet they commit the deeds they are called villains for. Stieg Larsson cedes a lot of text to describe the characters' social backgrounds, their working environment and private relationships as well as the relations between each character. All of them are flawed, and - likeable or not - characters whose motivations you can at least retrace, even if not always understand or share.And last, but not least, Stieg Larsson knows how to write a thriller. During the last three chapters, this book was a real page-turner, gripping and compelling alike. But then, why didn't ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" keep up with its predecessor's quality level?The aspects I liked about the novel are simultaneously exactly the 
aspects I disliked
 about it. Lisbeth is the most interesting character out of the entire novel, yet she doesn't even appear for more than 200 pages. The characters themselves are written in an interesting way with all their backgrounds, relationships etc. - yet there are so many, the reader would have needed a glossary to keep them apart from each other. How can I be supposed to distinguish two people called Sonny who both only appear twice or thrice throughout the entire novel? Maybe I do have no good long-term memory, but I just didn't mind twenty newly introduced characters, all working at the police force and investigating the crime case, contributing nothing to the plot and not being close to becoming interesting enough for me to keep up with their scenes. We still had a lot of Mikael and Lisbeth, but Stieg Larsson also included a lot of material surrounding minor characters, material which perhaps made the story feel more realistic, but which also made me feel bored throughout the course of very, very long-winded chapters.I am pleased with the thrilling climax and the cliffhanger, but if it takes 680 out of 760 pages to lead me into the story's core, I just don't care anymore. Two other major issues with this novel included the lack of realistic dialogues and the descriptive writing style which was already present in the first part of the series, but even more so in this one. Do we really have to spend six pages with Lisbeth buying furniture and thinking about how to arrange her new apartment? Apart from that, I had a lot of problems with trying to get into Mikael's head. In contrast to ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", where Mikael was the uncontested protagonist, he appeared like a minor character in this one, and we did nothing but observe him while he was doing his work. Nothing really happened for a long time of the story. Ultimately, I was bored by it.The plot was indisputably well-developed, but the implementation into written words lacked exactly the author's affectionate devotion I monitored while reading the previous novel. For me, this was a huge disappointment, but I will definitely read the third book, ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"", soon, and I can only hope it will be a dignified completion of the series.",29,0.9932,0.058,0.815,0.126,0.5125435906685906,NEGATIVE,0.9983
36,91190440,02/24/2010,4.0,"To follow the style of the original title of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" I think this book should have been named ""A Woman Who Hates Men Who Hate Women."" Too convoluted? Yes, but oh so true to the story!On the surface, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" is about sex trafficking and prostitution in Sweden and high-ranking men who abuse underage girls. But, just like the first novel, it's not quite that simple - the story gradually morphs into a tale of sexual prejudice, abuse of power, and governmental conspiracy. And even more, this book is about Lisbeth Salander, her past, her roots and the events in her life that made her who she is - a violent vigilante who hates men who hate women. It is a great book, much more so in the second half than in the first. We get to know and understand Salander much better, her personal story is painful and at the same time inspiring, her violent crusade against abusers is compelling. However, as much as this book is a page-turner, the flaws can't be overlooked. The novel has a slow start - too many pages are dedicated to exploring everyone's sexual preferences/histories/partners/encounters, ""testing"" of Salander's newly acquired breast implants, etc. This part should have been trimmed down. Do I really need to know that Erika prefers doing IT with two men? Don't think so. The other thing that is even more apparent in this book is that Larsson has a habit of repeating himself, narrating the same events several times by multiple characters. Editing should have taken care of it. And my final qualm, this novel just seems a little incomplete, there are some loose ends left and it definitely lacks an epilogue that would tie the story together.Regardless of the flaws, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" is a worthy sequel and I think fans of the first book will enjoy the second just the same.

Actually, horror visits just about everybody in the book, but that's Larsson for you.Not only do we get a whole new plot, with intricacies galore in this second book, but we see our favorite characters evolve and deepen in complexity. We get new villains and we are revisited by some of the old ones. (Who knew Stockholm, city of majesty, light, and elegance, had such a nether side? Drugs, murder, political corruption, prostitution, rape--Stockholm's got it all.)Because I can't say much about the plot without giving it away, I'll just say that this is a fantastic read, maybe just one smidgeon less engrossing than 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" but still guaranteed to make you stop everything else in life to finish it.",29,-0.9798,0.164,0.747,0.088,0.4610389610389609,POSITIVE,0.9973

That's my prediction.This book gets an extra star for being less dry than the first one (through no fault of Dragon Tattoo's, there was a LOT of setup to do) and for focusing on Lisbeth's backstory, because she is one of the most interesting characters I've ever read. She's realistic and strange and violent and smart and I LOVE HER. No extra star for the ending though, because seriously you DON'T END A BOOK WITH NO CLOSURE JFC.

40,84253109,01/10/2010,1.0,"Hmm. So the quote on the front cover says ""Even more gripping and astonishing than the first...This novel will leave readers on the edge of their seats"". If you replaced ""gripping"" with ""frustrating"" and ""astonishing"" with ""tedious"" and also ""on the edge of their seats"" with ""gnashing their teeth"" I would agree with that endorsement.I read the first in this trilogy during my holidays last year and quite enjoyed it. Perhaps I was under the influence of too many nutella crepes and those revolting throat soothers. I don't remember it being as long-winded as this though. I think its length could have been halved. The blurb on the back (and you may already know I'm suspicious of those who write back-cover blurbs and feel quite strongly there should be some kind of inquiry into their practices) states that our heroine is wanted for murder (!!). Yet the murders in question do not actually occur until about page 190. What were all the previous pages for? Amongst other things, we follow our heroine on her international holiday where she experiences a tropical hurricane and saves a woman from being murdered by her husband. All very nice, but not at all relevant to what then becomes the plot.Also, when the investigation gets going there are THREE (3) separate parties doing the investigations. So we have to put up with THREE (3) separate parties running up against dead ends and feeling as if some breakthrough was just there, out of reach, but they were too tired to see it. (Kill me now).Also also, the author spends a lot of extra words describing in detail how people get from A to B, or what model and colour of computer they use, and all sorts of other unnecessary details. (NB Is this a guy thing?). So you may be getting the impression I'm kind of cranky with this book, which is true. But I finished it because I wanted to find out what happened. Larsson is good at plots, even if slow to deliver. I don't know how people think of plots. A shame that his plots seem to revolve entirely around violent sex crimes though. I worry (yes I do) that the popularity of this series is because of some kind of morbid voyeurism on our part. I persisted with ""The Horse Whisperer"" (my least favourite book of all time) because of the terrible accident at the start. What a ghoul. Maybe that's why I like ye olde English detective fiction - the corpse is generally found in their chair at the club, or possibly in a bathtub. Usually there is no evidence of torture or gaping bloody wounds. Then the detective can say something like ""By Gad!"". ",27,-0.9709,0.12,0.785,0.095,0.6168749999999998,NEGATIVE,0.9998

Since her shunning of Mikael Blomkvist, Lisbeth has been travelling the world on the stolen fortune of the scum bag Wennerstrom and whilst I enjoyed reading about Lisbeth on her lonesome self-exile I felt more at ease with the book as soon as she returns to Sweden.

The story was complex enough to hold my attention and at no point did I consider this book a chore.

53,289900586,03/06/2012,3.0," I have the impression that this series of three books by Stieg Larsson put Scandinavian crime fiction on the world map? Of course I'm probably overstating that by a mile. Like the first one, this was a real page-turner, and I finished it in just a couple nights (fast for me). One problem I did have was that once you realize that nothing really bad is going to happen to any of the important characters, a lot of the suspense goes. (Some will smile at my naivete as testified to by that statement. But when I read books like this, and when I see certain types of movies, I often take to heart something that a boyhood friend of mine once said when I chided him about the pleasure he seemed to take in Shoot-em-up Westerns. ""Of course I fall for everything in the movie ... it's more fun that way!"")I do have to admit that at the end of the book I was fooled about the fate of the heroine, but still she has come to be a bit much of a comic book character: Techie Super Woman.

57,111381837,07/13/2010,1.0,"A Summary Without Spoilers: The book begins with a ""Prologue"" which provides an un-necessary flashback to some SM torture/terror experienced by the 12-year-old Salander.And then it's on to the Real Story.In Part One [Chapters 1 through 3, inclusive:] we find Our Plucky Heroine enjoying a well-deserved Caribbean fling: living on the billions stolen from Swedish taxpayers, lazing in the sun doing Super Advanced Math puzzles, picking up and seducing little native boys, and ""saving"" middle-aged women from the clutches of their husbands. ... Meanwhile, back in Sweden, her ""guardian"" is busily researching her past and plotting his revenge.In Part Two [Chapters 4 through 10, inclusive:], Salamander returns to Stockholm after a year of global trotting. She's a whole new person now. She has new boobs (boobs maketh the woman). She has a Lesbian Lover. She's gotten rid of her wasp tattoo and some of her rings. She's rich and buys a new apartment in the tony section of town. She gives her old apartment to her new Lesbian Lover.As she's settling into her new new life in the up-market section of the IKEA catalogue, her guardian Bjurman is making new unsavory friends. She sees him one day in the company of one of them; an unsavory-looking Blond Giant.Meanwhile, over at ""Millennium"" her old ‚Äòfriends‚Äô are working away on A Big New Scoop. They are planning to publish a Big Expose in the magazine about the on-going Baltic sex trade and Sweden's role in the industry. In addition, they will publish a Big Blockbuster expose book by one of the investigators. It will name names. It will dish the trash. It will walk the walk.In Part Three [Chapters 11 through 20, inclusive:], it all hits the fan. But, unfortunately, no one thinks to turn off the fan.Dag and Mia, the principals involved in the ""Millennium"" investigation into the sex trade, are found dead in their apartment by Michael Blomqvist. The weapon involved belongs to Bjurman and has Salander's prints on it. Bjurman too it seems has been shot with this gun. As a result Our Little Girl is a prime suspect in a triple murder case, and her ""story"" is all over the front pages.Three investigations are triggered by these events. One by the police to find Our Girl, the presumed killer. One by Blomkvist to find the ""real killer"". And, one by Milton Security to keep an eye on developments and provide legal counsel for Our Girl if things go awry.Meanwhile, Miriam Wu, the Lesbian Lover, returns from a trip abroad to find herself at the center of a lot of unwanted attention ... from the police, but also [much worse:] from the sensationalist media.In Part Four [Chapters 21 through 32, inclusive:] the focus returns to Salander herself. We learn a great deal about her not only from the leaked media stories but from her reaction to them. We learn for instance how she earned the nickname ‚ÄúWasp‚Äù by sparring with the celebrity boxer Paolo Roberto. We learn that the media are concentrating on her early years and her late teens and are ignoring an apparent blank spot between the years 12 and 15 when ‚ÄúAll The Evil‚Äù happened. A police report covering those years would explain and exonerate her, or so we‚Äôre led to believe.Meanwhile, Salander does some snooping of her own. She finds that a gang led by the Ranta Brothers have been running amphetamines and girls back and forth across the Baltic from Estonia. Their story sheds some light on the Blond Giant and his accomplice, Ponytail. And on a mysterious background figure called ‚ÄúZala‚Äù.The turning point in the story comes when Miriam Wu (the Lesbian Lover) is abducted by the Blond Giant and Ponytail, but is rescued by Celebrity Boxer.Thereafter the saga moves inexorably but all-too-tediously, to its concluding confrontation between Salander, Zala and the Blond Giant. And of course Blomkvist is bringing up the rear, trying to save her.Personal Appraisal:I'm NOT a fan of this series (or of this kind of pulp mush) but I did find the first volume palatable enough to warrant a second helping! Boy was THAT a mistake!!This book is marred by writing so painfully bad, it's a puke party!! There are huge long chunks that read like you're trapped in an IKEA catalog, buying functional pressboard boxes masquerading as ""furniture"". Also, the author suffers from a very serious case of ""consumerist envy"" -- it's not enough to write ""she bought a coffee machine"", No! We must be bored to death by the consumerist details and the up-market product specifications ... ""she bought a top-of-the-line Bjorkenmaster BrewLine with a built-in cappuchino maker, and an automatic toaster/slicer"" (or whatever) ... It makes for some very tedious reading. And, it's most evident when computers are mentioned. He won't just say ""Curiously, Dag's laptop was missing."" NO! Too easy!! He'll write: ""Curiously, Dag's brand new top-o-the-line iPad with the 24"" plasma screen, the overhead camshaft, and 35gazillion byte hard drive was missing. He noticed this because Dag had chosen the Magenta Model which was all rage with the younger set.""And, of course, there are the endless cliches. And not just the common-or-garden ""hang 'em out to dry"" type either. In fact, some of these ""literary"" cliches are so monstrous they are LITERAL HOWLERS.Salander, for instance, allegedly is a natural-born math wizard. We know this cos the novel beats us over the head with it at every available opportunity. Also, (Big Clue) she plays chess ... and NEVER loses. O.M.G.!!!!!Of course, she's got Aspergers [Backasswards:] Syndrome, which in Pulp Fiction Land, is equivalent to saying: ""she's not just a punk loser, dude; she's an idiot savant man. She's got, like, super powers an' stuff.""My absolutely favorite part however, is when she allegedly figures out Fermat's Last Theorem as she's closing in on the Killers!! ... I kid you not!!Wow!! She's, like, a genius dude! AND ... she looks hot on a bike!!!Writing like this is sooo embarrassing only an adolescent could find it credible!!Quotable Quotes:""There was a difference ... between Catholicism and Judaism.""

58,1438792234,11/10/2015,5.0,"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she‚Äôll get a bigger gun.‚ÄùLISBETH SALANDER IS BACK!This time, she is muddled up in a very complicated muder case where a journalist and his criminologist girlfriend were found dead. The suspicion that she is the suspect exemplifies when her guardian and top lawyer is found dead in his apartment. Now, Salander is wanted for three murders. But, very obviously no one can find her.Unlike the first book, things were very interesting from the very beginning. I could not pt down the book even for a minute, and it was crazy following Salander and Blomkvist's actions. Salander, is still, the genius, but certain emotions has found their way into her system, the most important of which is: she is in love. With Mikael Blomkvist. And after that heart-breaking ending in the first book, she is not giving him another chance.‚ÄúBut she wished she had had the guts to go up to him and say hello. Or possibly break his legs, she wasn't sure which.‚ÄùWithout giving out anything, there is only one thing i want to say about the overall plot. It is mind-blowing. I've been in love with crime since forever, and every crime novel has made me a wanna-be detective. I look into cases, and I go through the evidence provided by the writer, and I make my own conclusions. Some really bad stories were so predictable, hat reading the rest of the book was frustrating. But then there are some which baffles you and give you no idea how to crack that case. And then, there are books like The Girl Who Played With Fire,¬†which gives you full idea, who is the killer, yet turns out to be a mind-blowing book. Stieg Larsson brings out twists and turns and it is quite impossible, not to like it.The book follows three investigations told by various different characters. But only Kalle Bastard Blomkvist finds out everything. Literally, everything. He is still the most charming, wittiest, astounding genius. Which brings me to the ending. Open endings has always been my favorite. But this time, although impressed, I'm disappointed.

61,2532301629,09/16/2018,3.0,"TGWPWF takes place about a year after the first novel in the series and has both the strengths and weaknesses of the first-- one the one hand, a page turning thriller, on the other, some clunky prose and the need for some serious editorial cuts. Salander was basically a mystery woman in the first novel; she has serious hacker skills, an eidetic memory and some hard won fighting skills, despite her being 90 pounds and under 5 feet tall. TGWPWF serves to flesh out Salander and highlight some of the mystery of her origins. The novel starts off with Salander traveling around the world for a year and we spend some time with her in Granada (this section could have been shortened significantly) and than returning to Sweden and buying an apartment-- a seriously nice apartment! Mikael Blomkvist and the folks at the magazine are planing on a special issue on women trafficking along with a new published book on the same topic. So, for the first 200 pages plus, we basically follow Salander to an extended trip to IKEA to furnish her new pad and long sessions where we are introduced to the people working on the new issue/book. Slow...Things pick up pretty quickly, however, when one of the people working on the trafficking issue and his girlfriend are gunned down one day, along with the asshole lawyer who served as Salander's guardian. The only clue the cops have is a gun found at the site with Salander's fingerprints on it and instantly, the chase is on. One of the main strengths of the first volume is the unrelenting and vocal explication of the second standards women face in society and this is ruthlessly hammered home here as well. The cops investigating the crime include one female detective and she is definitely treated as second class by the rest of the cops (and her boss). The facts that trafficking exists and exploits helpless women with almost no legal recourse is also proved out. Even judges, cops and other people of authority are seen to regularly visit the forced prostitutes in the trade and feel no regrets. So, the chase is on for Salander but Mikael Blomkvist does not think she did it, but it is a hard sell. This novel turns into a long police procedural that also highlights some of the seedier elements in Swedish society (drugs, prostitution, etc.). Larsson definitely throws us numerous surprises along the way and the middle to the end really move. Final notes: Salander is a great character and I was pleased to see her developed in much more detail here; the clunky prose and pacing issues was more pronounced here than the first volume; and the issues underlying the story still need constant airing until something changes. Bravo for Larsson in this regard! I just wish he had a better editor (I know these were published after his death, so maybe they did not want to tamper too much with the manuscript?). 3.5 stars! I really liked it, but it had some issues that I cannot ignore while rating. On the to the next!",16,0.9831,0.059,0.833,0.109,0.4532851679910503,POSITIVE,0.9801
62,1347948499,07/28/2015,4.0,"The late Stieg Larsson centered his Millennium Trilogy around cruelty towards women -- and the second of the trilogy, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" is a tightly wound thriller that is almost as good as the first. It lacks some of the raw, wild, dark energy, but it tangles together some razor-sharp social commentary (sex trafficking) with a plot centering on Lisbeth Salander.After the first part, your expectations are high and this book will not disappoint you. It starts from the very part where the first book end. The second book in the trilogy by steig is equally intriguing and keeps your interest till the last page. Also the best thing about his books is it's always unpredictable. There are some shocking elements in the book that did affect me a bit. Just like the first book, this plot too has many little elements that create the whole picture. And once again the author has done an admirable job of keeping his narrative crisp and letting one secret out at a time. Top notch thriller written in a dark and morbid vein...Deeply unsettling exploration of sex trafficking...A breathless, wildly pacy story !But it might be better if you do not one after another as they start to feel too similar.

64,1078281425,10/12/2014,5.0,"  ‚ÄúI believe that everyone has it in them to kill another person. In desperation, or hatred, or at least to defend themselves.‚Äù  It's even better than the first one. I couldn't put it down. We learn so much about Lisbeth's backstory and how tough she really is. I don't mind the intensified, unimportant details. In fact, they helped me get into the story even more. Though, all those mentions of coffee and sandwiches only made me hungry. Truth be told, anything can make me hungry. Lisbeth Salander returns to Sweden after one year of living abroad on the billions she stole from Wennerstrom. She lives in complete nirvana while she studies many shades of math. I don't understand how math works and I must admit I was always kinda dumb with anything that involves numbers: economy, statistics, geometry. But the way Larsson presented it, it certainly looks a bit fun. On the other hand, we have Mikael Blomkvist who's now a celebrity. He tries to track Lisbeth down because she has been ignoring him for two years straight. Millennium plans to publish a book on the Swedish sex trade with many police officers and politicians involved. Both Lisbeth and Dag, the author of the book become obsessed with finding a man named Zala, who turns out to be the bigger fish than we all thought. Larsson continues to expose effects of misogyny, sexism and the power of judgmental standards, prejudices and bigotry. It's devastating to see how even bad journalists can be more toxic for society than bad leaders. For those who got hooked up in the series solely for the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth, I wouldn't recommend the continuation of the trilogy. The writing is deliberate, methodical, overly detailed, but fluent and penetrating. Despite many contradictions, Larsson makes it so easy for us to empathise with Lisbeth and Mikael. He does mistery so well, that I couldn't guess what Zala's actual role was until it was revealed. There aren't many twists, but when they are present, it's remarkable. In Lisbeth, the author has created the antithesis to typical feminine heroine. Lisbeth is short, incommodious in her own skin and she looks like a teenage boy. But if you cross her, you'll get a cruel payback sooner or later. Forgiveness is way to abstract for her. Her tragic childhood is fully explained in this novel, which is why her attitude is a bit more understandable.In this novel,she's finally evolving. Using her wealth, she had travelled the world. She has begun to question her previous lifestyle and realised that she has just a few friends, and even those friendships are platonic. Being antisocial, emotionally closed off and inexplicable has always been a defense mechanism for her, but it's beginning to hold her back and makes her feel lonely. She has a chance to change her life, but she doesn't know how to do it. Her edge is still intact and she has her own moral standards which doesn't necessarily concur with the socially accepted standards. She's still punishing her enemies without mercy and ignores the people who care for her. The difference is that she has finally realised how her behaviour may hurt others she cares about and she's making small attempts to make amends.  ‚ÄúBut she wished she had had the guts to go up to him and say hello. Or possibly break his legs, she wasn't sure which.‚Äù  Yup, there is no middle ground with Lisbeth and that is why she's so remarkable. ‚ÄúSalander was the woman who hated men who hate women.‚Äù  She's unconventional and wrathful, but she still one of a kind tragic heroine. She has been such a fighter ever since she was a child. Yes, she has some psychological issues (probably Asperger syndrome) but she's rational, just like everyone else. Honestly, I think her biggest problem is that she's too egocentric.Mikael's love affairs and all other his other macho-man things are in the background. He shows once more why he's such good investigator and the way he's representing journalism gives me hope that anything is possible. He still has integrity,cheekiness and righteousness. On the other hand, he still doesn't give a rat's ass about his daughter, he's still self-centered and has all qualities of Gary Stu. I don't know why I like him so much. I guess I admire how loyal, brave and persistent he is.  ‚ÄúHis attitude had always been that if a woman clearly indicated that she did not want anything more to do with him, he would go on his way. Not respecting such a message would in his eyes, show a lack of respect for her.‚Äù  I tried so hard not to like him and I failed. I usually don't fall for such ""perfect"" characters, but Mikael certainly has undeniable charm and authority. I love it how Larsson showed us that Mikael and Lisbeth's connection is almost unbreakable despite their fundamental differences. They don't face each other often through the novel, but every little conversation they had was striking. It's interesting how completely dissimilar they are, but how they are almost perfect fit, but not necessarily a romantic fit. i wish though they get together in the end with Mikael ending things completely with Erika. I'm not a prude, nor I mind any variation of sexual relationship, I just think that their relationship lost it's meaning after 20 years when they obviously don't want to be life partners.  ‚ÄúHe felt that he had to find Salander and hold her close. She would probably bite him if he tried.‚Äù  Ugh, he knows her so well, despite of all her attempts to keep the distance. I like it how he fully accepts who she is and has never tried to change her. He also never hesitates to tell her when she's wrong. I understand why she wanted to stay away from him, but I think she was too ruthless. He deserved explanation.I have few complaints. I couldn't care less about Erika and her fantasy of having a thresome with her husband and Mikael. I may be too harsh on her, but comparing to a character like Lisbeth, she really doesn't seem that interesting. Also, why almost every noticeable male protagonist has to be a womanizer? Just because girls love him, it automatically makes him a more likeable character? No.   ‚ÄúThe same source that tipped us off about her and Wu at Kvarnen says that she used to hang out with a bunch of girls there a while back. Some kind of girl band called Evil Fingers."" ""Evil fingers?"" Bublanski repeated. ""Seems to be something occult."" ""Don't tell me Salander is some damned Satanist too,"" Bublanski said. ""The media are going to go nuts."" ""Lesbian Satanists,"" Faste said helpfully. ""Hans, you've got a view of women from the Middle Ages,"" Modig said. ""Even I've heard of Evil Fingers."" ""You have?"" Bublanski said. ""It was a girl rock band in the late nineties. No superstars, but they were pretty famous for a while."" ""So hard-rocking lesbian Satanists,"" Faste said.‚Äù  I hate Faste so much. He's basically everything I hate in human kind.  ‚ÄúApart from the fact that you‚Äôre not really a dyke. You‚Äôre probably bisexual. But most of all you‚Äôre sexual‚Äîyou like sex and you don‚Äôt care about what gender. You‚Äôre an entropic chaos factor.‚Äù  Mimi is one of the few who accepts Lisbeth and likes her for it. I hope I'll see more of her in the last part of the trilogy. I think she's the only person Lisbeth feels comfortable with. (view spoiler)[ I liked Dag and I'm sorry he died. It's so tragic he died only because he's a fantastical journalist. Not even for a one second had I thought that Lisbeth killed him and his fianc√©. Though I was a bit suspicious towards death of her legal guardian.I appreciate how Mikael gave Lisbeth the benefit of a doubt. I love how he never stopped fighting for he innocence even when all evidences were against her. He went against whole police department to protect her, because he above all was her friend, even though she was a crappy one to him. Never in life would I have thought that Zalachenko is Lisbeth's father. Everything makes so much sense now. That was a great twist. The more I find out about Lisbeth, the more I admire her. Now I see why she tried to stay away from any kind of administration.  (hide spoiler)]",15,0.999,0.118,0.697,0.185,0.5390492498369212,POSITIVE,0.958

66,2313779610,03/27/2018,4.0,"This trilogy is so unique. I don't think we'll ever see a trilogy quite like this one, or see a writer with the same style as Larsson. I quite like David Lagercrantz' (the author continuing the original trilogy) description of Larsson's writing-""journalistic authoritativeness""-because that's exactly how he writes! It's very matter of fact and like a report. I won't say that this is my favourite series, because it just isn't, but this series is very special and I think everyone should give it a go.Without spoiling too much as this is book 2, this book still follows our main characters Lisbeth and Mikael, with a greater focus on Lisbeth this time. It centres around an investigation into sex trafficking in Sweden and two murders associated with it. We get to know more about Lisbeth's tragic past and the injustices that she has faced. The plot was very well constructed in this, with all the different plotlines linking together perfectly. My one issue with this was that sometimes I did get confused. It's a very complex plot and it makes logical sense, but it's one that I needed to take my time to process. There's a lot going on and I think some things could have been made clearer-nothing too vital, just minor proceedings where I would have to stop and go back to understand. I did enjoy the discussion around sex trafficking and social responsibility and mental health.I loved the greater focus on Lisbeth as she's such a fantastic character. I loved how she developed in this book and it was great seeing all the people who genuinely care for her. Palmgren is one of my favourites too, so I loved seeing them re-establish a relationship. Even Mikael was less of an idiot in this one, perhaps because of the relative lack of women (except for a brief section that added nothing to the story at the start). I was actually glad to see Erika not getting as much page time, especially with her upcoming betrayal. I don't buy her explanation of why she has the affair with Mikael. Loyalty is loyalty, and she was disloyal before she knew Greger was accepting of an open relationship. Dag and Mia were great characters who I cared for a lot, and I was very supportive of their morality and investigation. In short, this is a good book! I don't feel particularly mindblown but these are valuable works within the crime genre and books that I feel are on the cusp of being described as classics.",15,0.9971,0.071,0.72,0.209,0.5037215320910973,POSITIVE,0.9999

Not all of it because the first part (or two) were extremely slow for me. I'm not sure why the pacing feels so off when it comes to the audiobooks vs the physicals or ebooks.. but it just is. So I'm not going to lie. The narrator put me to sleep during the beginning of this book. That's all I'm going to say because I bored out of my mind.

I just hope that the pace is a LOT better._____________________The Girl Who Played with Fire was a pretty good sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. What was interesting was how Lisbeth, who was the MC in the first book was not the center of attention in this book. Well, not in the way you'd think she would be. No, she played more of a supporting role in this book and I actually really liked that change of pace for her. However, her name and face were in the newspapers because of her ""being"" at three different crimes. Well, there is evidence but that means nothing to me at this point.Now that being said I still do love Lisbeth's character because of how strong and independent she is. She is woman hear her roar! I also really liked how her and Mikael are solving one of his old cold cases throughout the book. Overall, it started off at a slow pace. Then, like all other books tend to do, it picked up rather quickly. It was highly interesting - I honestly couldn't put it down! I loved every second of it and I wish it would turn into a movie!!

Larsson is The Master of Suspense and it is really a challenge to put this book down only for some hours.But the deficiencies I mentioned (accordingly to many other reviewers) are still there. Maybe after more than 1,000 pages I got even more aware of them, so I will wait for some weeks before I attack the third tome (which I will definitively do, probably sooner than I think now).Two main objectives: The good characters (Blomkvist, The Girl, Modig, Palmgren, Berger, Svensson, are purely good. They smile, they consider and reconsider, they worry about others‚Äô fate, they are empathic and unselfish. The evil characters (Zala, The Giant, Bj√∂rck, Sandstr√∂m, Bjurman ) are purely evil beyond reason. They are not even intelligent and have no reasonable motives, they are either drunk or too lazy to do anything else than plan their next pointless crime.

It is even more disturbing if the highlighted thought is particularly banal. (‚ÄúPlease cll me. It‚Äôs important.‚Äù; p. 392).

78,2743595182,03/08/2019,5.0,"After the first book, I couldn‚Äôt wait to get my hands on the second instalment in the Millennium series. It took me a while to get started with this review, there are just so many things covered in the book and I had the horrible luck of losing my notes, but it really cannot be pushed back any longer because I‚Äôm already halfway through the third and final book in the trilogy. My memory abilities sits on the opposite spectrum of Salander‚Äôs, and if I don‚Äôt get to my review now, I won‚Äôt be able to distinguish my feelings as I‚Äôm moving on with the story. The story can be roughly divided into three parts. The first, Salander is motting her mentally handicapped and victimized old self as she fills her bank account with millions, travels around the world while working on esoteric math enigmas, experimenting with sexual partners from both sexes, among others adventures. She‚Äôs really living the dream life of what I imagine I‚Äôd do, if I won the lottery or something. It‚Äôs possibly the coolest thing I could think of.There‚Äôs a similarity to the first novel in that Salander and Blomkvist are living separate lives, and it‚Äôs not for a long while until their paths cross. The second part of the book is galvanized to Blomkvist‚Äôs pov with a shocking double murder. From this point on, Salander‚Äôs perspective is completely dropped off, but the story is so centred around her, that it‚Äôs impossible to take in each event without thinking about what Salander‚Äôs involvement is, why she did what she did, and where was she hiding during all of this. As a reader, you will feel her absence more prominently than her voice.The third part of the book is the action, the final battle that links together all the players in a final showdown. It reveals the foreshadowing in the previous part of the book. The two biggest mysterious are the identity of Zala and the event Salander refers to as ‚Äúall the evil.‚Äù Both has a twist, but All The Evil is too overhyped in my opinion. While dramatic and worthy of imagination, the actuality is too expeditious compared to the advertising. A lot of jaw-dropping events happened in the story, so for it to be worthy of its own name, I was expecting something a bit more‚Ä¶ satanical? Maybe I was misled by the translation. Evil just seemed biblical to me, and with the first book still fresh in my memory, you can‚Äôt blame me for making that connection.It was a great read. Just like the first book, there are many themes condensed in this novel as well, with men who hate women as a repeating element. I learned that from one of the reviewers, that the original title is Men Who Hate Women, and I wholehearted agree that it was a more fitting title. I guess Girl Who Played With Fire is more exotic, more mysterious, and has less of a gender-political undertone that could turn some people away from the great story.

79,4145043078,08/25/2021,3.0,"In the second book in the Millennium Series, Lisbeth Salander is back. The book opens in St. George‚Äôs, Grenada, where Lisbeth becomes involved in a couple‚Äôs domestic dispute and survives a hurricane. She then moves back to Sweden where the bulk of the crime/detective story takes place. Lisbeth is the prime suspect in a multiple murder. Lisbeth‚Äôs former relationship partner, Mikhael Blomkvist, believes in her innocence. Lisbeth, Mikhael, and the police perform separate investigations, with Lisbeth laying low to avoid arrest. I liked it more than expected and if you regularly read this genre, you will probably enjoy it even more than I did. The first half adds dimension to Lisbeth Salander‚Äôs character, and she is an extraordinary character. I would not want to get on her bad side. The narrative is most effective when the spotlight is on Salander. There are, however, several drawbacks. It is slow in developing and feels overly long. It is an ‚Äúover-the-top‚Äù revenge story with supporting characters that border on caricatures. The narrative regularly summarizes where the investigation stands, which gets repetitive. At the end, the plot goes completely off the rails, but should appeal to those who enjoy lots of action.

80,107986283,06/20/2010,4.0,"As was the case with ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" this one takes about 200 or so pages to really get rolling, but once it does, it's a pretty entertaining ride all the way to the end. The big difference is that with the characters of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist firmly established from the first book, we have a quicker entry into the world of ""Fire.""It's been a year since the events of ""Dragon Tattoo"" and in that time, the friendship between Salandar and Blomkvist has eroded. Salandar decides to travel the world with her new-found wealth and continues her obsession with becoming nearly invisible to the world-at-large. Meanwhile, Blomkvist is working with a couple on a book and articles about the sex-trafficking trade in Sweden. The expose could prove to be explosive and damning to many of those discussed in the trade, but what Blomkvist doesn't know is the roads will all lead back to Salandar and an incident that happened to her when she was 12 years old. (The book constantly refers to it before finally revealing what happened in the last third of the story. The foreshadowing is a bit obvious at times and it feels like Laarson is trying to say, ""Pay attention because this will be important later."")Returning from her trip, Salandar hacks into Blomkvist's hard drive and discovers what's going on. She goes to confront the couple writing the articles, to give them a piece of the puzzle. Then the couple is found killed as well as her guardian. Saldandar becomes the prime suspect, but thanks to her efforts early in the book to stay off the grid, she can go to ground without much trouble and elude the authorities. She and Blomkvist also are able to correspond via her hack of his computer and he sets about proving her innocence in the affair, all while uncovering how it all ties back to her.As with ""Dragon,"" I found myself wondering how much of Blomkvist was based on Larsson's life and how he viewed himself. At one point, Saldandar reflects on her various romantic entanglements and sees how she never let anyone get to her, except, of course Blomkvist. And, of course, his status as that middle-aged stud who the women can't resist continues. There's also a section where his lover, Berger, reflects on his skills and how she needs what he provides as well as what her husband provides.Those details aside, the novel works well enough and while we know that Salandar didn't commit either murder, the central mystery of who did and why keeps the book going. The novel does stumble a bit in the middle segment, while Salandar is the prime suspect in that it moves her off-stage for this segment. She's referred to and speculated on, but not seen or heard from. This leads to the story having to double back a bit and repeat some portions once she does enter the story again, much to my frustration. The book is a good one and Salandar is an intriguing character. The moments when the story explores her and what makes her tick are fascinating and the final third as the mystery begins to finally unravel is worth the investment.

In desperation, or hatred, or at least to defend themselves.‚Äù After completing ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" I've decided that I must try the second book for sure (Before reading the first book I'd no idea how I'm gonna read the first one either). The first book was truly a fantastic thriller with decades old corrupted disappearance which was as mysterious as the fourth message of the Kryptos to everyone, well... nearly everyone until Herr Blomkvist found that those numbers were not just telephone numbers but something incogitable and that there were still more pictures in some abandoned archives which led to ultimate solution of the 40 year old mystery, and obviously it would be insurmountable without the great helps and the curiosity of the tattooed girl Lisbeth Salander, who also helped in clearing his name from billionaire's affair. And after reading some moderate books I'd decided to try something virile and mysterious enough to fill my boredom, hence I chose to read ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"". This book had much amplified start than the first one and an elementary insight of Mathematics from a book 'Dimensions in mathematics' later the Harvard press confirmed that no such book exist and the author too was a fictional one. Then it went on smooth until Salander was struck in a great conspiracy, which doesn't just concern about her and a gang of hooligans, but the entire Sweden government is behind this highly classified cover-up. In which the journalist Blomkvits was ready to loose anything to prove that she was innocent. But the real enigma was 'was Salander really innocent?' whose incommensurable character will keep us guessing. This is a great suspense novel which shows a great deal of satire in most part of the book.  The main theme of the book is to portrait the sex trafficking in Sweden and the imports of a number of little girls from poor backgrounds from nations like Russia, who were initially promised of good education and decent jobs, but later deceived to become whores and drug addicts. The second book was really good but not as great as the first one. And it also contains unnecessary biographies of almost all the characters in it.

82,95592800,03/24/2010,2.0,"I think I understand what all the hype is about. Or do I? I can't be so sure.Lisbeth Salander's story is interesting in the sense that it's unusual and at times gripping. She's a brilliant, fearless, introverted heroine with an unconventional life story and an axe to grind with contemporary Swedish society. Framed for the murder of two authors set to publish an expose on the illicit sex trade in Sweden, the tiny, dark, pierced and tattooed Lisbeth by day, blonde Norwegian alter ego Irene Nesser by night (so to speak) -- a Swedish Lady Gaga with a penchant for violence and hacking computers -- disappears. So watching her story unfold is the stuff books are made of. However, this second installment in the Millennium series is not nearly as gripping as the first, and at times feels disjointed from a storytelling perspective. In fact, to me it felt largely like a long and winding journalistic report of a crime investigation focused disproportionately on the pointless background and side stories of the secondary characters involved at the police and investigative organizations.For much of the novel I felt myself pushing through rather than being led on the thrill ride as I was with Dragon Tattoo. Only in the last hundred pages did that feeling I love in reading -- that urge to read a little more, and then just a little bit more to find out what happens next -- actually come.

85,57058764,05/23/2009,5.0,"September 2019: I want to talk more about Dragan Armansky's idea that Lisbeth is the perfect victim. I touched on it down below in my 2012 review, but it has stayed with me. Everything in this book points to him being right. Lisbeth's past, and current events involving the triple murders that Lisbeth is blamed and hunted for, they perfectly prime her to be someone who is easily blamed or taken advantage of. The first thing being she doesn't trust authority figures at all, and she works alone. She doesn't for one second consider going to the police and telling them the truth, because those people have never helped her, in fact they locked her up as a child when she needed to be protected most. This leaves her without allies (aside from Blomkvist), and it leaves those on the other side with no information to balance out false narratives and fearful assumptions. What they are left with are the bits and pieces of Lisbeth's life that she hasn't been able to keep private, and that without context or compassion, lead everyone to think the worst of her. She is quiet (sullen, most likely unintelligent), she wears all black and has all those piercings and tattoos (criminal, social outcast), she has a previous sex partner who is a woman (lesbian) and acquaintances who are in a metal band (Satanist Cult), she was picked up in the company of an older man once (prostitute), she's been arrested for assault and locked up in an asylum (she is violent and deranged), etc. etc. All of these things make sense in the context of her life, but because she's so private and doesn't share information, her Otherness makes her visible. It makes her a target, with no one but Blomkvist willing to put in the work of figuring out what's really going on; he's the only person that investigates assuming she is innocent. Even Armansky believes she's guilty of the murders, though he believes she was probably somehow justified or provoked.Not to mention that we find out late in this book that she is a literal sacrificial pawn by the Swedish government, who prioritized keeping the secret of their defected, violent, criminal Soviet spy over the rights and freedoms of his daughter.With all of that stacked against her, she is still resourceful and proactive. When we finally get to that climax, having learned so much more about her over the course of the book than we were shown in the first book, it's agonizing to watch her suffer. For as smart as she is, going it alone does not work out for her. The only reason she survives is because she let Blomkvist back into her life a tiny bit, and he was able to figure everything out and get to her before she died. If I'm remembering correctly, the next book is about bringing all of this into the light, and watching as the small circle of people that care about her come to her defense, and watching her let them in, and allowing them to help her. This book blows everything up. The next one puts it all back together.February 2012: This book is when you realize that the Millennium trilogy is really all about Lisbeth Salander. It takes up all the threads woven into place in Dragon Tattoo and starts to make a tapestry of them: Lisbeth's mysterious back-story, what's she's done with the fortune she stole from Hans Erik Wennerstr√∂m, the continued consequences of her guardian Bjurman raping her (and the revenge that is currently represented by the tattoo on his stomach), and the reappearance of her former guardian, Holger Palmgren -- not to mention her relationship with Mikael Blomkvist. The book is structured around solving the murders of two people who were working on an expos√© on sex trafficking for Millennium, and due to unforeseen circumstances, it's Lisbeth the police are hunting for the murder. The police, Blomkvist and Millennium, and Lisbeth's old employer, Dragan Armansky, are all trying to solve the murders at the same time, and they all have different reasons for doing so. What they really end up investigating is Lisbeth's life, and they find secrets there that even she didn't know.Also fulfilled from Dragon Tattoo is Dragan Armansky's premonition that Lisbeth would be the perfect victim, which sounds kind of offensive at first, but after having read this book, I see what he means. She is Other in almost every way imaginable, and thus she is the perfect bogeyman, the perfect scapegoat. The media in the novel plays on Sweden's (and our very human) cultural obsession with social deviance; it's the kind of simplistic scapegoating that always assumes that different equals evil. She is presumed to be the murderer based on the preconceived notions of men who don't even know her. Without directly stating it, Larsson is indicting the infrastructure of the criminal justice system and the men who run it -- they let their prejudices about mental illness, sexuality, gender (the assumption that Lisbeth is a prostitute, just because she likes sex) influence the way they investigate these murders. And of course he sticks some men in there who just hate women, because they feel threatened by them.The one criticism I have isn't really a criticism, as it doesn't hamper my enjoyment of the story. The book is structured so that the reader may be left in doubt as to whether Salander committed the murders, but it's almost a waste of time. There is never a moment's doubt about Salander's innocence. We've come to know and trust her over the course of a book and a half, and we know that she would never murder two innocent people, especially people who have devoted a significant portion of their lives to exposing the men who make a living -- or gain sexual pleasure -- from exploiting and harming women. Structurally, The Girl Who Played With Fire is also notable for the distinct lack of interaction -- save for in its last two pages -- of its two leads. Blomkvist and Salander spend the whole book apart, as Salander isn't sure how to deal with her feelings for him, or with the hurt pride that comes with them. One of the things I like most about their relationship is how stupid Lisbeth feels for loving Blomkvist. She has no capacity for understanding her own feelings, or the feelings of others, and can't fathom that Blomkvist might really care for her, even if it's not in the way she wishes. She expects the worst of people, and for just a second there she let herself believe Blomkvist was different, so it was all the more painful for her when she realized she'd let him in where he could hurt her the most. It makes me sad. (Incidentally, I think that Rooney Mara did an impeccable job conveying that tender and guarded emotionality in Fincher's film, something that I felt was lacking in Noomi Rapace's version of Lisbeth, and that's probably why I prefer the Fincher film over the Swedish original.)Lastly, I just want to take a minute to talk about the unbelievable badassery of Lisbeth digging herself out of her own grave. I just love her so much.February 2010: This book totally ruined my weekend (by not letting me stop reading it). More thoughts up HERE.",12,-0.9994,0.184,0.721,0.095,0.5465606124455682,NEGATIVE,0.9463
86,48243252,03/04/2009,2.0,"I like Larsson, at least I think I would if I had had the chance to meet him while he was living. Thus far in his Millenium trilogy he seems to be a feminist. He writes unapologetically about sexuality. He's on a crusade against misogyny in all levels of society. (My apologies to New Critics here) Problem is, he smacks the reader in the face with his crusade and downright preaches at times. Every incident seems to include some undercurrent of sexism, and the line between moral and amoral, good and evil, is too clearly proclaimed by characters' attitudes toward women. Reality is not this clarion. After a a grand total of more than 1200 pages living with his protagonists and their endeavors in Sweden's squalid underworld of crime, I think I might've had enough. I know their eating, drinking, and smoking habits by now --- cafe lattes, cheese sandwiches, and a smoke (and complaint from Berger) for Blomkvist, Billy's Pizza, black coffee, and a smoke on the balcony for Salander. This predictability, unfortunately, is a hallmark of the novel. No matter what, I know our protagonists will survive every grueling and near deadly ordeal and solve the mystery to everyone's satisfaction. Girl with a Dragon Tattoo, the first installment of his Millenium trilogy, is stimulating and refreshing --- a bisexual, venturesome, audacious heroine in a black leather jacket solves mysteries and fights crime together with a once reputable journalist trying to salvage his reputation. Larsson just couldn't keep the freshness and vigor in The Girl Who Played With Fire. It's stale and repetitive, and I grew numb and indifferent to the hundreds of miraculous exploits that Larrson flings and tosses into the novel.

She's such a complex and tortured and amazing character. These books would be amazing if they were more focused on her. As is, they're still really good, but the side plots that aren't about her annoy me.

92,481885241,12/20/2012,4.0," On the rear cover of Vintage Crime's 2009 publication of The Girl Who Played With Fire, the reader gains a glimpse of Stieg Larsson. Cradling an almost gaunt face with his left hand, his expression seemingly radiates the time and energy put into the writing of what would become his lasting legacy, the Millennium trilogy. He clearly inserted his heart and soul into them. Additionally, he appears hopeful that his work would be well-received. Indeed, it has. As of December 2011, the series--collectively-- had sold 65 million copies, resulting in three #1 bestsellers. Even today, that number is continually on the rise. Interestingly enough, this has all taken place posthumously. Resuming approximately one year after the life-altering events of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, we're treated with a lengthy section revolving around our favorite sleuth, Lisbeth Salander. A significantly different Salander, spending time abroad, as though distance will somehow help rectify the past.  This proves to be a relatively calm time in her life, time often spent patronizing a local pub and, to an extent, socializing with the primary bartender. However minimal said exchanges were, they marked an altogether different side of our heroine. It's a nice change. It is here that Larsson expertly discloses much about her, and how she thinks, reacts, perceives. Perhaps most telling is her fascination with puzzles. We, in fact, learn that she's been fascinated with them (and all things mathematical,) since a very young age. The mastering of the Rubik's cube was most definitely a defining moment of her life. More so, it was probably one of her first of many successes.  And as incredibly relevant and deeply profound as this was, I soon realized that Larsson actually hinted at Salander's unique thought process, through Blomkvist's perspective, in the previous installment: ""...A talent for seeing patterns and understanding abstract reasoning where other people only perceive white noise..."" By doing this, he takes the novel (and the series as a whole,) many steps forward. It is very much Salander's book, or story, if you will. The excessive presence of our sassy, technological prodigy is clearly evident, for she's seen here much more than in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, possibly even more than all three books combined. A somewhat subtle example of this is the various sections (or parts,) showcasing brief, albeit interesting insights pertaining to math, equations, and the like: ""Those pointless equations, to which no solution exists, are called absurdities."" (a+b) (a-b) = a2-b2 +1 Hence, I've digressed.. Beneath the consistent character development of both Mikeal and Lisbeth is, of course, the plot itself. When a friend of Blomkvist's informs him that he (and long-time girlfriend Mia Johanson,) are in the process of exposing an extensive sex-trafficking operation, Blomkvist is drawn in, agreeing to shed some light on this growing problem.  On the eve of its publication, the couple are murdered. Making matters worse, Salander's prints are found on the murder weapon. Is she guilty, innocent, or something in the middle? In the process, extenuation circumstances force her to face a dark, troubled past. It's done in such an indescribable way that while it seems that Larsson is calling all the shots, never once did it feel contrived.  Later on, however, there's one particular revelation which feels very much contrived, IMO, centered around Ron ""the blond giant"" Niedermann. I didn't buy this at all. I still don't, actually. I'm just not feeling it..   ""Zala's"" HUGE announcement really floored me, though. To the point that I literally called out in utter shock,"" ""Whhhaaatttt!?!""If that isn't a jaw-dropping moment, I don't know what is. Sadly towards the end, the story became slightly predictable. For example, I'd been hearing about how the last few pages would compel me to immediately jump into the next book. And I would have, if not for the fact that I kind of saw it coming (those of you who've read it know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.) (view spoiler)[On a related note, it seemed pretty convenient that Blomkvist managed to locate her, and arrive just in time.. (hide spoiler)] Oh, one last question: what the heck happened with those involved in the prologue?? Where did they go, who were they, did she ever get away?? I realize that it had something to do with the sex-trafficking, but it doesn't really go anywhere. If it isn't clear, then is it actually serving a purpose?? Overall, a fantastic, fascinating thrill-ride from start to finish. My favorite of the three, thus far!  ",10,0.9875,0.035,0.874,0.091,0.4918235294117647,POSITIVE,0.9994

I have read this in 2017. Unlike the first book of the series, Lisbeth, now, is the true star. Indeed, she occupies center stage, as the book starts in the Caribbean isle of Grenada.

Many events concern Lisbeth's dark past, which in the first chapter were only a little intuited and which here are instead more revealed. Many events concern the investigation into the trafficking of prostitutes from the East and the violence involving politicians, policemen, corrupt judges and even the secret services. The style of Stieg Larsson is (fortunately) the same as that of the first chapter of the trilogy: dark, raw, very detailed, capable in a few anxious lines, of making you fall completely into the story: you can never really get away from the pages.

Kicks butts of guys twice her size with only a cigarette case for help! Oh and solves Fermat's last theorem while she's at it.

Guys. Guys. I'm finally done. I have been living in this world since January and I'm equal parts relieved and saddened to set this one back on my bookshelf. I read this book in little sips at work on my breaks, moving in and out of the story at odd intervals... and honestly, Stieg Larsson‚Äôs books are perfect for consumption as such. Despite my snail's pace and the fact that TGWPwF sometimes reads like you might never finish it, I found that I eventually got to a point where I didn't mind taking my time with the story. I was completely enamored with the world all the more this time around. (And for context, see how I spent the majority of my January and February: hyperfixating on the 2011 movie of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Lisbeth/Mikael, respectively.)Minus Lisbeth and Mikael, most of the book's strengths (and frustrations) definitely lie in how Stieg Larsson sets up and reveals answers to the mystery in dribs and drabs. I was so dang hooked when he up and abandons Lisbeth's POV right smack at the start of the murder investigation, so we're left in a cold sweat, wondering how she's responding to the entire situation (which turns out to be in typical Salander fashion). But that's not to say this section is completely devoid of activity, especially since the majority of its scenes had me internally pacing in outrage over how WRONG everyone was about Lisbeth. Thankfully, however, a lot of it played out exactly as I wanted it to, which is just... *inhales*... CHEF'S KISS. That ending (cruel af, knowing I'm probably not reading book #3 for a bit) had me clutching my heart because it parallels book #1 so beautifully. And truly, I know I've already said it once, but I'll do it again, emphasized with the swears. Shit. Goddamn. 
I fucking love Lisbeth Salander.
So that four star rating. Yeah. *sighs* Reflecting on TGWPwF as a whole, I noticed I had some massive deja vu over how similar my feelings for this book were in juxtaposition to book #1. Although the book tries to appear completely mapped out from start to finish, the cohesion just isn't always there (and I 100% acknowledge this could be saved in book #3)‚Äîlooking at where the book starts and ends, you'd think I was reading two completely different stories. Although I love (LOVE) that we get more background about Lisbeth, I still felt like I was left with two stories that didn't feel fully fleshed-out or connected by the end. So many things needed more clarification and follow-ups, but a lot of the focus lands more on Salander's backstory (which got repetitive at points) and less on the mystery that starts everything. There were also a few clunky pieces of dialogue/internal monologuing (I'm specifically thinking of Salander's confrontation with Lundin) that I felt lessened the quality of work.BUT YEAH. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I still absolutely adore the world and characters Stieg Larsson created‚Äîfor real, I had so many pocket scenarios pop up in my head involving Lisbeth that I feel like I could eventually write fanfic for‚Äîand that just cannot be diminished by TGWPwF's faults.

Second and nextmost I have to say that I still do not give one rat's ass about Lisbeth Salander.Wait, let me qualify that.I think I probably could really like Lisbeth Salander, but I don't like what Larsson has done with her as a character. I was annoyed by the first book because it was evident that Larsson had a penchant for surly girls with combat boots which (I believe) is a brand-new thing in Sweden because he was way too fascinated by her for me to believe that surly girls are at all the norm in his country.But in this second book she sort of cleans herself up a bit. I'm not really a fan of that, but okay. However, then she went and did something I'm totally baffled by. In this second book she shows up with a fresh boob job. A what now? A boob job.This is so uncharacteristic of her, I can barely deal with it. I realize that the purpose was something along the lines of making herself unrecognizable, as she does some other things with that purpose in mind. Then Larsson seems a little fixated on them in the beginning, only to never reference them again. I thought that they would serve a purpose in the story, like they would include Go-Go-Gadget-nipples! or would serve as a flotation device or something. But they were never mentioned again, which leaves me to believe Larsson simply wanted to feminize Lisbeth more than she had been previously - something I don't think was necessary at all. She cared too much about her new breasteses which I had a hard time really wrapping my mind around since normally she's such a bad-ass and all. The Lisbeth Salander I thought I knew wouldn't give two fucks about her body to begin with, and then wouldn't give two more fucks about her new breasts to the point that she has to have sex with a 16-year-old boy for the first time after getting them, I guess to like break them in or whatever? She wanted to make sure they looked normal, that much I got. Lisbeth? Caring what someone thought of her titties? I'm not buying it.(This may be the most I've ever talked about boobies in a review. Ever.)Other than that, the story really is okay. I felt it was more of a page-turner than the first book, and I certainly cared more this time - at least I cared enough to try to keep all the names straight. Still, I'm sorry, I managed to confuse Blomkvist and Bublanski in my head. Whatever, they both start with the letter B. And I'm lazy.There's less graphic, violence sex in this one. Y'know, if that's important to you. There's still violence though, and some good bits of that, I might add. Not American Psycho-violent, but a nice enough amount to not seem completely out of line for the story.I've read some reviews that complain that Lisbeth disappears for most of the book; it's probably not surprising but I actually liked it when she was out of the picture. Not that she was fully out of the picture. They talked about her a lot. TOO much, as far as I was concerned. It was all IKEA, 7-Eleven, Billy's Pan Pizza, and LISBETH. Lisbeth is amazing, Lisbeth can do no wrong, Lisbeth is a dyke, Lisbeth isn't a dyke, Lisbeth will cut you, Lisbeth wouldn't kill anyone, Lisbeth had a bad past, OMG what was Lisbeth's bad past. I think the book could have been cut in half if the editors had just removed all of the times Blomkvist puts Lisbeth up on a pedestal. Once was enough. Anything after that was redundant. Faste is a prick, got it. Move on. The guy with a ponytail is a tank. Noted. Mimmie Wu is into some raunchy things. Jeez, who cares.It still sounds like I didn't really like the book, doesn't it? I don't know what to do about that. It kept my interest, I'm not disgusted by it, and I consider it to be a step above a ""popcorn read"" which is what I considered the first book. I still don't think these books are nearly as incredible as everyone thinks they are, but this is the first time I finally got an inkling as to what my be considered appealing by the masses.",8,0.9903,0.076,0.801,0.123,0.4942777192777193,NEGATIVE,0.9999
113,1154313398,01/03/2015,5.0,"It's a shame that Larsson only wrote 3 books. I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel and I found it hard to put down. I strongly suggest reading the ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" fist, it will give you background on the main characters you will not find in this storyline. I loved the characters and the plot line, it had me at the edge of my seat. I can't wait to get started with the last book of the series.The Girl Who Played with Fire is a shockingly brilliant story that sees Lisbeth Salander on the run from police after the double murder of a criminologist and a journalist investigating the sex trade in Sweden. The evidence points to Salander being the killer but Mikael Blomkvist believes that Lisbeth is not guilty and is determined to uncover the truth. A brilliant story that ends with an awesome cliffhanger that will leave you hungry for The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.The Girl Who Played With Fire continues the story of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, approximately one year after The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Angry with Blomkvist and herself, Lisbeth has spent the past year traveling around the world. She returns to Sweden extremely wealthy (from an electronic heist), and begins to create a different life for herself, severing contact with large parts of her past, including Blomkvist.Lisbeth is quickly drawn into an intrigue involving Bjurman, her court ordered and immoral guardian, human trafficking, and Estonian gangsters. Unfortunate timing casts Lisbeth as a suspect in three murders. Hunted by the police and her own past, Lisbeth goes undercover to ensure that her own brand of justice is served.Blomkvist, who continued to try to speak with Lisbeth, is tied to two of the murder victims who were researching a book and article on human trafficking for his magazine to publish. While Lisbeth is hiding from the Swedish police and enemies she cannot yet name, she hacks into Blomkvist's computer and trades cryptic messages with him about the crimes.Set against a cold Swedish background, The Girl Who Played With Fire delves deeply into Lisbeth's character, contrasting her mathematical brilliance with her struggles with interpersonal skills and relationships. In parallel to the multi-layered conspiracy plot, the novel explores the thoughts and feelings of the people who, despite everything, care for Lisbeth and do not believe she could commit premeditated murder.The Girl Who Played With Fire is a compelling story with a fascinating variety of subplots and complex, imperfect, and brave characters, all of which seamlessly work together to culminate in an ending that the reader is eager to discover while being reluctant for the book to end.Larsson is a writer who disdained short cuts. Every facet of Salander's personality is carefully and delicately explored, from her newfound fascination with mathematics (in the midst of her final confrontation with the ghosts of her pasts, she suddenly realizes the solution to Fermat's last theorem) to the way in her which her perception of what constitutes a home flies in the face of what anyone else may mean by that word. (In one of the myriad small, telling details, Blomkvist discovers Salander's new apartment, which we've only seen through her eyes up until then; the way Larsson shows the reader what it really is, compared to Salader's view of it, is more moving and significant than any piece of dramatic action or dialogue could possibly be.)Entwining the investigations into the murders so closely with Salander's past is a risky gambit, raising the possibility of the series of events being viewed as contrived coincidences. But Larsson pulls that off, triumphantly. The details of the plot, it now seems clear, however dramatic and gripping they are in their own right, are a backdrop to the unfolding story of Lisbeth Salander and her world and 'relationships'; a world that will continue in Larsson's third -- and tragically, final -- volume in a series that he had planned to extend into several more books.

114,1726552481,08/12/2016,5.0,"After the intriguing events of the first novel in the ‚ÄúMillennium Trilogy‚Äù (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) the major characters start out this book in a nice place. Life is good and it is time to get back to the more normal challenges of life. Of course things can‚Äôt stay that way or we wouldn‚Äôt have two more books in the series to enjoy. The plot gets going with magazine publisher Mikael Blomkvist having decided to pursue his next major expose, this time about a sprawling sex-trafficking operation. Meanwhile, hacker extraordinaire and socially challenged Lisbeth Salander is finding good uses for her financial windfall from the first book. A small problem arises when two of Mikael‚Äôs business partners are brutally murdered and it just so happens that Salander‚Äôs fingerprints are on the murder weapon.I do believe I actually liked this second book even better than the first. I didn‚Äôt feel that way at first because the first quarter of the novel was fairly uneventful. I didn‚Äôt mind too much because the author‚Äôs writing style is pleasant and I didn‚Äôt mind being a voyeur into these character‚Äôs everyday lives. But I was starting to grow mildly impatient for the adventure to begin. Once it did though, the book didn‚Äôt let up for a second. All the way to the end for a huge cliffhanger. I seem to be running into those a lot lately. This might bother some readers but, fortunately, I already have the next book on the shelf ready to go.I‚Äôm certainly not the first to point out the character of Lisbeth Salander as being one of the most interesting and intriguing in all of literature. The first novel managed to maintain quite a bit of mystery about her history and what sort of childhood traumas she had experienced to result in such an interesting adult‚Ä¶and yet still build her as a sympathetic character. But I was very happy to discover so much of her backstory in this book and see what it was that molded her persona. Lots of surprises here too, all serving the overall development of the plot as well.Perhaps what made this novel such a good read for me was the author‚Äôs ability to tell the story from multiple points of view and yet only reveal small bits of information all the way through. That is a real balancing act to pull off but I always knew what I needed to know. I also realized there was more to learn‚Ä¶and that crushing desire to find out what was actually happening just below the surface led me to that ‚Äújust one more chapter before bedtime‚Äù syndrome.

115,323721954,05/04/2012,3.0,"3.5 starsThe first two books in this trilogy have been an exhilarating, albeit disturbing, roller coaster ride. Lisbeth Salander is hands down the most intriguing and complex character I have ever read. She takes rooting for the under dog to a whole new level. Mikael, while not nearly as multilayered as Lisbeth, plays off of her well and easily held my interest. I fell in love with both characters in  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, despite Mr. Larsson's penchant for tediously lengthy explanations of everything. The book really didn't take off for me until nearly 10 chapters in. I almost put it down numerous times - I mean let's face it, if a book hasn't grabbed your attention 3-4 chapters in chances are it's not for you. However, several co-workers who had read the series encouraged me to keep going, and I'm glad I did.I was so excited to start The Girl Who Played With Fire. I'd stayed up to 3 am a few nights reading TGWTDT, so I was looking forward to more of the same, but this time I'd be on vacation. To say that I was initially disappointed would be the understatement of the decade. Had it not been for my near obsessive need to know what happens to Lisbeth, I would have tossed this in my unfinished book graveyard. The first 2/3 of the book literally dragged on for days. There was so much filler and inconsequential information (do we really need to know precisely what's on Lisbeth's grocery list EVERY TIME she goes to the market?!?!?). Nonetheless, the final third of the book was so explosive and fast paced that it helped with the narrow escape of a two star rating. Despite the repetition and the endless pages of drivel, the book suffers most because of Mikael and Lisbeth's limited contact throughout. These books are at their best when Lisbeth and Mikael are working together - face to face. I'll admit that I love romance(you can take the romance out of the book, but not out of the girl), and am hoping against hope that they end up together in  The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest. However, when the dust finally settles, what I want most is to see Lisbeth triumph.For all of their faults these books are definitely worth reading. As I prepare to read the final book I know regardless of how I feel about it in the end, Lisbeth Salander is one of those characters that will stay with me forever.

They kept stopping at McDonald's and Burger King, and I have to say that it made me a little crazy. Was that the choice of the translator? Put in an American fast food chain, instead of listing a local one? Or a non-chain place? Certainly those brands added nothing to the story. And if they HAD to add American chains, why not Starbucks? Given all the coffee that was consumed in this book, there could have been one or two Starbucks visits. Frankly, I'd believe those over McDonald's...This book was good and as crazily interwoven as the first, and it kept me involved from page 1, which I started yesterday on the deck; to page 503, which I finished this afternoon. Really, it's a very hard book to put down.I'd been told it wasn't as upsetting or violent as the first one, but it was definitely in the family. Frankly I was surprised that it started with the Prologue, given what I'd been told about this one in comparison to Dragon Tattoo.But it was good, and definitely had sympathetic characters, and I really, really wanted the new IKEA-furnished apartment to be enjoyed.

Is there anything left to extract from poor Lisbeth's 90-lb frame? I'll have to wait to find out, as I'm #149 on the library list :)The one thing I'd have changed about this book if I'd been the editor was to start referring to her as Lisbeth instead of Salander close to the end.

How do I know that Blomkvist is a tenacious but naive renegade reporter? Every other character in the book say or thinks it about 1,000 times. No character is permitted to encounter a consumer product without listing it's full name (and processing speed and memory if the product is a computer). No character can travel from point to point without a description of the entire route traversed. No character eats a meal that goes undescribed.As a small example of the repetitiveness, we are reminded several times how Salander happened upon a gun (the incident when she took the gun is one of the few scenes in the novel where anything happens, so we are likely to remember, but whatevs). Later Blomkvist discovers the gun and we are again reminded how Salander came up on it. Plus we are told that Blomkvist doesn't know how she got the gun because he wasn't there.

She is such a strong character that makes you want to know her entire story and see where she'll end up. Not to mention, these books shed light on the very dark world of sex trafficking and the objectification of women, in all facets of society. It did get thick at points for me with keeping all the connections and characters separated, but that did not take very much away from the overall plot. I'm also a stickler for finality in books, and being a series, you can't expect too much. The ending here, however, was done well despite leaving several open ends (again, the rest of the series likely covers all those questions). Overall, a great sequel to the first book.Goosie Scale Rating: 4/10Any scene with Lisbeth sticking it to the man is intense and will likely get you going, but in regards to goosebumps, I think there is more to be desired. Of course, that doesn't mean this was not a great read!First Sentence Rating: 6/10""She lay on her back, fastened by leather straps to a narrow bed with a steal frame.""Knowing where this sentence is likely taking you based off the premise of the first book, it's extremely depressing and sick.

While the plot of the novel, an investigation of a sex trafficking operation in Sweden, is interesting and deeply disturbing, Larrson's vapid storytelling and one dimensional characters renders the book's sole redeeming quality moot.Cardboard heroine Lisbeth Salander, a genius computer hacker, a genius mathematician, a genius of pouty introspection, uses much of her time and genius spending ill-gotten cash on expensive shopping sprees, well over a hundred pages of gratuitous shopping, while dodging the villainous intentions of dangerous enemies; alas, the suspense that would normally be associated with life threatening circumstances becomes a fluffy, tiresome after-thought thanks to the endless pages of Salander's rampant consumerism. Larrson pads his lackluster thriller with unrelenting descriptions of objects, sex, and travel routes, ostensibly at the service of his paper thin character development; none of this verbal bloat helps to move the 503 paged story along, or adds depth to his characters. Perhaps the editors left the fat in, if the book even had editors, to help justify the $26.95 cover price. I don't know, and I don't care. I couldn't finish the book.

The 
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
, last year, and as soon as book two came out in paperback a couple of months ago I grabbed a copy (I did pay for it). Then she told me it has a real cliffhanger ending, and that she'd send me book 3 (which wasn't even out here at the time). I waited till it arrived and then last weekend I took this one up to the cottage. It's perfect sunny day, waterside reading.The main events are set about a year after the end of the first book, and aren't directly related to the mystery of that book. Lisbeth Salander, twenty-five, less than five feet tall and a skilled computer hacker, has broken off all communication with Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist she helped and had a relationship with in the first book. She has her stolen billions from the corporate criminal Wennerstr√∂m and takes a year off, travelling around the world. When she returns to Stockholm, she makes some changes in her life. She buys an expensive condo and a car, reconnects with her friend Mimmi, and checks up on her state-appointed guardian, Bjurman.She can't resist hacking into Blomkvist's computers and seeing what's he's working on: a feature and a book written by another journalist, Dag Svensson, on sex trafficking. Dag's partner, Mia Johansson, is doing her PhD on the same topic, though from a different angle. It's an absorbing project that Mikael is editing, and Salander doesn't become really interested until a name turns up in the research: Zala.On the same night Lisbeth visits Dag and Mia to find out what they know about Zala, the couple are murdered. The murder weapon is a gun owned by Bjurman with Lisbeth's fingerprints on it.Suddenly Salander is a fugitive, wanted for mass murders. Her history - or choice parts of it - are splashed across the papers and embellished. Only Blomkvist is sure of her innocence - and he intends to prove it. Of course Salander has her own plans, and everything centres on the mysterious unknown figure of Zala.This is one very tight novel. While book 1 started off slow and had some even slower patches to get through, this second book is fast-paced and never dull. I was deeply engrossed and read most of the hefty book in one day (it helped to be lazing around at the cottage with few distractions!). From the beginning it held my absolute attention. The characters, established in the first book, become so much real here. Lisbeth in particular becomes the main attraction, and even reading about what she buys from IKEA for her new apartment engrossed me. (For readers who complain about ""irrelevant"" details in books, they'll no doubt hate this. Larsson's style is very detail-oriented at times.)We learn about Lisbeth's past, and get her side of the story - as well as the psychiatrist's. Continuing the theme from book one of ""men who hate women"", The Girl Who Played With Fire has several note-worthy bigots, chauvinists, misogynists and downright arrogant bastards (the original Swedish title of book 1, Maria told me, translates directly into English as ""men who hate women"". But I can see why they changed it and went with ""the girl who...""). It's interesting, men like these populate a lot of fiction, TV shows and movies, and we just accept them. They tend to be clich√©s, true to type, and familiar. But we never really see the damage they do, the bigger context such attitudes creates, how they really affect women - as a gender. That's what's really highlighted in The Girl Who Played With Fire. It threads its way through the entire novel, not front-and-centre but consistently present. And it helps you see just how far we haven't come.The maths references were beyond me, and I could only vaguely get the metaphors at the beginning of each part. Frankly it was like reading another language. I was still interested in Salander's mathematical hobby, but at the end where she suddenly figures out Fermat's equation, I'm impressed at her skill but have no idea if it was meant to be clear to me as well. I don't even understand what the puzzle was! (and please don't bother trying to explain it to me. I just don't have a mathematical background to follow.)I was glued to this book - for someone who doesn't read and doesn't care for crime fiction, detective stories etc (unless they're literary, which sounds so snobby, but just means that I need better character development and greater detail than you get from the actual genre), it seems like a big deal to me. This isn't just a crime to be solved, a mystery to puzzle out, a whodunnit. It touches on deeper social issues, is dark and gritty and unabashedly violent but never, I think, gratuitous; and every character is one that becomes tangible. It's like those rare TV shows where the characters become so familiar they're like an extended family - which is what every network hopes to achieve with every show, don't they? I'd say Larsson succeeded exceptionally well with the Millennium books. As soon as I'd finished this one, I picked up the third, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

134,70451484,09/08/2009,4.0,"This book is the second of three in Larsson's series featuring Lisbeth Salander, the young woman who has her own sense of morality and acts on it accordingly. As this book opens, we find young Lisbeth in the Caribbean after the events of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Meanwhile, the erstwhile reporter Kalle Blomkvist and the team at Millennium are sitting on top of a goldmine of a story. With the help of a woman who is finishing her PhD thesis and that of her husband, who is writing a book based on her findings, Blomkvist is ready to publicly uncover a scandal in which some high-ranking officials are involved in sex trafficking from Russia and other parts of eastern Europe into Sweden. Eventually Lisbeth returns home, and goes into hiding. After a triple homicide, the police become interested in finding her (as does Blomkvist) because the clues at the murder scenes lead directly back to her. At this point, Blomkvist, who is absolutely convinced that Lisbeth is innocent, begins his own investigation, working from a different starting point than that of the police. I love Lisbeth's character -- she refuses to be a victim even though her life is on the line. She's a take-charge kind of person, apologizing to no one, and she is definitely an example of someone whose past has created her present. She's a heroine unlike any other you'll find in crime writing -- very flawed, dark, unafraid, with a sense of morality that she acts on even if it goes against the social grain. There are very few people in her life whom she trusts, and definitely has no love for official institutions. The book is fast paced, with never a dull moment, and is a solid sequel to Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I would definitely recommend that anyone thinking about this book start with Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, because there are a number of references in the 2nd book that you won't understand if you don't, and because once things start unraveling, you need to have the background of events from the first book, especially with the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomkvist. Girl Who Played With Fire leaves some things hanging, which I'm sure will be picked up in the upcoming third book (hopefully, since it's the last one). I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, solid mystery novel and who doesn't mind that the characters are all a bit flawed. Not a cozy mystery at all, so if that's what you're looking for, skip it. Otherwise, sit back and try to clear your day because you won't want to put this one down. Fans of Scandinavian crime novels will absolutely not be disappointed. ",7,0.9875,0.057,0.807,0.136,0.4088425925925926,POSITIVE,0.9982

Given that Lisbeth's character was the driving force of my enjoyment of the first book, it's a little shocking how sick of her I got throughout this book.

It's how people often end up being convicted of crimes they didn't commit. The book also explores media sensationalism in crime reporting, homophobia, and misogyny among law enforcement. When Lisbeth Salander's fingerprints are found on a gun used to murder three people in two separate incidents, she becomes the top and really only suspect in the case. Reports from when she was institutionalized portraying her as a violent, psychotic, and mentally slow young woman with a history of prostitution make her seem like the obvious suspect. Lisbeth of course has a brilliant mind and is easily able to hide from the police while she and Mikael Blomkvist try to solve the case.

154,2245194363,01/05/2018,4.0," ‚ÄúThere are no innocents. There are, however, different degrees of responsibility.‚Äù In this book, you absolutely cannot trust anything you read. Be suspicious of everyone. Larsson manages to pull plot twists even those of us with refined deductive reasoning skills have trouble predicting. Although I enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo more than this book, I appreciated the intelligent narrative of the story. To me, this is so much more than a book. Larsson uses The Girl Who Played with Fire to reveal compelling and uncomfortable truths about society and human nature. The characters feel so raw, so real - especially Salander and Blomkvist. These 2 are the light in this very dark and graphic story. In a way, they are both outsiders trying to fight against a corrupted society. This book is a continuation of  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , which was pretty awesome, so naturally one has to read its predecessor. I do not want to focus too much on the plot of  ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" , but here are the basics: it deals with human trafficking, murder, and corruption. I think that covers the major themes. My only issue with this book is the pacing. In retrospective, this was a flaw in the first book too. Often times there are so many unnecessary details that they take away from a rather compelling plot. In my opinion, this book could be improved if it focused more on the plot, which is its strength, as opposed to describing in vivid detail every single piece of furniture in an apartment building. Although some readers might feel like this adds to their reading experience, I felt like for me, it stopped this book from being a page-turner, which it very much so had the potential of being. But other than that, this book was great. I felt like some parts were a bit unrealistic, but then again, it is a book after all and do most of us not read to escape reality? I love, love, love Salander! I think I was reading somewhere that Larsson wanted her to be different. He wanted her to question, defy and fight against barriers that were put against women. She is imperfect and strange, but so damn interesting. She has a peculiar way of dealing with things and seems to prove the people who doubt her wrong. Salander represents all of us who have been broken, and I think people who have gone through any type of trauma will be able to relate to her. On that note, although most of the men in this book are so degrading towards women, Blomkvist (and a few other male characters) contrast them by being genuine, supportive, and loving towards their female counterparts. In fact, Blomkvist spends majority of this book fighting against the sex trafficking industry. The plot of this book also had me sitting on edge at certain points. When the pacing was there,  it was there . Larsson is a talented writer - without a doubt - and crafts the most incredible action scenes and plot twists. I guessed some of the proceeding events, but others took me by complete surprise. I wanted to keep reading the story because I needed to know what happens next. Despite not being a seasoned thriller/mystery reader, I believe that is one of the hallmarks of a good book in this genre. The atmosphere in this book is also dark. Like throughout the whole story, you just feel this ominous and creepy feeling lingering in the air, and it never goes away - even during the happy scenes (yes, they do exist, but they are rare). As a reader, you know something dreadful is about to go down and that feeling never goes away. It follows you until you turn the very last page of this book. Overall, this was a fascinating read. I am so excited to read the final book in this trilogy. To be honest, I am surprised that I came to like this book because it does not align with my usual tastes. I tend to squirm and run away from anything horror related, but this book was just the right dash of suspense and thoughtful dialogue. It helped tie a lot of lose ends from the previous book and I am looking forward to seeing what happens next.",6,0.9928,0.099,0.748,0.152,0.5521974299413324,POSITIVE,0.9885

And although I've rated both books 4 stars, each was rated for completely different reasons than the other.In my review of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I have mentioned that the book was not a very good thriller, but nonetheless a very good story and social critique. I believe that Larsson‚Äôs aim with the Millennium Trilogy was much deeper than just writing a good thriller. Unfortunately, his aim was attained in the first book much more than the second. The first third of this book didn't connect with the rest of the story. I found the beginning incidents of Grenada to be detached and irrelevant to the main story. Even if it was necessary to provide some sort of continuation for the events outlined in the first book, I think the same could have been achieved with a much shorter version, without the need of a dozen characters and events that would not even be remember when the book will be done with. The other two thirds were much better constructed, embedded with very good character development and clever storytelling techniques. At the end of the book, I was left with the impression of a good thriller, for which I was looking while I picked up the first book. But, in spite of that, the story seemed to be somehow shallow compared to the first one. Even the same characters were less believable and even less intelligent in this book. Salander and Blomkvist were changed, with the former being impulsive, childish and somehow irrational, while the latter being indifferent, detached and even a bit immoral. Another thing I didn't like in this book was that it began with a very promising subject, which is that of sex trafficking, and as pages went by, the trafficking was replaced with Salander‚Äôs family history, which albeit intriguing, was less interesting than the trafficking theme. Another big downside was the ending, if it can be called as such, where the majority of the story was left unfinished. For a book of more than 600 pages, packed with cliches, unnecessary details and descriptive passages, I was expecting a more clear conclusion for some of the events.Nevertheless, the overall book is a good one with absolutely thrilling monents, and as I don‚Äôt like to rate a book based on my view of another installment, I've rated it 4 stars.

In 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' there were two sort-of main characters, Mikael Blomquist and Lisbeth Salander. The POV alternates back and forth between them; the same happens in this book but I felt my interest totally slant to Lisbeth. I constantly wanted to know where she was, what was she doing, what did she think, feel, see, do. The writing, as in the first, is meticulous in details so much so I felt I was in Stockholm, or the Swedish countryside - places which felt both familiar and foreign at the same time. I love that sensation while reading! Like, if I were on a bike I'd know where to turn to find the shop that sells the best espresso or even Billy's Pan Pizzas! (I so want to try one of them.) And though writers who deal in minute description often bore me to death, Larsson doesn't. It all fits in. It makes sense that Mikael eats this or that or that Lisbeth's million-dollar apartment has Ikea furnishings and not much else. (I am familiar with Ikea, been to their maze-like store more than once.) Anyhow...The story concerns Lisbeth's past and the repercussions of certain actions she took as a child. The details of her difficult early life are slowly - and I mean slooowly - revealed. There's no huge CLIMAX on page 288 out of 300 as in so many books. (And I know this; I love thrillers and mysteries and that's often how they play out.) Instead, one small, excruciating detail is laid down upon another equally excruciating detail until you get a mountain of them. Lisbeth unwittingly gets two journalists into BIG trouble by something she tells them, a something which unleashes a giant who's nothing more than a killing machine, a lot of shady underground characters involved in the sex trade market, and of course, Mikael, the man she loves but won't admit it. Not even to herself.And he doesn't have a clue.The book is filled with details about: police investigations; police corruption; banking; computer hacking, and so on. But seldom is there an info-dump.

Everyone thinks she is insane, but she is not, she is more than that, she is a best hacker in the world, who spends her time by solving Fermat‚Äôs theorem (have to say that she starts first from linear equations, then there is a huge jump, and bang, she is into Fermat and unsolvable things ), by the end she solves it( take a note, people couldn‚Äôt solve it for ages!), and in the rest of her spare time she experiments with her sexuality, making no difference men and women, as long as you are good in bed and not annoying, Lisbeth Salander will sleep with you.Through the book I was stressed and puzzled who was at the origin of the murders, towards the end it got boring (since I think Larsson revealed real identity of the murderer a bit soon)and at the same time the book started to remind me Indian movies, where all turn out brothers and sisters or relatives in general. I can‚Äôt NOT to feel sympathy towards Larsson, since it‚Äôs quite rare to see a feminist man, who despises misogyny, and talks in detail about rapes, and all kinds of injustice that is out there towards women, so it feels like criticizing a book of a friend of mine, but I have to admit that Larsson was crappy a writer. The language of his is very dry and I feel like I read not a book, but a report of the police. The whole book looks like collections of statements , lacking any emotions, at times when there are actually emotions, well, me personally felt nothing. The frustration, desperation, sadness or whatever he describes doesn‚Äôt touch me at all. Not because I‚Äôm heartless but cause I can‚Äôt feel it through his words. At last, I really think a few hundreds of pages could have been cut, like I don‚Äôt want to know that refrigerator of Lisbeth Salandre(that chick who is into math) is filled with nothing but frozen pizza, precooked cakes with bacon, and she drinks it up always with cola (and remains anorexique). In the first book she ate nothing but sandwhiches (see, I don‚Äôt want to remember that!!!).",6,-0.7159,0.134,0.736,0.13,0.4729444444444445,NEGATIVE,1.0

The first third of the book could have been edited with a heavy hand. The adventure that occurs in the Caribbean was completely superfluous to the story and didn't add much in character depth. Furthermore, the entire Salander and the mathematical algorithm subplot is belabored on a great deal in the beginning of the novel, and only very briefly touched upon at the end -- and unsatisfactorily, at that. The end, on the other hand, has exactly the opposite problem. The book ends directly after the climax, without any resolution. What about Salander's health? What about the book to expose the sex traffickers? What about Berger leaving Millennium? What happens to Zalachenko, Niedermann, Bjorck, and Telebroian? What was most frustrating to me about this is that the first book in the series wrapped up all its plot-lines so well, so I expected more of a resolution from this one. Obviously, I will be reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, first because these books are very well written and interesting, and second because I need to know how the events from this book resolve.

The new characters, Wu and Roberto are interesting as well, though it annoyed me that every time Roberto was referenced his full name was used. It was weird. Maybe a Swedish thing? I enjoyed this book more than the first. I loved it all from start to finish. The story was more compelling and I found it harder to put down. Larsson is great at building anticipation, but not irritatingly so. Like his first novel, he takes his time to build the story and the characters.

Though her frail figure embodies weakness and victimhood, in her spirit she is Joan of Arc, she is female empowerment, a force of will -- she is what we all strive to be when we see evil. No she is not an anti-hero. She is a hero because she refuses to accept her powerlessness. I wouldn‚Äôt even categorize her as strictly a feminist heroine (though certainly abuse against women is the thing she despises more than anything).

There‚Äôs just something about this writing style that I really enjoy and think is well done. Everything is in so much detail, which I admit could be toned down a bit. These books are really long winded and sometimes scenes are dragged out for what seems like no reason. It definitely could‚Äôve been shorter or hurried up a little bit, but the slow pacing makes the tension here really work so I get it. I can‚Äôt help but be absolutely fascinated by this story and the plot regardless of how intense it gets and how uncomfortable it makes me feel at points. It‚Äôs really a story you don‚Äôt wanna look away from, you need to know where it‚Äôs going and how things are going to play out. It‚Äôs quite cleverly crafted in that way, very unpredictable and keeps you guessing. I really enjoyed reading it. The amount of characters in here and the roles they play in the plot is also impressive, alongside the fact that their personalities are so bold and identifiable is phenomenal. It just all works so well together. Again, I really hated the way Lisbeth is both talked about and characterised (am I using that word correctly? Probably not). Again, she‚Äôs infantilised constantly by those around her and there‚Äôs a lot of ableism surrounding her character. It was just very uncomfortable to read at times, and I wish a different direction was taken with her. I think she‚Äôs a great character and very complex and interesting, but sometimes I was completely thrown off.Larsson really goes in with the dark and gritty in these books which is fair enough, but the graphic torture of children is a bit intense for anyone. The opening of this book really set the tone for the rest of it, to be honest. And I HATED the fact that (really minor spoiler here) Lisbeth, who was abused as a child, sleeps with a 16 year old boy in this book - when she is 24 - and sees no issue with it. It boggled me how childlike and inexperienced he was described as being throughout and it made me uncomfortable.

Are you really going to tell me that Lisbeth, who manages to reprogram cameras in office buildings, hack police computers, and stay hidden from the law for a ridiculous length of time, is somehow dumb enough to go to Zala's lair without maybe researching what kind of security system he might have? I mean, he is supposed to be this hella-powerful bigwig or something, so...he's probably going to have something there, right?But nope, Lisbeth just charges boldly in, without regard for anything beyond revenge. This is apparently one of Sweden's best investigators and computer hackers, folks!2) I assume the reader is supposed to cheer her on, but all I could do was repeatedly hit myself over the head with the (thankfully) paperback edition of this novel while drinking a Coca-Cola Zero and debating whether more Mike's Hard Lemonade would be an acceptable beverage to consume as I slogged through this, or if some Absolut brand Swedish vodka would be better. In the meantime, I was staring at a pile of better books I could be reading, such as Burroughs' Naked Lunch or McEwan's Black Dogs and considering whether or not I should make myself some spaghetti with chunky veggie sauce.OOPS NONE OF THAT WAS RELEVANT TO THE REVIEW WAS IT?My apologies, I was hoping to grip your interest by name-dropping and adding useless details, such as the mug that the characters drink their coffee out of (LIBERAL YOUTH PARTY, YEAH!), as apparently that is one of the things that Stieg Larsson has used to capture sales of 21 MILLION (according to the back of the book, that is; who knows how many more he's sold in the year or so since then?).3) I am very surprised at how few times Blomkvist got laid in this installment. I mean, ladies were dropping their panties left and right for him in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I'm pretty sure the reader is expected to believe that every woman in Sweden who isn't a lesbian or dead must have a lady-boner for Blomkvist, but there was a surprising lack of panty-dropping going on in this novel. That's cool, though, because Blomkvist is still an undeveloped and uninteresting character. He's a journalist. He sleeps with lots of ladies. He is a tireless crusader for the truth. That's cool. But that alone is not a character. No, really, it's not.The same thing plagues all of the villains in Larsson's second novel. Why is Zalachenko an evil bastard? Because! Evil! Every story needs a villain! Also having a villain that convenient reflects everything that Larsson considers wrong with Swedish society allows him to push his views, which, for the record, I do find fairly admirable in some respects.All those pages that Larsson could have used to develop more interesting and relatable characters is instead used to pad grocery lists and name-drop products that have no bearing on the story.I really want to like these novels.

The movie was exceptionally good. I was especially drawn in by the characters. Even with sub-titles I became totally lost in the story at 35,000 ft. and 3:00 AM, my time. I had, of course, heard of Stieg Larsson and his three volume ""Millennium"" series. What I wasn't aware of was what a phenomenon the books had become in the U.S. I walked into Powell's and all I could see was yellow, red and silver books, hardcovers, trade PBs and the MM PB all by Stieg Larsson. An aside: how did they manage to price the MM PB at only US$7.99. Even the most banal and boring PBs are now US$9.99. Having just seen the movie, I thought I would start reading the series with the second book. Read the third one and then go back to the first one when the movie had faded a little from my mind (a much shorter process than it used to be).I don't know if I made the right decision but I do know, I sure liked this book. I am perplexed with how an author like Larsson can make a list of items purchased at the 7-11 interesting while James Patterson can make a gruesome murder boring.I won't recap the plot here. That job is done well enough in the description of the book on the Goodreads site. What I want to do is to communicate how well Larsson develops the plot and hooks the reader deeper and deeper into what, on the surface, is an unbelievable tale. By the end of the book, which came far too soon, I had totally suspended my disbelief and was completely caught up in the events as Larsson described them.Lisbeth Salander is a character for the ages, perhaps the Holden Caulfield of the new century. She is unforgettable. Mikael Blomqvist, the journalist at Millennium Magazine, is interesting and the villains are scary enough but without Lisbeth, this would have been just another run of the mill police procedural.I do not recommend starting the series the way I did.

Blomkvist, one-time lover but forever a friend is famous for bringing down a corrupt business man and has time to bring down a few more...Whilst this book was nowhere near as good as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo in terms of plot, intrigue and general crime-thriller-murder-mystery type trope (I'd rate those at probably 2 or 3 / 5), it is still an almighty read. It made me even more angry than the first one did, not that I thought that was possible.Again, it was Lisbeth Salander.

He's passionate about these things and it's obvious in these works. The only other author I've read who has taken such an interest in writing memorable, non-girly, non-stereotypical female characters is the late Sir Terry Pratchett.I'm incredibly intrigued to see the film but I'll need to read the third and final book before I do that: if they so much as make light of any of the feminist issues in the books I doubt I'll watch another Hollywood film again.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy",5,-0.9477,0.131,0.777,0.092,0.4674603174603174,POSITIVE,0.9421

In a discussion of the series with a friend, I was told that Lisbeth is hardly in this book at all, and that my friend was disappointed by that. Now, after finishing it, I can only assume that my friend read a different book than I did. Lisbeth is ALL OVER this book. Every page, every sentence, shows us more and more of her. But as a perspective main character, which I assume is what my friend was talking about, yes, there's much less of her than in Dragon Tattoo. And I liked that. I like the dual perspectives of the mains, and I like knowing little details that they each don't know... but more, I liked, REALLY liked, not knowing whether or not to believe in Lisbeth's guilt. She's fucking unhinged. And more than capable. And has justifiable reason out the wazoo... but did she, or didn't she? I liked not knowing.

The procedural aspect is oddly amateurish. All the reliance on specific models and brands gets clunky over time. Sometimes Larsson seems clumsy in how he sets up the people in the scenes: here's someone conservative reacting badly to or again underestimating this radically attired, tattooed young woman who metes out her own justice as she sees fit, a one-woman vigilante squad who's really messed up but on the side of good. And I guess to tell the story of how good she is against all odds, Larsson figured you have to not only have a bunch of people stand up for you as character witnesses but also you had to spell out the evils that had made her this way. Sometimes reading these scenes I wonder why authors want you to squirm, to test whether you too have rape or torture or humiliation fantasies, or what have you. But then Larsson died before he could watch as his book sold 20 million times over around the world and was made into a film in Sweden, a Hollywood remake close on its heels. I see how this author relies on extreme violence in some of the scenes, but I wonder if there might be other, even more effective ways to show the effects of that kind of violence without giving the violators more screen time.

Fire is smart, fast-paced, and intricate and keeps you guessing until the very last second. Larsson takes on the issue of sex trafficking fearlessly, but perhaps even more admirable than this is the fact that Larsson has a truly remarkable understanding of the threats and insults and aggression women face every day, simply for being women. His portrayal of the common Alpha Male is just as uncompromising as his portrayal of the sex trade. For a woman it's a refreshingly honest thing to read; for a man it should be brutally enlightening. But Larsson does not make the fatal mistake of burying the story under a social crusade. His characters are as vivid and complex as ever. The only thing lacking from the second installment in the trilogy is the electric dynamic of Salander and Blomkvist working together. Instead they weave in and around each other with little direct interaction until the very, very end.

And yet, really, you get the feeling that the bad guys are made to be so ultra creepy that it gives our little Lisbeth license to go out and beat the hell out of them with tasers and guns and knives and other devices.

Questions about Lisbeth Salendar are answered but it is never really explained why the Math quotes precede each book section. She is a very unbelievable character ‚Äì but it is entertaining to pretend that you could buy her brilliance and her cunning strength and ability to get out of incredibly dangerous situations with extreme wealth and with a controlling hold over the villain that continues to provide us with more plot development while also keeping her from sliding into the ranks of a cold hearted murderer (whether they deserved it or not). Anyway ‚Äì I definitely recommend this series and look forward reading the last of the trilogy. ,5,0.9136,0.117,0.681,0.202,0.6566666666666666,POSITIVE,0.9999

Sequel to ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", the late Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" continues the story of the most fascinating heroines to come along in literature in a long time. In this one, Lisbeth Salander is on the run from the law, as she is a suspect in three murders. Michael Blomkvist, her jilted friend/lover, believes her to be innocent, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Salander's torturous childhood is revealed, and without giving too much away, it becomes clear why she has so much animosity toward men in general and especially men in authority. My only complaint (and its not really a complaint) with this book is that it ends with a frickin' cliffhanger! Thankfully, the third book is out now...

Lisbeth Salander, our heroine, will routinely take in a series of facts and then sit at length and just ponder. (In this book, she was also contemplating a mathematical equation in her spare time.) Her organized brain mirrors the logical way Larsson's entire story unfolds. It's rich with detail, but the reader has little trouble keeping up because it's put together so well. His character development is also superb, whether a monster thug who's afraid of the dark, a newspaper editor who's professionally and sexually conflicted, a veteran cop who's dedicated but fatigued by the hurdles of the job, or our friends Salander and Blomkvist, who are so obviously in love that it hurts.

""There are no innocents. There are, however, different degrees of responsibility.""
 
What It's About:
 When Millennium decides to publish an article that will expose a sex trafficking operation, the reporters responsible for the article are murdered. Lisbeth fingerprints are found on the murder weapon and she is on the run. Mikael Blomkvist is convinced that Lisbeth is innocent and determined to seek the truth.
My thoughts:
 MIND BLOWN. I honestly do not know what else to say except this is a MUST READ. The story is set two years after the first book and we learned what happened to our characters after the Vanger/Wennerstrom fiasco in the first book. I really liked that. It felt like catching up with old friends! You'd have to slowly devour this book. It's definitely not a fast-paced one and there are a lot of moving plots in this complex story. It did take time for the main event to occur (perhaps after 30% of the book) but it did not mean the first part serves no purpose. In fact, it added a lot of depth to our characters since there were some backstories on them. And speaking of characters, Lisbeth is such a bad ass in this book! I am so thrilled that there was so much backstory on her in this book! She is definitely one of my all time favourite characters now! As always, the writing was absolutely engaging and the translation was top-notch! It seemed like a Herculean task to put this book down! The twists. Oh my goodness! They were twistier than a pretzel twist and I gasped in complete shock - like what the heck?! Overall, this was a great addition to this Millennium series! It was both a character and plot driven story and I LOVED IT! The ending was so unexpected and it compelled me to read the third and final book now!",4,0.9924,0.052,0.767,0.181,0.5492129629629631,POSITIVE,0.9999
194,343305910,06/06/2012,2.0,"I didn't care for the first novel, and The Girl Who Played with Fire wasn't much better either. I was initially drawn in by the change in setting to the Caribbean, and the attempted murder in the midst of a hurricane. I assumed that the story would follow Lisbeth as she dug into the reasons behind Forbes' attempted murder of his wife, and Lisbeth getting in over her head in some international conspiracy. Then Lisbeth goes back to Sweden, and the entire story on Grenada seems like a red herring. When she gets back to Sweden, the story then seems like it'll be a tale of Lisbeth evading the police after being framed for the murder of Bjurman, as well as a journalist and PhD candidate who were about to blow an international sex-trafficking ring wide open. It seemed as if it would be this fast-paced cross between Angelina Jolie's Salt and The Net, with Lisbeth persecuted for knowing too much. I think that would've made for a much more exciting story than what actually followed, which was a weirdass family history of Lisbeth and her father. In a word, this book was fucking weird. We hear more about Lisbeth's time in institutions, where she continually refers to an event in her life called 'all the evil'. It turns out that the leader of the sex-trafficking ring is randomly her father, a guy who sought refuge in Sweden after escaping from the Soviet Union. He ran an international prostitution ring and used to beat the shit out of Lisbeth's mother. When Lisbeth finally loses it and lights him on fire as a tween, he uses his loyal clients in the Security Police to have her committed to mental institutions. The doctor that oversaw her stay was on the take, ensuring she was treated as poorly as possible during her stay there.We also have this weirdass tale of a blonde giant with an inability to feel pain, who's responsible for cleaning up Zala's (Lisbeth's father) messes. Turns out he's Lisbeth's mutant half brother, and that Zala sired enough children to practically form an army. I really don't understand what Zala's aims were and his connection to Bjurman, but it all comes to a head when Lisbeth confronts him at his house in the sticks. Lisbeth is shot in the face, back and hip, and buried alive by her hulk brother. Somehow she manages to dig her way out, attack Zala and her mutant sibling and take refuge in the house, where she's found by Blomkvist. The novel draws to an end there. Like I said, this book was weird. I no doubt missed some things as I was listening to an audiobook while on my walks to work and around the city, but there's no doubt that the book featured some poor writing too. This book would've benefited indefinitely if Larsson had kept it simple; either go with investigating Forbes, or keep it to a 'she knew too much' sex-trafficking story. Adding in all the stuff about Zala being Lisbeth's father and her mutant half brother just served to complicate things. I had no idea where the story was going, and not in a good way like with James Dashner's The Maze Runner.That being said, I'm glad we finally understand how Lisbeth came to be declared incompetent and locked away in various institutions. When I read Dragon Tattoo I just couldn't comprehend how they justified locking away a 12 year old and putting her under guardianship. I put it down to the Swedish welfare system being really frakking strange, although that explanation didn't satisfy me. Now I know there's a lot more to the story, and I don't entirely want to throttle Lisbeth for being socially inept and refusing to speak to the authorities. Now I said I didn't entirely want to throttle her. I feel more sympathy for Lisbeth than I did while reading Dragon Tattoo, but I still feel like she goes out of her way to act difficult and obnoxious at times. Perhaps the best example is when Blomkvist is communicating with her via Microsoft Word. He repeatedly asks her to explain what happened, but Lisbeth can't be bothered to come off her fucking high horse and string together a sentence, instead giving him a bunch of stupid fucking cryptic clues. Blomkvist expresses his frustration at how difficult she's being, but she thinks he's being amusing in trying to play off her emotions. While I now understand Lisbeth's backstory, I still think she's a royal fucking twat. *throttles her* I also had to roll my eyes during the whole boobjob story at the start of the novel. Now, I'm not against flawed insecure protagonists. I loved Melissa Glasser at the start of The Secret Circle TV series, where she felt used and abused by Faye and Nick. She was a wonderfully human and realistic character, and I wanted to give her a big hug. Not the case with Salander. She dresses like a tryhard douche and acts abrasive, but on the inside she's just pathetically whiny and insecure. Her self-loathing is so severe that she just irritates me. Even when she's about to make ~sexytime with Miriam, she whines some more about being insecure about her boobs. Overall: I'm going to keep going and read the final instalment of the series, but I have very low expectations of it at this point. It's hard to feel enthusiasm for a series when you constantly want to punch the protagonist in the face. I continue to disagree with my friends' assertions that Lisbeth is a fantastic strong female lead. She's too flawed for my liking. It's also incredibly hard to feel enthusiasm for a series when the author seems dead set on making the story as convoluted as possible. *sigh*",4,-0.9564,0.13,0.758,0.112,0.4857398284984491,NEGATIVE,0.9993

196,3040836099,11/17/2019,4.0,"Things Start to Get Real16 November 2019 ‚Äì Bendigo	Well, after having read the first book, and becoming severely engrossed in it, and also having a friend who is incredibly critical when it comes to books, particularly books that tend to be pretty mainstream, come out and rave about who much he loved it (and as it turned out, I was the one who gave him the book, namely because I had already read it). Anyway, after having finished that book, I just had the urge to read the next one. Well, that is now done, and with the way that the book ended, well, it feels as if you have no choice but to read the third.	One of the things that I discovered as I was reading this book was that Larson actually died prior to seeing any of these books in print. I knew that he had died, but I didn‚Äôt realise that these books were published posthumously. That pretty much means that he never was able to see how much of a roaring success these books had become. Yet, in a way, it seems to be the tragedy of the artist that in many cases it isn‚Äôt until they die that they actually become famous. On the other hand, it could be that his death, like that of Van Gogh, was the catalyst for his works to hit the mainstream, and honestly, yeah, these books were a roaring success.	This book sort of begins after the events on the previous book, and it is certainly the case that you pretty much need to have known what had been going on there to understand, and appreciate, what is going on in this book. However, one thing that I should point out is that for the first third of the book, Larson pretty much seems to be setting the scene, and you sort of wander what is actually going on, and where the book is going. Then, all of a sudden, it pretty much hits you like a steam train, and the story literally takes off from there. Mind you, when you reach the end, it is sort of a conclusion, but it isn‚Äôt. Yeah, you could leave it at that, but you know that there is a sequel, and you can pretty much tell that yeah, it sort of has come to a conclusion, but there really isn‚Äôt that satisfying, yes, this is the end of the book, sort of feel about it.	You may get the impression that I am being somewhat vague, and that is because I really don‚Äôt want to give too much away about what goes on here, namely because it does happen to be a mystery. Mind you, I suspect that most of the people that end up reading this review have probably already read the book, and those people who are reading the review to determine whether they should read it or not, well, I simply point them to the star rating at the top. Mind you, it hasn‚Äôt stopped me in the past from writing reviews where I simply ramble on about nothing, and end up having a horde of trolls descent upon me because, well, in their view, that is not how I am supposed to write a review (though I sometimes wander how many trolls the truly popular reviewers have to fend off at times, namely because my reviews tend to be tame compared to some that are out there).	Anyway, one of the things that I noticed as I read this book is that Larson seems to think that there are some seriously sick people out there, and honestly, he would be right about that. Look, there are so many coverups and that, that we really don‚Äôt know (and probably don‚Äôt want to know) what some people get up to. Honestly, take Epstein for example. The thing is that I suspect that a lot of the people in power who, like Epstein, are probably protected in someway, yet I also suspect that if you upset the wrong people, then suddenly all of your dirty laundry is aired out for everybody to see ‚Äì look how quickly Mardoff went from hero to zero. 	Mind you, there are even some leaders that will proudly make outrageous statements, and there are a few of them out there, knowing full well that they can do it and pretty much get away with that. Like, there is that joke that goes along the lines of: how do you know that a politician is lying ‚Äì his lips are moving. It‚Äôs like it is pretty much accepted that politicians are crooks, and we simply work on the principle that, well, there is nothing that we can do about it, so we just keep on voting the same lot back in ‚Äì mind you, the ballot box is a powerful weapon that is used by those who are successful at the other end.	Anyway, I have probably drifted quite a way off now, but the thing is that this book is about some very powerful people, who have a lot of dirty laundry to air out. However, the other thing is that this book sort of explains a lot of things that we found out about in the first book. In the first book, it sort of seemed as if, well, Lisbeth had just drawn quite a few short straws in her life, namely because she had found herself declared mentally incompetent, and had found herself in the hands of some truly sick people. However, it turns out that, well, there was a lot more going on behind the scenes, and because, not surprisingly, Lisbeth pretty much keeps to herself, a lot of other things eventually had to happen for the other characters, and us as well, to find out the truth as to what was really going on. Yeah, it sort of leaves you stunned somewhat, and it is pretty clear that there is even more to come.",4,0.9985,0.078,0.753,0.168,0.5012672811059907,POSITIVE,0.8166

204,94629765,03/18/2010,5.0,"I won‚Äôt do a full synopsis of this, insofar as others have done so repeatedly and well on Goodreads. Lisbeth Salander is one of the most fascinating characters ever conceived. She is brilliant, flawed and an underdog who is impossible not to like. My husband and I listened to this on CD and I had a sneaking suspicion that he was falling in love with Lisbeth. On the other hand, I developed a bit of a crush on Mikael Blomqvist as well ‚Äì reservations only on the ‚Äúlack of commitment‚Äù trait.One does not need to read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in order to enjoy this second installment of the Millennium trilogy. I had and Brian had not; I did find that my reading of the first volume did inform the second. But Larsson managed to fill in nicely without being redundant.So in this second part of the trilogy, we learn more about Lisbeth. Larsson exposes bits and pieces of her background until a full picture emerges. Lisbeth is an everyperson character who Larsson uses to demonstrate how the ineptitude and corruption of a political system works to destroy the common citizen. Unlike most common citizens who accept injustice, Lisbeth will have none of it, and she fights back. More than once we both were cheering: ‚ÄúWay to go Lisbeth!‚ÄùLarsson takes on a great many topics in addition to violence against women in this book: abuse of authority, police corruption, the sex trade, the capitalist media, media ‚Äúethics‚Äù and corruption at every level of political and civil authority.I really found the fact that there is no interaction (save on the internet) between Lisbeth and Mikael until the very end, to be interesting and a bold move against what readers might expect from a conventional relationship story. Way to go Larsson! It is a shame that he died so young. This man was truly a gifted writer who knew how to use words ‚Äì many of themPeople have opined that his books are too long. I am usually the first to jump all over editors for not paring down unnecessary verbiage, and I disagree. Each twist, turn, description, musing, moves this story forward and explores both the good and the evil in Sweden ‚Äì which for Larsson may have served as an ‚Äúevery country‚Äù of capitalist society. I would not change a thing. It is clear where Larsson is coming from in his criticism of late capitalist institutions, but not once did I feel that I was being lectured. In fact, I recognized many of the same flawed traits in Sweden as he describes it as I see in the contemporary U.S. This is skillful social commentary, and we should be thinking about the kinds of institutions that we allow to flourish. I think that these books are a kind of call to arms and a statement that we can do better.As far as the CDs and reading ‚Äì it was very, very well done. Simon Vance is masterful and he brought the characters to life. It never ceases to amaze me as to how these professional readers/actors can change their voice and intonations slightly and voila one immediately knows which character is speaking.If I have any criticism of this book, it is that Larsson overstepped his expertise a bit. Although I am a mathematical idiot, my husband mumbled something about his getting some issue about Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem incorrect. Damned if I can explain what and who cares anyway?! Now, when it comes to Asperger‚Äôs I am not an idiot; it‚Äôs one of my clinical specialties. I am not at all convinced that Lisbeth has Asperger‚Äôs ‚Äì perhaps something on the autism spectrum but not Asperger‚Äôs. But again, who cares? This is one hell of a good read, as was the first.

Larsson weaves a suspenseful story chock full of conspiracy theories involving Russian spies, the Swedish secret police, a dark mystery involving ""The Girl's"" past, lesbian S&M ""dykes,"" international prostitution rings, sadistic pedophiles, people who survive attacks against all odds (including digging themselves out of graves after being shot 3 times, once in the skull)... no question, the tale is intriguing, and even at over 1000 pages (on a tablet), there's no boredom for the reader, who is moved quickly along to the next action scene. It's all a bit preposterous, obviously, yet in fulfilling more than its quota of shock value/scandal, misunderstood brilliant heroine fighting the system, governmental conspiracy and injustice at the hands of the defenseless, there's something here to satisfy anyone in the mood for an improbable, outrageous, scandalous (and thus, satisfying on many basal levels) ""fiction"" getaway.This book is no work of literature; yet strangely, it is not quite ""pulp"" either, in the vein of Stephen King and the like. It's difficult to be accurate about the Swedish version only having read the English translation, but even the translator cannot have entirely changed the style/tone. Basically, Larsson writes as a technical writer: he remains detached, preferring to give facts to impressions, and often, to an annoying degree (there are lengthy passages, for example, when he describes Salander's trip to a grocery store or to Ikea, listing for sentences the exact items she brought.. the idea is he is presenting us with information to make up our own minds as to the atmosphere created in her new apartment from the list of objects; he does this over and over: instead of presenting a mood, he lists items and attempts to ""objectively"" describe things and people). This technical style is hard to swallow in a NOVEL, however (I didn't sign up for reading a police report), and contributes to the story's detached and unreal (preposterous) feel.As to the mathematics, well. There we come to the lowest of low points for this life long lover of mathematics. Part I starts with a neat fact about how ""equations are classified by the highest power (value of exponent)"". This is BS: these are POLYNOMIAL equations (of various degrees, but leaving out polynomial is naive because the point is there are many different classes of equations), but more importantly, it's not the equation which is so important in math, it's Functions and theorems available for their analysis. It's quite annoying when a layman presents math as if it's some kind of Rubix cube puzzle, it's like a kid thinking math is about arithmetic, when in fact it's about theorizing in abstract ways about GENERAL patterns (of which numbers and real # algebra are only ONE specific example). Then, of course, there's Salander supposedly solving Fermat's theorem in a split second on the night she digs herself out of a grave after having been left for dead: no explanation, no pen or paper, it just comes to her, and in one sentence, we're supposed to believe that someone with no mathematical training and no obvious understanding of mathematics somehow came up with the proof in her head. Again, like the rest of the book, a bit preposterous.Overall, I give this 4 stars, with weight most heavily placed on the crazy story, which despite (or because of) its insanity, absolutely had me hooked...",4,-0.9666,0.125,0.799,0.077,0.5206937799043061,NEGATIVE,0.8461
208,1898238847,02/15/2017,2.0,"Something like 7 or 8 years ago, I read the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for my book club, and as I recall, I was pretty much the only one that truly hated it. But, just as whenever I start a book I feel compelled to finish it, so too when I start a series I feel like I should push through. So I waited these many years, but finally the little voice telling me I must finish has pushed me to read the next book in the Millennium series, the Girl Who Played with Fire.The good news: it is marginally better than Dragon Tattoo. The bad: it is still not very good.It's hard to know for certain whether it is Larsson's original prose or the translation of it, but there is no artistry in these genre novels. They are flat and plodding without any sense of tension. The pacing drags from page to page with endless descriptions of mundane details, and there is little evocative imagery.I mentioned, however, that this is slightly improved on the original, and here is how: (at least in my memory) the original treated our main characters Michael and Lisbeth as heroes. They were white knights saving the day. GWPWF is a little more cagey and self-aware on this point. Michael is portrayed as more self-obsessed and indulgent. Lisbeth is more freely depicted as a genuine sociopath who is entirely unwilling to consider the effects of her actions on others. Larsson at one point sort of half-assedly throws out there at perhaps Lisbeth has autism or Asperger's, which is deeply unfair of him to do to people who are actually on the spectrum. As ever, Lisbeth is endowed as if by magic with world class hacker skillz and her lifestyle is I guess supposed to be titillating to readers and she is able to routinely defeat large, well-trained men in combat. And she's also fabulously rich, too. Always easy to identify with characters when they have unimaginable wealth. She also got breast implants and Larsson tells us about it at length. Why?She also literally solves the hardest math problems ever invented by mathematicians in her spare time. This is the laziest crutch imaginable for a writer trying to demonstrate intelligence in a character. He might as well have made her offhandedly discover a unifying theory of Newtonian and quantum physics. Remember the dude she casually kills on the beach in the hurricane at the beginning of the book? That whole episode is dropped and never mentioned again. How about Berger's momentous decision about whether to take the job at the rival newspaper that is totally forgotten for hundreds of pages at at time? There's lots of stuff like that in this book.Supporting characters are almost without exception silly stereotypes (Paulo!) and straw men (Faste!). The conclusion is as exciting as any dumb action movie of the kind you have seen 100 times. Friends, I'm out of step with the lovers of these books. I. do. not. get. it. Yet, there are many in the world that do love them. 65 million sold, according to the back of my copy. Many of the people that love them are even people that I respect and whose judgment I often agree with. Nonetheless, here is my full-throated dissent. These are bad books, and I am right about it.

209,109448665,06/30/2010,3.0,"after the first one, this book feels a bit of a let down. i get that this is a middle installation in a trilogy so that a considerable amount of the book has to ""set up"" the final, i really do. if the first was meant to serve as an introduction of the major players, here we get the ""why""...there's a lot of info dealt out, some of it necessary, some of it not.the golden egg:1. the second half of the book is MUCH better than the first. once there's an actual murder to solve and blomkvist gets in his journalistic groove, the book actually gets its legs. you just have to read 250 pages in to get to the really good stuff.2. lisbeth - she's interesting. while i take some mild offense that larsson requires his heroine to be bogged down with a traumatic past and a possible idiot-savant-esque relationship with math, she's compelling enough to help drive the series. 3. i want to read the third one. yes, this one is uneven and far more imperfect than the first, but lisbeth's story needs a worthy conclusion and i want to see larsson give it to her.5. mimmi and the boxer - hands down, best part of the book. totally ludicrous, yes, but also just really entertaining.the gratuitous smut:1. berger - the five pages or so that larsson dedicated to berger pondering exactly how good blomkvist is in bed, i wish i had back. i'm sure her decision to leave millenium will be important in the final installment, but here it just felt like ugly filler. it didn't fit her character and it didn't fit her relationship with micke. 2. lisbeth's travels - we get this lengthy story about lisbeth's trip to the tropics and how she gets caught in a storm and saves a woman from a husband that wants to kill her. now, surely something from this part would be crucial later on, yes? no. it's just another example of how lisbeth hates men who hate women and, quite frankly, if you couldn't get that from the first book (or from the sheer number of times it gets mentioned in the novel itself), you don't deserve to read these.3. sex,sex,sex. i get that the plot centers around trafficking and that it's going to ""come up"" (no pun intended)- but really, who knew the swedes were so dirty??? and i love lisbeth and i'm all for bisexuality, but when a man whose fictional-self is the most sexed up journalist in sweden writes about two women having sex it just feels wrong to me. really wrong. btw, who hasn't blomkvist slept with? i'm surprised he didn't turn mimmi by the end of this one!4. ikea and apple - did larsson get money from these people? apparently, when you become a millionaire in sweden, you go to IKEA and you buy all your furniture there. funny, that's not how it works in america. also, i'm a PC girl. i appreciate lisbeth's attachment to her computer, but i don't need it thrown in my face how her computer is the superior model. seriously, i get that her wee mac is capable of hacking into all of sweden's top information portals but damn.see you after the third.",4,0.9854,0.093,0.756,0.152,0.5102693602693602,NEGATIVE,0.9999
210,67849578,08/18/2009,4.0,"A reluctant four stars -- it was definitely a successful pageturner, and I don't think it's fair to penalize it for being anticlimactic for me after its predecessor. But I do have some nitpicky gripes.This follow-up to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" develops Lisbeth Salander more, revealing some of the mysteries of her past as they come back to haunt her. The book begins to take off when circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that Lisbeth murdered her guardian, Nils Bjurman (the one who raped her in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") as well as a couple working on an article and book exposing the sex trade in Sweden, to be published by Blomkvist's edgy magazine, ""Millennium."" Blomkvist is one of Lisbeth's only defenders, but she refuses to be in contact with him which makes it difficult for him to help her. The book follows Salander as she engages in a cat-and-mouse chase with the real villains, and Blomkvist and the police (working separately) as they try to locate Salander.Although Larsson has once again written a book that's easy to pick up and hard to put down, I found this premise less interesting than that of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" With ""Dragon Tattoo,"" I was taken with the whole idea of downtrodden Blomkvist and whether he would end up redeeming himself, not to mention the intrigue behind Harriet Vanger's disappearance and the whole dysfunctional Vanger clan. ""Played with Fire,"" on the other hand, seemed more like a typical murder mystery with a plot that's been done many times before. There were also some cheap gimmicks that got on my nerves. More so than in ""Dragon Tattoo,"" I found it hard to suspend my disbelief as Salander in her infinite brilliance continually outsmarted the bumbling police team with a series of highly creative and improbable tactics. Also, some things were too predictable and obvious, convenient coincidences of the right people being at the same place at the same time even when that sometimes seemed unlikely or random. Finally, like ""Dragon Tattoo"" this book had more than its fair share of graphic torture scenes but here I also felt there was way too much information on people‚Äôs bizarre sexual proclivities, something which I think figured less prominently in ""Dragon Tattoo."" With all that, ""Played with Fire"" was still quite readable and hard to put down. While I'm pretty sure some of my criticism simply results from finding the book anticlimactic after ‚ÄúThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,‚Äù on the other hand, I‚Äôm not sure I would have enjoyed this as much without the background from the first book; I don‚Äôt know whether this would work as a stand-alone story. So my final recommendation is, if you read and liked ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" by all means read this, if only to learn more about Salander and see what happens next.

211,288704030,03/04/2012,3.0,"I gave The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 4 stars. I'm dropping this one to 3, but only barely. I've been criticized by some here for 3 star ratings, but sometimes it's all you can do. I'd say this is another of the 3.5 we discuss. It's a very good 3 and I like the book and can even, with a few reservations recommend it. But it's not quite as good as the first one.Don't get me wrong. The characters are still excellent and the plot is interesting and absorbing. The book simply manages to get a bit side tracked now and then and this (I think) detracts from the novel a bit.I put off reviewing the book for a few days after I finished it and I find it didn't really ""stay with me"" as the first volume of this series did. I'll list a few of the ""side tracks"" later, under a spoiler tag. For now let me say that other than the ""wandering"" we get a good novel.Here we're going to learn much more about Salander, her life and her background. She's still a maddening character (which she's meant to be) and still an oddly sympathetic one. The way the book ties up is one of those ""non-ending endings"" that leaves no doubt that there's more for us to learn and more to come. This does give me pause about the next book (though I've already reserved it) as it's the last in the series Larsson wrote before his death. As I understand it, he intended 10 volumes.So, in spite of the mid-range rating (which is one I'm not really satisfied with but have settled on as a compromise) I can mostly recommend this one and like it.(view spoiler)[ We do get a lot of background for Salander here and we get a lot more about the lives of the other characters. Sometimes I felt like it started to take over the book just a bit. The relationship withing the magazine and all the people running it. The interpersonal relationships here tended to get a bit like food coloring spilled into water. They simply dispersed throughout the book. Sometimes this is helpful other times it wasn't really related to the book and I wasn't all that interested.I realize however others will like that part of the book better than I. I also had to shake my head a bit at the ""nonstandard relationships"". Of course in Sweden the relationships may not be as nonstandard as they would be here. I must say however that I've never really known an open marriage (except in books or movies) where the wife calls up her husband and says ""oh, by the way I'm spending the night with my lover"". And he says ""all right have fun"". Here we have 2 marriages like this.Just a little, unusual I think...could be just me. I mean why bother with the marriage? Oh well.But as I said as far as characterization and plot, a good book.  (hide spoiler)]",4,0.9922,0.058,0.809,0.133,0.4908739837398373,NEGATIVE,0.9998

And do you remember how the great Lisbeth Salander got her revenge to that old-jerk in the ""Girl with the dragon tattoo""? (Here's a flashback: The old-jerk's name is Erik Bjurman and I remembered how he was humiliated so hard that I even burst out laughing! CLUE: I AM A SADISTIC PIG. A PERVERT AND A RAPIST) And now the old-guy Erik Bjurman wants to take his pride back and have his revenge to Lisbeth. Actually, I had message for that so-called advokat: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she‚Äôll get a bigger gun.‚Äù and one more thing, if he really hates his life because of the humiliation Lisbeth Salander had done to him? Then I'm not going to stop him risking his luck in ruining Salander's life, rather I will want him have his fight because in the end, I know he will lose. He will lose bad. hoho! [Ooops, I loose strings back there but did I mention that that was the novel's plot? ;p)Lisbeth is back in action.

Note: I would like to remind my fellow goodreaders that I am STRAIGHT, okay? hahaha!) plus, the novel adds how Lisbeth's sad background affected her personality and physical appearance. It certainly amazed me on how the novel shows the way our protagonist Lisbeth begins to appreciate friendships and relationships more than ever.Last but not the least, this story shows that when you try and expose the truth and nothing else, it would be the most powerful thing in the world that even people who are hideously bad won't give a reason to oppose with it.

214,99113448,04/18/2010,1.0,"I hated THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I thought it was a boring, cliche-ridden, bloated mess. The Lisbeth Salander character was, by far, the best thing about it...unfortunately, the story centered primarily on Michael Blomkvist, a thinly disguised, idealized version of the author himself and the magazine he founded. It's an awful book. The only reason I read the sequel, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, is because so many people told me it was a much better book than TATTOO...and that it would make me understand the phenomenon. To some degree, they are right. The first third of the book is centered on Salander and her adventures abroad and back in Sweden...which actually are a lot of fun to read, if you can get past all the cliches (more on that in a minute). Salander is a great character that's stuck, unfortunately, in two lousy novels. The instant Michael Blomkvist returns, and even before he takes the spotlight, the book becomes overwhelmed with dull exposition (which is repeated endlessly, telling you the same facts over and over and over again), ridiculous coincidences, and pointless scenes that neither move the story forward nor reveal character. The characters become so thin that calling them ""cardboard"" would be giving them more substance and depth than they actually have. As if this wasn't punishment enough for the reader, the cliche-count radically increases as the book slogs on until it seems like there's one in every paragraph. Here are just a few of them: ""Nutty as a fruitcake"" ""Go jump in a lake."" ""he's pulling my leg."" ""too many irons in the fire."" ""out like a light."" ""keep it under our hats."" ""like a hot potato."" ""you're clutching at straws."" ""afraid he'd spill the beans."" ""the penny dropped."" ""she's a loose cannon."" ""cool as a cucumber."" ""fight tooth and nail."" ""kept her nose clean."" ""fly in the ointment"" And so it goes, on and on, one dusty old cliche after another. By far the most used cliche in the book is ""Hung out to dry/hang out to dry."" It was used a dozen times before I gave up counting. I doubt these are Swedish cliches, so I blame the translator for being a lazy hack...and his editor for not doing his job.

215,64046482,07/18/2009,5.0,"This second installment in the Millenium series is just as fast-paced as the first. Lisbeth Salander is one of the most interesting characters I have read in a long time but, that said, I have some frustrations that carry over from the first book.I have a hard time being patient with her. She is angry with Blomkvist, I get it. But, once she finds out he is still an ally, why doesn't she give him more information? I get angry when more disclosure between people could just elimate a large portion of the book. It was really annoying to me that she emailed him ""Zala"" but didn't explain anything to him. She is like, ""you're the journalist, figure it out."" WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT WHEN YOU ALREADY KNOW AND COULD JUST TELL HIM? P.S. you are a suspect in three murders, it might behoove you to give a little info up to help your cause.I was pretty bored with Berger's story about moving to the Morning Post.

I definitely enjoyed it more than the first one. The whole Harriet Vanger storyline in the first book was completely self-serving and had nothing to do with the trilogy (specifically). The connections and elaborations to things introduced in the first book were amazing. Everything about Salander ties together in this one, and I can totally see why the trilogy focuses on her specifically. The first book was more shared by she and Blomkqvist, but this one was all about her (and I was glad because she is must more a dynamic and interesting character). It's hard to talk about the book in this review without giving anything away, which I don't want to for even the few people that may come across this. But do yourselves a favor and read it - all the hype and mega-book-sales are well worth checking it out. It is most definitely not your typical mystery novel, and has an intensely intriguing storyline but is only able to do so because of its fascinating characters. Especially after reading this one, I am proposing a conspiracy theory on the death of Stieg Larsson, the author. In this book, two journalists are killed because they are planning to reveal evidence on all sorts of people from all facets of life (cops, doctors, policitians, etc) tying them to the sex-trafficking and illegal arms trade. I feel like this trilogy was Larsson's way of presenting what he knows of the real Sweden's similar issues, and he was KILLED BECAUSE OF IT!

His opinion on certain matters (feminism, law, justice, etc.) based on this book, is very strong and thought through. Thank you for Salander. Thank you for Blomkvist. I enjoyed reading the first book and that one was very captivating and compelling, but this part of the series had me hooked even more. Mainly because -FINALLY- we get to read more Salander. YES Larsson, you get it, everybody wants more Salander! I feel like Salander is one of the most complex and interesting characters I've ever read about and even though she's odd, she's still reliable. - Okay, she is not perfect. Far from it. Some of her actions are extreme. But she has every reason, and she has problems, but she does have morals. Her actions may not be accepted by the law, but when put in context, they're justified.From Larsson's writing it's pretty obvious that he was a journalist himself. And I wasn't surprised when I found out he used to be an activist a well. Not just the characters, the theme was a big reason why this mystery thriller was so attracting to me. There is a whole lot about justice and feminism, in forms of illegal sex trade etcetera. Violence against women is a great deal in these books. We can see that those were important subjects that Larsson wanted to share with us. The plot is amazing. I was surprised by the outcome even through I tried to put the pieces together as well.

Back in Sweden Blomquist is working with a young journalist and his wife to publish a book and series of articles in his magazine, Millenium, about the Swedish sex industry. This will cause problems for many people; police, politicians, etc. Lisbeth returns to Sweden to make contact with people that she left behind on her departure and also to check up on the lawyer, Bjurman, who had abused her when she was a young teenager and who she holds under her thumb now. Her return will instigate a series of events, murders that will threaten Lisbeth's life and those of her friends. The story is told very matter-of-factly but holds your interest. So many people involved in the investigation of the murders; for which Lisbeth is the main suspect. The police include some who hate Lisbeth and want to bring her down, others with more open minds. You will reconnect with Armansky, her old boss who wants to try and help her. As well, Blomquist who trusts her implicitly, also works to solve the murders and proves Lisbeth's innocence. Of course, you also have Lisbeth, such an innocent character, smart, troubled, independent; such a neat character. There are some nice surprises in this second story and an exciting ending. I will have to get the third book and see what else Lisbeth becomes involved with. It's a long story, but doesn't seem long. 4 stars",4,0.9032,0.097,0.77,0.133,0.4054308390022675,POSITIVE,0.997
220,68049288,08/19/2009,2.0,"No where near the caliber of the first book in the series ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was waiting so long for this one to come out and was bitterly disappointed. Not that it was a ""bad"" book per se, it just needed more action and A LOT more editing. The plot just plodded tirelessly through and many of the descriptions (I'd say about 200 pages worth) were unnecessary as they added nothing to the plot and really slowed down the pace. The main story almost got lost in the midst of every other minute thing that the author describes in great detail which is sad as this book solely focused on one of the most interesting characters (Lisabeth Sanders) I've come across. What I enjoyed about the novel were the details of Lisbeth's life. We go deeper into the lives of many other secondary characters as well. The reader discovers exactly what happens when ""all the evil"" occurs and many loose ends/characters are connected and tied up from the first novel. There are a few unpredictable plot twists as well. Despite of all this, I was ready for the book to end after about 350 pages. It is a must-read for those who read and enjoyed the first book and the series should be read in order. Many of the plot lines were left hanging so I will be waiting to read the third installment of this trilogy ""The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" just to see what Larsson does with all of these characters.

A couple writing a thesis and book respectively which exposes powerful people across political and police professions of their involvement in illegal sex trafficking and using/abusing underage prostitutes are found dead, the murder weapon seemingly discarded nearby with Lisbeth's prints all over it. Shortly after the macabre discovery, there's another murder, Lisbeth's guardian and former abuser is found gunned down. Three murders all linked to Lisbeth; the police have their chief suspect. However, head of Millennium, Mikael Blomkvist knows Lisbeth is innocent and sets out to complete the work of the murdered couple, hoping to find evidence along the way which will clear Lisbeth's name and bring her out from hiding. Author Stieg Larsson explores Lisbeth's childhood and teen years prior to the earlier novel which provided a greater insight into a very unique and interesting character. The past events link to the current day setting beautifully, giving the story more depth than it had on face value. The book also takes into account what transpired in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo for added plot devises and context to the murder investigations - this was well written and provided a nice sense of continuity to the Millennium series.

(Not done because the MSs were basically posthumous??)I generously gave the first book 3 stars, even after suffering through the long, overly detailed, downright tedious plot set-up. Not enough patience for this one. The reviews say it starts with the murder of a couple of reporters investigating sex trafficking. Well, there‚Äôs a titillating prologue hinting at sexual torture/slavery, but that quickly changes to a long, boring description of the heroine in the tropics, complete with her new breast augmentation, and no hint of the murder before I gave up. And the heroine, The Girl Who/With, belongs in a Superhero comic strip: a tiny waif (but capable of inflicting serious physical injury on big, bad guys) with nearly superhuman brain power focused on world class computer hacking. Her rage and antisocial behaviors are fueled by being the victim of sexual and other abuse (and maybe more detail is forthcoming beyond where I read), and her vacation is being financed by blackmail of a perpetrator (that‚Äôs OK in comics, our fantasies, and very occasionally in real life, where 2 wrongs can make a right and vigilante justice is much tidier than the Legal system). And when early on she seduces (the brief description sounds more like date-rape) an underage guy, there‚Äôs no hint of irony. A good editor might make this a taut 4 hr read, or a good scriptwriter might make it an exciting 2 hr movie. But there are plenty of plot driven thrillers out there, and I‚Äôd rather spend my time on something better than this. ",4,0.5266,0.152,0.685,0.163,0.4878509585652443,NEGATIVE,1.0

The details of daily live and the background details of the characers (even the villains) make this a story with such depth. I am usually not surprised to find out the twist and turns in a thriller/mystery, but the solving of the puzzle surprised me. It was not what I expected. Some downsides, while reading this book, I often wondered - how much coffee can a person drink? It is a wonder that Lisbeth and Mikhail were ever able to sleep.

Most of my reviews are romance novels, but this series is not. I only mention it so that other romance lovers might consider it.THE TRILOGY:STORY BRIEF:The three books must be read in order. This is a hugely popular best-selling mystery suspense thriller about a few members of the Swedish national police organization forming a ‚Äúspecial section‚Äù doing illegal things. To shut up a 12-year-old witness, they have her placed in a mental institution. Her name is Lisbeth Salander. Mikhail Blomkvist is an investigative journalist. In book 1, Salander who is now 24 helps Blomkvist solve a mystery about a woman who disappeared. In books 2 and 3, Salander has a variety of problems resulting from ‚Äúspecial section‚Äù activities. A number of interesting characters are involved. Some are helpful and others try to hurt Salander.THE THREE BOOKS IN ORDER ARE:The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Swedish Title: Men Who Hate Women)The Girl Who Played With Fire (Swedish Title: same)The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet‚Äôs Nest (Swedish Title: The Air Castle Blows Up) The Air Castle in Swedish means a complex structure based on nothing.REVIEWER‚ÄôS OPINION OF ALL THREE BOOKS:I want happy endings when I read books, and I was definitely satisfied and happy at the ends of books 1 and 3. I know I will continue to think about Salander and this story well into the future. Book 1 can be read as a stand-alone, but I wanted more Salander so I bought book 2. Book 2 stops in the middle of the story which is ok as long as you get book 3 to keep reading right away. I loved the three books. This is not a predictable, run-of-the-mill mystery thriller. There are a wide range of characters and plot intricacies that are wonderfully well done. I was so taken with these books that I bought the audio versions AND the paper versions for books 2 and 3. I‚Äôve never done that before. That way I could continue with the story when I was driving and doing kitchen work. I would switch to the hard copy when sitting.In the first book, Salander felt like a modern day replacement for Sherlock Holmes, but very different. They both are brilliant in their special skills, and draw my admiration. However, Salander is gritty, edgy, and anti-authority. She despises the police and refuses to allow them to have information about anything. There was a lot of action with Salander in the last half of the first book. I loved reading about her. I was hoping to see a lot of action with Salander in books 2 and 3 ‚Äì seeing her solve other mysteries and doing damage to bad guys. But that didn‚Äôt happen. Books 2 and 3 are more about other characters doing things ‚Äì murders, cover-ups, and investigating ‚Äì but it was all surrounding and relating to Salander. She had less action than I wanted in the last two books. But still, I fully enjoyed books 2 and 3.The English-language film of the first book will be in theaters in 2011. Daniel Craig will play journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Unfortunately, as with most movies, there‚Äôs no way it will be as rich as the books.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Steig Larsson wrote these three books, submitted them to a publisher, and then died before they were published. He had written half of a fourth book which I believe his girlfriend may be finishing. He had an outline and planned to write several more in the series. I am sad for the loss of the author and for the loss of his further writing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW OF BOOK 2: THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE.REVIEWER‚ÄôS OPINION:Book 2 is not complete. The bad guys in book 2 are not satisfactorily dealt with until book 3. I wish that Salander had a bigger role in books 2 and 3. In these books, the majority of time is spent with other people: the police, the investigators, and various bad guys. Salander is the reason people are doing what they‚Äôre doing, but I wanted more Salander action. Still, it was a great reading experience. The Dallas Morning News said ‚ÄúYou might as well give up on the idea of sleep till you‚Äôve finished the book.‚Äù I felt that way. I woke up a few times one night worrying about things in the book. The author has great plot development, conflicts, and characters. But the most unique and unforgettable of these is the character Salander.STORY BRIEF:Two journalists working on sex trafficking are murdered. Salander‚Äôs evil guardian Bjurman is also murdered. Circumstantial evidence points to Salander. A countrywide search is on for her by the police, the bad guys, and Blomkvist. She worked with Blomkvist in book 1 and saved his life. Now she is refusing to have contact with him, and he doesn‚Äôt know why.MORE REVIEWER‚ÄôS OPINION:When I first heard that Salander was the main suspect in the murders, I was hesitant. I usually don‚Äôt enjoy plots where someone is framed or is on the run from the police (think ‚ÄúThe Fugitive,‚Äù Dr. Richard Kimble, 1960s TV and 1993 movie). I was relieved to see that Salander‚Äôs role in this book was NOT the frightened victim. She was in control of her life (much more than I expected) and continued with her own research and actions regarding the bad guys. I enjoyed how she outwitted and thwarted danger and caused damage to others. However, she was not infallible.DATA:Story length: 628 pages. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual content: maybe 3 scenes including rape and lesbian action ‚Äì limited sexual language. Setting: current day mostly Sweden with some time in the Caribbean. Copyright: 2006. Genre: mystery suspense thriller.",3,0.9316,0.135,0.716,0.15,0.5096720116618078,POSITIVE,0.9958

Unfortunately, while she was gone, some of her enemies have been planning on her return. Lisbeth ends up the key suspect in a series of murders. The connection between her and two of the victims does not make any sense to Blomkvist who was working with the two reporters to publish a story on sex trafficking. He and the rest of her friends try to prove her innocence by digging deeply into her past. What they uncover is a bit shocking and could have nation-wide implications.Damn this was a good sequel to the first book! It was clear after book one that Lisbeth‚Äôs past was dark. Now we get the full story and it begins to explain some of her idiosyncrasies, filling out her character. I find her fascinating and am sad that it has taken me so long to pick this series back up. It is funny; so much feels resolved at the end of this book, yet that is not true. We know so much more about Lisbeth and there is a clear path for certain things to happen, but there is also a lot of uncertainty about how our two MCs will act toward each other going forward. I think we all hope that they will reunite, but at this point, I don't think either Lisbeth or Blomkvist is capable of what I, personally, hope for the two of them.

253,1508601253,05/28/2021,3.0,"A lot less impressive and less enjoyable than the first in the series. Though the writing was strong, and the plot essentially was a good one, I found the structure and some of the characterisation very problematic. Maybe I didn't notice it as much in '..Dragon Tattoo', but Salander here was so equipped with unlimited resources and precognition and drive that it made her pretty unconvincing - less 'cool' in the admirably nerdy sense and more 'cool' in the sense I cared less about her. Her dark side laid on with a trowel, meh.I also found the structure of the book very problematic. It was a good two hundred pages before anything of any real significance in terms of crime occurred, which for a thriller was decidedly lacking in thrills. I also found many of the various police, journalists and associated people a little interchangeable and hard to follow - as if the book had a handful of strong characters written too strongly, and had no space to define the other fifteen or twenty characters with any permanency in my mind as a reader.",4,0.9721,0.079,0.73,0.191,0.4672839506172839,NEGATIVE,1.0

You really see things from Salander's point of view even when it's not actually her point of view being portrayed. Say for instance if you are looking through the eyes of one of these men who hate women, you still feel everything Salander feels because you just hate the men who hate women as well!Also the commentary on how the world is and how corrupt the police system can be in certain countries (don't wanna get into trouble) is so interesting and makes me speculate more about Larsson's life. It's so sad that he died before he could finish this trilogy, it seems like a complete disservice that he could never see how his books have made people question the world more. Weird to say as well but I have law exams coming up and it's really helped my critical thinking skills which is very very helpful for someone who is struggling like hell with their law degree.(view spoiler)[ Lisbeth Salander is just iconic and I love how strong she is but also this book explains why she is the way she is! She gets mispainted so much by 'men who hate women' because they want to label her as a 'd*ke' (incredibly derogatory) a psychopath, a satanist, anything just to pin her as a bad person because they think she will expose all of the bad things that they've done.

Lisbeth Salander is a fascinating woman whom readers first meet in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. In The Girl Who Played with Fire we learn about her background, gain insight into the events she managed to survive and thus shaped her into a pint sized dynamo with a knack for overcoming astronomical odds. We're introduced to her evil father and comic book style villain of a half brother. There are also a bunch of secondary characters in this book that seemed barely necessary. Since this is the second part of a trilogy, presumably there is wrapping up of subplots and fuller development of background characters in the final installment.

This one, too, seems to go on a bit longer than it needed to. The central story was good, although parts of it got out of hand. The titular girl, Lisabeth Salander, is at the center of a big mess. At the end of the first book, she made a huge score and wandered off to globe hop. This book starts with her doing that in a lot more detail than we need. Eventually, she goes back home, where we learn a lot about her tragic background. Her friend Mikel Blomkvist, a reporter, gets tangled up in a big expose about the sex trade. The two reporters working on the story end up dead, as does Lisabeth's guardian, and the police focus on her as the main suspect due to some strong but circumstantial evidence. There's a lot of chaos including closed-minded police, a lesbian Satanist rock band, a famous boxer, a motorcycle gang, a giant who can't feel pain, and a GRU defector. The central plot is pretty good, as the mystery of the murders unfolds, linked with Lisabeth's past. Bits of it are less good.

What doesn't is that everyone who knows her, despite her utter lack of social skills or consideration, thinks Lisabeth is the most amazing person ever.

276,130821919,11/14/2010,3.0,"The second entry in the Millennium trilogy had the same impression on me as the first: an interesting mystery with fascinating characters that somehow never seems to work itself up past a low hum.Lisbeth Salander, the brilliant, distant young hacker with a horrifying past, was put through the paces as a sidekick in the first book; this time, she takes center stage. Redeemed journalist Mikael Blomvkvist is working with two freelancing friends on an expose of sex trafficking in Sweden. When his friends end up dead, however, Salander's prints are found on the murder weapon. Suddenly, the intensely private Salander finds herself on the front page of every newspaper in Sweden, with multiple organizations tracking her down and most of the country convinced that she is a retarded psychopath. As Blomkvist attempts to find her and help her, he uncovers not only her surprising connections to the case, but begins to gain insight on how she became the surly loner she is. Meanwhile, Salander has to evade the tightening noose of journalists and police officers as she attempts to finish what the murder victims started.Here's the main problem I have with this book: the events above, which are advertised on the book jacket, don't actually happen until hundreds of pages in. As with the first book, Larsson takes the scenic route to the actual mystery, and in the meantime, we get a completely unrelated vignette of Salander's Caribbean adventures, a subplot with Erika Berger that ends up going nowhere, and about a third or so of the actual IKEA catalog, as far as I can tell. Once things actually start happening, they don't actually get interesting until around page 400 or so. And even the intense action sequences are rendered in Larsson's usual laconic, Prozac-laden drone, so that the most suspenseful scenes still feel clinical. Also, everyone in Sweden apparently buys dinner at 7-11. Weird.Oddly enough, all of that doesn't make for a bad read. Once again, I was invested in the story the whole way through, because I'm a fan of character work and these books are basically proving to be a series of detailed character sketches. I felt that the second book was actually more tightly plotted than the first. Even though the pacing still feels completely broken, the mystery is definitely less scattered and clumsy than the one in the first book.There's another annoyance that set in for me partway through this book, though. For all that Larsson's characters are interesting, I don't really buy the way in which he portrays female characters. I mean, being male, I could be completely off-base here, but each time I was presented with a female character, I couldn't get past the image of a male author trying to approximate a female voice. Salander's crass treatment in the first book gets a little more dimension in this one, and new insights into her psychological profile explain her voice a bit, but Mimmi? Modig? Johannson? Every last one of them reads like a middle-aged male fantasy of what a strong, sexual woman should sound like (which, by the way, is exactly how Salander and Berger came off in the first book, I'm realizing). Again, just my impression; I didn't buy them, and I'm beginning to understand why some readers classify the books as mildly misogynistic.Don't get me wrong, these books are good. I mean, they're... I don't know, competent. But I can't really wrap my head around the wild praise I keep hearing. The characterizations are largely great, but the writing is uneven, the pace is completely boned, and the narrative forgoes descriptive prose in favor of mountains of technical details. Also, I think maybe something is lost in translation, as some of the dialogue is painfully awkward and sometimes even nonsensical, which seems out of place amidst the painstaking prose in the rest of the book.Yeah, I'm picking on it a little. But even if I didn't get very excited about this book, I never lost interest, either. In fact, the focus on Salander is incredibly satisfying. I'd have even been pleasantly surprised by some of her backstory, if the director who made the Swedish movie out of the first book didn't decide to spoil this book in that movie. Goddamned jerk. Anyway, even though I'm whinging a little about this book, it's not bad at all. It's a decent thriller, and it definitely benefits from a comparison to the first in the trilogy.",3,0.9876,0.082,0.793,0.125,0.4273382513178432,NEGATIVE,0.7841

280,1968543431,04/11/2017,4.0,"Second book of the series and what a ride this one was, simply amazing, engaging and thrilling. There are a very few sequels which actually not only live up to the original but supersede it too. This is one of those books which not only is almost as good as the first one but in a way goes ahead and feels even better than the first one in many ways. Also, almost after every chapter I had a wide grin on my face and missed someone around me with who I could jump and do a Hi5, this was that great. I was like ""You go girl and do what you do best, kick some more...."". And Stieg Larsson, you take a bow man, why you had to die so soon, you could have given us some more of Lisbeth :(. The way he ends his books I can say now after reading two of them is that the story ends at the very last page of the book and all you have left is the back cover to look at. No epilogue, no conclusions, no cover ups, just 'The End"" and you shut the book, even that kept making me ask for more and I kept the third one quite near me in preparation. I am jumping straight to the third as soon as I post this. This I believe this is the third occasion that I am this keen to read the next after Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Clifton Chronicles (Jeffrey Archer), Any other Book(s) never had this magic on me ever. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ends and Lisbeth goes on a long long vacation (she becomes a millionaire overnight) and breaks all connections with Mikael Blomkvist. A new journalist at Millennium is about to uncover a dark secret behind the sex trade in Sweden and a lot of people are about to be named, somehow Lisbeth's name gets involved in killing of three people including the journalist. Also, her past comes haunting her and Mikael back and comes big time as every one believes she is not the killer and even Blomkvist believes she is capable of killing but his heart says she wont (even I kept praying). How the reality gets uncovered (shockingly) is just a terrific ride a little deeper inside Lisbeth's life as well as into whats goes on in the world around us. This one was such an amazing page turner that my eyes kept cheating, like I was actually at the top left page and my eyes will go to extreme right in the mid to see whats happening ahead :). Just couldn't control it. Stieg Larsson has a habit of overstretching the stuff to my delight and will never give someone something straight on a platter. For example, a world-class boxer who is a Lisbeth fan (and coach) is about to hit one final blow to a guy, may be killing him but it will take two pages of explanation in between telling us what was going through his head while he hit that final blow. The first book was about 500 pages long, second one goes ahead and crosses 550 pages and as I type this, just checked and imagine my 32 teeth smile because the last one has about 760 pages of fun to unfold :). Have you read these yet? If yes, you already know how and what I am feeling and if not, Oh Boy! You have no idea what you are missing. Movie Adaptation: One word - SUPERBAD. Oh My God!! What do I say, three hours and this is what they came out with. What a total crap this movie was. So much wished that Fincher was signed up to do the second and third movie too, this one feels like a B grade movie made for television. Almost a disaster of an adaptation, no background score a all, leaves so much which is desired big time from the book to be told untouched and some characters which aren't even mentioned in the movie. And it goes on for about 3 hours or a little longer :), I had to see it because I just had to, but please ignore if you have read the book as it is such a heart break. I am seriously contemplating not to see the movie after I finish the third and the last book of the series. ",3,0.9897,0.079,0.793,0.128,0.4439990564990564,POSITIVE,1.0
281,68995549,08/26/2009,5.0,"Amazing.I had trouble getting into the first book in Steig Larsson's Millenium series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but after the first hundred pages, I couldn't put the book down. The Girl Who Played With Fire is the second installment, and from page one, I was completely engrossed. Where the first book took a lot of time to build up the storyline, FIRE hits the ground running.I am completely fascinated by Lisbath Salander, ""the Girl"" in these books. I couldn't wait to read more about her. The book picks up two years after the last one leaves off. In that time, Lisbeth has matured, settled some debts, and starts to find a quiet place for herself in the world. Meanwhile, Mikael Blomkvist and his business partners at Millenium magazine are investigating the seedy underground world of sex trafficking.The two don't seem to have anything to do with one another at all, and even I couldn't conceive of how Larsson was going to bring these two characters together again. Then, the bomb drops. Two of Blomkvists's friends are murdered the same night as Salander's pig of a guardian, and Lisbeth is the solitary prime suspect in all three murders.I will not give too much away, but my fascination with the character of Lisbeth Salander is satisfied by learning a lot more about her, her past, and her motivations. There is lots of action, tons of suspense, and a pace that leaves you awake at 2 AM turning the pages -- don't say I didn't warn you!I must say that there are good writers out there that write mediocre dialogue. Sometimes you can look past it, but it reminds me of how hard it is to write great dialogue. Larsson was a genius at writing great dialogue. The cast of characters in his two books so far could fill a small cruiseliner, but they each have their own voice that is so distinct from the others. I won't lie. I can't pronounce all of the characters' names, and this would have bugged me in any other novel. But I found that I didn't need to know their names. Their voices were enough to distinguish them from one another. A true master. If you're a writer, you need to read his dialogue and take notes.Larsson never fails to twist and turn his plots, completely surprising his readers. More than once, I gasped out loud, and on one occassion toward the end of the novel, I actually yelled, ""NO WAY!""I think the best review of this book I can give is something ""the Man"" said to me as I was reading one night. As he was watching Monday Night Football, I sat on the other side of the couch reading FIRE. At one point, he said, ""Do you realize your hands are clenched into fists?"" I was so engrossed in this book, I hadn't even noticed.AMAZING book. Just as good as the first.A NOTE: The Girl Who Played With Fire could be read as a stand alone book, although reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is worth every page. That being said, after reading the synopsis for The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, you will have to have read at least the second book before diving into the third. Do yourself a favor, read them all.To read more of my reviews, please visit my book blog: Alison's Book Marks",3,0.9948,0.055,0.809,0.135,0.4175710594315247,POSITIVE,0.9937
282,498948811,01/07/2013,5.0,"Just in case you thought the late  Stieg Larsson‚Äôs first book in the Millennium series‚Äî The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo‚Äîwas a fluke, back he comes with this explosive sequel. Larsson pulls no punches in  The Girl Who Played with Fire, which is every bit as good as‚Äîor arguably better than‚Äîits predecessor.This time, there‚Äôs none of the slow build up that was, on reflection, perhaps necessary in the first instalment. Our main players on the stage are set‚Äîand we‚Äôre ready to dive straight in. Larsson plays on our‚Äîand indeed the character‚Äîfamiliarity, as Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist quickly become embroiled in a double murder investigation‚Äîand it is difficult to know who to trust.A year on from the Wennerstr√∂m success and everyone at Millennium magazine is still on a high: publically, their reputation is through the roof, with circulation going well and themed articles in the pipeline. However, perhaps inevitably, they won‚Äôt stop there: a young, ambitious couple‚ÄîDag Svensson, a journalist that reminds Mikael of his younger, hungrier self; and his girlfriend Mia Johansson‚Äîhave come to the magazine with some key information.Together, they have put together a detailed, revealing exploration of the effects of sex-trafficking in Sweden, including a comprehensive expose of high-ranking figures‚Äîin the police, media and government‚Äîinvolved in abusing young girls. Once again, Sweden is set for some explosive headlines, and certain people will not want that information coming to the public attention.Salander, not one to miss out on something she feels strongly about, begins to investigate the material herself. This time, the desire to remain anonymous and not tell anyone of her actions backfires horrendously, and it isn‚Äôt long before she is the subject of everyone‚Äôs attention: Dragan Armansky, her one-time boss; Mikael Blomkvist, with whom she has cut off all contact; and the police, who are ready to bring her in, and are out for her arrest.The media attention has exploded; Salander‚Äôs face is all over the news, details of her personal life and tortured childhood printed across the internet for all to see. As she goes into hiding she realises that there‚Äôs more to this than meets the eye; her past has come back to haunt her in the worst possible way. Even for a woman of Salander‚Äôs means and talents, there may not be a way out. After working all her life to remain anonymous, Lisbeth‚Äôs story has begun to leak out.The action in The Girl Who Played with Fire is relentless. Larsson unravels the mystery one page at a time, but it never feels slow‚Äîthere‚Äôs enough high-octane car chases and fights to keep us thoroughly engaged. The book races towards its furious denoument and the reader is left breathless and stunned. There is no other choice: Larsson‚Äôs finale‚Äî The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet‚Äôs Nest‚Äîawaits.",3,-0.8834,0.092,0.834,0.073,0.4607631257631258,NEGATIVE,0.665
283,63891579,07/17/2009,4.0,"Heaps and heaps better than The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo The pacing is much tighter; therefore, the plot is far more engaging. I didn't have the stomach for a psycho-sexual sadistic warp posing as a thriller and I was worried that the opening sequence and the grinding of plot gears early on would sink this into some Patricia Cornwellian swamp. Not to worry, this is as polished as an Ikea Solar kitchen. Oh, there is plenty of bone-crunching, blood-spattering, hog-tied violence, to be sure. But it's just surface stuff that can be remedied with an espresso, a few hours' sleep and some pizza. Well, except for the guy who received the chainsaw treatment. And of course there have to be a couple of regrettable murders to give us bad guys to chase. I did have some eye-rolling moments at the digressive trip to the Caribbean which included a boy toy for Salander and an inevitable hurricane. This seemed largely irrelevant when the real action awaited in Stockholm. Larsson's pedantic recitation of Berger's m√©nage-√†-trois (actual and fantastical) seemed written just for the gents, as did Salander's boob job and Mimmi's character as a sex dynamo. These lusty and luring extras threatened to demean one of the central threads of his plot-the exposition of Sweden's sex slave trade. But dudes, Salander can kick some Swedish ass. All other characters, including milque-toast Blomkvist, fade when Salander takes the stage. I loved that she emerges as the strongest and most rational being north of the 59th parallel, despite all appearances to the contrary. Whereas in ...Dragon Tattoo... her emotional fragility made her manipulative and annoying and led to a gross but predictable daughter-lover-friend-whatever relationship with Blomkvist, this time around she comes out swinging. I love her linear thinking that is innocence and calculation packaged in 100 pounds of steel. Salander could out-Bourne Jason Bourne and still be baffled by a packet of instant oatmeal. There are great moments of policing (notice I did not write ""moments of great policing""!), journalistic sleuthing, big bad road hogs, an adorable Brazilian boxing champ, giants with genetic disorders and lots of caffeine consumption. Despite the blood, sugar, sex and even some magik, there is a gleam of blond wood and spotless white crockery to the characters that I chock up to Scandinavian forthrightness and need for order. There are no slovenly private dicks with corrupted skeletons in the closet and a passel of ex-wives in their wake or asexual, poetry writing Detective Inspectors, only white upper-middle class Protestants in Frye boots, a fierce Jewish DI (whom I hope we see in the next, and sadly last, Larsson tome) and a seedy underbelly of thugs who own homey summer cabins on the lake shore. Only Lisbeth Salander leaks dark secrets, but even she divests herself of her oh-so-2000s body piercings and victim profile to become a modern gunslinger, PDA in one hand, pistol in the other. Shine on, you crazy diamond.  ",3,0.9714,0.07,0.825,0.105,0.4902454780361756,NEGATIVE,0.9722
284,73594364,10/05/2009,4.0,"This evening I finished up Stieg Larsson‚Äôs The Girl who Played with Fire. My impressions were that it was not as perfect as the first one. That said, it was real damn good.Mikael Blomqvist has been riding high ever since his expose of the Wennerstrom company in Millennium. During the last year Lisbeth Salander has been jaunting around the world and has ended up in the Caribbean, sunning herself and studying mathematics. They have not spoken to each other for reasons Mikael doesn‚Äôt know.Millennium is approached by altruistic freelance journalist, Dag Svensson. Erica Berger and Mikael decide to publish a book of his exposing the sex trafficking in Sweden. In a round about way this leads to three murders that end in a nation wide manhunt for Salander (who has returned from her excursion). Mikael knows she is innocent and that he must find proof of this before the police locate her.The case in this book intrigued me less than the Vanger disappearance from Dragon Tattoo. I rather enjoyed the cold case aspect of the first book. That said, that was the only part of the book that left me cold. The rest of the book is a mad dash from one event to another that leaves the reader breathless. I found myself gasping many times throughout the book.What makes it so interesting, once again, is Salander. Lisbeth is the outcast poster child for our generation. She‚Äôs mad, she‚Äôs violent, she‚Äôs unwilling to compromise her ideals, and she‚Äôs completely vacant when it comes to trust. Still, she‚Äôs hella fun to read. I adore her. She perfectly crystallizes the idea that people, ultimately, are duplicitous ‚Äì She maintains a strict privacy to the point of being a hermit yet she invades peoples private thoughts by hacking into their computers. She expects men to treat women well, yet she is suspicious that all men are out to harm women and protects herself any way possible. There‚Äôs one sentence in the book that sums up Salander very well ‚Äì ‚ÄúSalander was the woman who hated men who hate women‚Äú. Salander may be all contradiction, but every action she performs is precise, and correct. Lisbeth is a perfect character.One more book. One more damned MYSTERY book (‚Äúshe said a dirty word!‚Äù). To be truthful though, had Larsson lived and written dozens of books following the misadventures of Mikael ‚ÄúKalle‚Äù Blomqvist and Salander, I would probably have read all of them. I just love these characters so. The irony is had he not died would they have become the worldwide publishing phenom that they are? Who knows?

285,127662977,10/24/2010,5.0,"When I finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I thought to myself, ""Man, there really is something to this Stieg Larsson hype"". I absolutely loved it. However, when it ended, I thought, ""Is there really a need for a 2nd and 3rd book?"" Granted, I loved all of the characters but it seemed like everything was tied up pretty nicely. This was probably the reason I waited several months before picking up the sequel, The Girl Who Played with Fire. I could not have been more wrong.Pardon my french, but I fucking LOVE Lisbeth Salander. When I put down the first book, I had a great appreciation for the character but after finishing the 2nd installment - I think I fell in love with her. It could create some problems seeing as I'm married and my wife may be a tad bit upset by this revelation but she's a fictional character (Salander, not my wife), so I'm sure it's all good. Also, I don't think I'd really have a chance with her anyway. She's just a little out of my league.The book moves a tad slower than I would have liked but it was more or less along the same lines as the first one - so it's hard to call out Larsson on that. However, when he's writing the action scenes, he seems to do so with a sense of urgency that comes across as very exciting. I was sucked in deep when Salander was caught up in more than a few confrontations. While she's missing from a good portion of the novel, Larsson does not leave you waiting impatiently for her return. Probably due to how strong the supporting cast is and the few subplots that he's woven throughout.Also, it's worth noting that he really dug deep and unearthed his violent side as the final few chapters have some of the most brutal scenes he's yet to write. I really don't want to give a lot away in regards to specifics but there's a few weapons that do some pretty gruesome damage.I'm really looking forward to the next entry, which I have bumped up my ""to-read"" list. This one ends with you wanting more and some questions are left unanswered. It's such a shame that Larsson passed away, Salander is such an iconic character. I can probably guess that she'll be farmed out to other writers in an effort to keep the series going - the potential to make more money is a hard thing to deny. Let's hope that the quality does not suffer because I'd be willing to keep reading.",3,0.993,0.104,0.706,0.19,0.445496632996633,NEGATIVE,0.6984
286,367172595,07/12/2012,4.0,"Wow, What a ride!I have no idea why it took me so long to start this book after I finished the first one. But I know one thing, It won't take me long to pick the third one. In fact I already have it on my nook!Lisbeth Salander is a hell of a character, truly memorable. She's come to become one of my favorite characters in literature. She's like no normal ""heroine"" in other books, she's a mystery, you sometimes can't foresee what she's going to do or explain why she did other things.I think the mystery in this book was way more intriguing than the one presented in the first book. It kept me guessing what was happening, sometimes the turn of events were made to make the reader believe other things and get confused. You start reading, you think you know everything that's happening because you're seeing the whole picture not just someone's point of view and then all of a sudden, you're left with no clue, you don't know what happened and don't know what to believe in and what not...It was fantastic!A truly engaging experience.What I didn't like much, maybe because I didn't really understand correctly how it happened is that Lisbeth was now rich. I'd rather see her as a ""regular"" citizen instead of one of the high elite. I don't see it fit somehow.The story was very well built, everything that could be solved in this book was solved satisfactorily, and it let you with a cliffhanger... hungry for more.Definitely, I would recommend this series. Can't wait to know what happens next and solve some doubts I still have.Read it!
**SPOILERS**
I thought it was really interesting how all the people who actually knew Lisbeth, at least a little, spoke so high of her, giving her praise as the best researcher and someone with strong morals. While everyone who didn't know her at all thought she was retarded and with many mental illnesses.Some of the characters were changing their opinion towards Lisbeth as time passed and so did the reader in certain matters.I find it a bit odd how Blomkvist always thought Lisbeth was innocent when he didn't have a clue about that, he hadn't known about her since more than a year ago. There was no way he could've come up with any conclusions but he just supported himself in how much he believed in her.In the end, I think Salander will live but I still want to know what happens, I'm sure we will have now some political issues regarding the case of Zalashenko because now it will all be exposed by the press.And who knows what more surprises we will have with Salander's twin.

The Girl Who Played with Fire is definitely (probably?) not better than #1, but definitely not worse either. I‚Äôm not sure which wording is right but the book is great.It doesn‚Äôt have the oldschool Agathachristie‚Äôesque feels like the Dragon Tattoo did, but in contrast, can be considered a great example of a well-constructed, beautifully written modern crime novel. I‚Äôve already established that crime novels either take the approach of a rebus where the reader is left in the shade just like the detective; or one where the reader is (or becomes) omniscient: knowing everything that‚Äôs happening better than either party. Stieg Larsson does both and does that wonderfully keeping the reader on the edge the whole time. I was disappointed at first to learn that Salander is centered out in this one since I loved Blomkwist a lot. But the thing is that she isn‚Äôt. Larsson manages to multitask like no other, creating several main characters, shifting from one perspective to another with no turbulence, knitting an incredible web of story lines neither of which is left untangled, all the while constantly sprinkling everything with new spices and dust of wonder. Speaking of untangling, at the end of Dragon tattoo, I missed the conclusion on the sadist, rapist pig Bjurman line and was delighted to see that it‚Äôs developed in #2. On the other hand, I made 2 mistakes: 1. watched the movie (Dragon tattoo) in the midst of #2 and was not so delighted to discover that it had spoiled the line of when All the Evil happened which was hidden until the end of #2.2. Read the description of #3 which spoiled the aftermath of #2. (Eye roll)Anyway, the only possible criticism would probably be that sometimes some of the stories/conflicts were resolved in a slightly unpersuasive manner (how in three seconds someone figures out a password, finds a hideout barn in the middle of nowhere, ends a fight etc) which may seem like editing blunders, knowing how, based on the descriptions and details Larsson provides, one could literally furnish his apartment Salander style; or it‚Äôs simply that Larsson is a describer, stage setter, a director with a great sense for language, dialogue, style, so a few cracks in plot development can surely be forgiven. All in all, Stieg Larsson‚Äôs books feel like movies, great TV series, great books that reminisce childhood reading under the cover with a flashlight because a page turns another.

Two things kept me reading this book: 1) the character of Lisbeth Salander, who, unlike all of the other characters in the book (and the previous book), is compelling and more real than Larsson probably wants. Certainly, he does his best to turn her into a cartoon with superhuman strength (ever dig yourself out of a grave with a bullet in your brain?), incredible mental capacity (Fermat's theorem? No problem!), and a sweet load of luck (of *course* the murderous giant with no capacity to feel pain is terrorized by imaginary demons that look just like Lisbeth does at the end of the book). However, just by being consistently at odds with the other characters, she elicits our sympathy. 2) The need to have answers. The structure of this book is terrible: anticlimactic (the omniscent author tells us the solution to the mystery long before Blomkvist twigs to it; Blomkvist is able to tie up the unstoppable killer with surprisingly little effort), and repetitive (e.g., the same part of the story is told through Blomkvist and then Salander's eyes, to the point of repeating an entire email exchange). However, we keep reading to find out what ""All the Evil"" is, and who Zalachenko might be, etc., etc. We want to know because he tells us that we don't know--as fascinating as an unexplained magic trick, or a three-card monte dealer. I haven't seen the movies yet, but I can see how they would be an improvement on the books, because no director nowadays could put such lifeless characters onscreen, or be so careless with plot structure and rhythm. One hopes they don't repeat the exploitive treatment of women, ostensibly in their own defense. That's a whole other essay.If you read the books, read them quickly, lest you start noticing even more issues--the number of times people drive past a car coming in the opposite direction full of people who are looking for them; the fact that Lisbeth uses a Wasp Enterprises credit card as herself in Granada and as her alter ego in Sweden.

That's half the fun - reading on until you find out the answer.The other half is the action, and there's plenty of it. Stieg Larsson is a master at describing what's going on, giving plenty of forensic detail, right down to the pizza boxes in the corner, maintaining the pace, and cunningly concealing his surprises. There's a scene in a warehouse that is beautifully set up and if you are not gasping for breath by the end of it, you need a checkup. Or more coffee.A map of Sweden would help. Maybe someone has set up a Google Maps template for the action. I'm tempted to go visit Stockholm on my next trip to check out some of the locations. It sounds like a well-ordered, pleasant, comfortable place to live. Apart from the homicidal maniacs wandering around attacking people.Echoes of Miss Smilla in the odd title character. A pintsize powerhouse, she has extraordinary abilities, and she needs every one of them and more to survive.There's a scene with a fox towards the end of the book that will stick in your memory for a long time.I put this book down, drew breath, and reached for the next in the series.

292,145474758,02/02/2011,4.0,"Playing with fire:In this brief review I try not to get too involved in plot details and summary, leaving it up to the reader to find them out him/herself. Let's just say that the men who hate women also hate Salander and they really pay for their indiscretions in this book. There are still some loose ends but I'm hoping Larsson ties them up in the third book.The second Larsson book is just as brilliant as the first one, even more so for several reasons. In the first book we met a quirky but bright girl named Salander. Then we meet a journalist bulldog named Blomkvist. In the second book the author ties up loose ends from the first book, creates more loose ends which (hopefully) will be tied up in the third. In the middle we have some intense actions and interesting detective work. Larsson really loves criticizing authority in this novel. The police detectives, themselves competent, have to deal with leaks and criminal mischief in their own ranks. The two who leak info to the press have their own grudges against Salander. The build-up of suspense is quite slow: We learn of Salander's adventures in the Caribbean, her return to Sweden to look up some old friends, checks up on the rapist pig that is Bjurman, who himself is trying to hire a hit-man to rub out Salandar (thanks to a damning video explained in the first book) and suddenly finds herself an interested party in a triple murder!Larsson's themes of corrupt journalism, lack of privacy of the individual citizen, the rampant disregard for patients from the psychiatric profession is real, is fascinating and is clearly taken from Larrson's own experiences. The ending of the novel wraps some things up, but Blomkvist still needs to put up with some pretty blatant stupidity on the part of the police force (there's a sneak peek at the end of the book for ""Kicked the Hornet's Nest.""). Salander is kicked, punched, shot at and left for dead and yet still manages to be a prime character in this exciting, at times plodding, yet fascinating thriller of a book. A must-read!

293,3866641058,07/16/2021,4.0,"The second book in the Millenium series, as good as the first one! Maybe even more fast-paced than the first one.The one particular thing I have noticed is, the author is unapologetically feminist. He calls out all kinds of issues faced by women solely because they are women. Domestic violence and abuse, sexual violence and rape, prejudices related to choices including clothes and sexuality, workplace harassment.Go for it if you are in the mood for a good thriller! :)",3,-0.9229,0.208,0.689,0.103,0.4575757575757576,POSITIVE,0.9969
294,2402226119,05/24/2018,5.0,"*4.5 stars* Larsson has done it again.Should have I been doing assignments? Yes. But this book was addicting as drugs dammit and perhaps even more enjoyable (I don't do drugs so I wouldn't know, unless Panadol counts).There really isn't more to say. I loved everything about The Girl Who Played with Fire. I loved how the plot wasn't the formulaic crime story that I am so used to, ie. the crime, the suspects, and then the great reveal. There was a whole world full of stories and characters overlapping together so I felt like I was reading a journalistic article, not fiction. I loved the quirky characters, especially Lisbeth, and how different they are to the archetypal characters in other crime stories - stereotyped to fit under labels such as 'suspect' and 'detective.' How many versions of the superior, socially awkward Sherlock have we seen through the years? It's refreshing to see something entirely new in the genre. I loved Larsson's writing in general. He includes bits and pieces of his knowledge throughout the novel, and I felt myself learning so much. I learned about the Russian mafia, the Swedish economy and mathematics - for no reason other than that Larsson wanted to include it in the novel and that was fine with me. Knowledge, for the most part, is good. As usual, I didn't have the slightest clue as to how the crime would be solved. Honestly, a child could write a crime story and I would still be wondering how it would be solved. I'm so darn gullible, but this just makes mysteries and thrillers all the more enjoyable for me. I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen and the experience is just so exciting. I've bought The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest ahead of time, so you know what I'm reading next!

295,3504767741,08/21/2020,,"really entertaining. My main complaint is that the book started with Lisbeth becoming obsessed with Fermat‚Äôs last theorem and discovering a proof, and EVERY CHAPTER started with some math-related identity, and she DISCOVERS A PROOF THAT IS SIMPLER THAN ANDREW WILES‚Äô, but then she is shot buried alive etc. and forgets her proof, and never remembers it again ..... not even in the last book ... why the heavy emphasis on it and on math when it‚Äôs just dropped? I was really sad I was so looking forward for it to be tied into the story somehow. It could have even paralleled her solving another unrelated problem but it didn‚Äôt :( Otherwise, I wish Zala were a more impressive character. The way he‚Äôs introduced, as this shadow on the periphery that you don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs real or not, is so ominous and scary and cool. And considering his progeny, lisbeth and niedermann, he should be totally genius or a mastermind or something. Instead he‚Äôs just ... not. The prostitution ring that the journalist who got killed/his wife had uncovered, presumably the connection to Zala and what Zala was the mastermind of, is never really spoken of again, even in the third book. Zala has an anticlimactic death and he‚Äôs just not that impressive as a character, which I think was a lost opportunity. All in all though this book is probably better than the first, because there‚Äôs no attempt to tie in religious or supernatural shit, it‚Äôs all to do with underworld crime and he‚Äôs very good at writing about that. It‚Äôs main attraction, I think, is being revenge porn against men who hate women. Which is undoubtedly satisfying to read.",3,-0.8884,0.157,0.713,0.13,0.5855172413793105,NEGATIVE,0.9026
296,67073515,08/12/2009,3.0,"This was a gripping read and ends on quite the cliff-hanger. How long till we get The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, I wonder? I enjoyed jumping back into this world and especially enjoyed spending more time with Lizbeth Salander. She is a wonderful character and makes this series. So complex, so unique, and so mysterious. We learn more about her, but there is much still to learn. (What about her twin, for instance? My guess is she is going to show up eventually. Otherwise, why create her? Or Fermat's theorem --- did she solve it?)It is harsh, full of coincidences that I just was willing to accept, and engrossing. All that said, I have a couple of quibbles. First of all the major one: the overly detailed tech material annoyed me (as it did in the first book, I admit). Here's a random example, ""The hotel did not have broadband, but she had a built-in modem that she could hook up to her Panasonic mobile phone and with that setup she could send and receive mail. She typed a message to "" (p 25) This sort of stuff is all through the book. I understand that some of the plot revolves around technology, but I just don't see the need for giving product names and the degree of detail given. Much of it is completely out-of-date (e.g. a Palm PDA). I suppose this is the way Larsson wrote it and so since he isn't around they are being true to his vision. The other thing that tripped me up now and then was the sentence level writing. I couldn't figure out if it was Larsson or the translation. For example, ""Gnawing on his dilemma."" Didn't happen often, but occasionally. Otherwise it is a very entertaining read. Perfect for the summer, I thought. ",3,0.98,0.023,0.861,0.116,0.6098809523809524,NEGATIVE,0.9286
297,145305080,02/01/2011,3.0,"This time I finished the book. I give it 3 stars. The writing style is ""classic Stieg"", detailed, but with enough carrots to keep you chasing. It's a 700+ page brick. Again, like #1 in the series, I don't understand the ""Stieg hysteria"", but yeah, it's good enough to read through, and there are some cool moments. It just takes some patience.What follows is my earlier review from around 2011:I'll just copy and paste an email I wrote to a neighbor; I quit the book about 40% of the way through. This breaks my rule about reviewing unfinished books, but you know what they say about rules - they're made for la-hooo-haaaa-zairrres. OK, here's the email I wrote:I tried to read Stieg #2, but I got to the part where some cop is looking through all the personal effects of the murdered author to be (Dag?) and doctoral candidate (Mia?). I mean, it just goes on for like, 5 pages, around page 211. And this isn't the first time in the sequel where Stieg's editor should have left film on the cutting room floor. (And remember the passage in #1 where Stieg spends like 10 pages talking about the photos and microfilm Bloomquist has to look through? I mean, Jeez-a-loo already.) I really don't need to know all 25 items that Lisbeth bought at the grocery store, OK? But that's only a paragraph. There are quite a few times in the first 200 pages where Stieg tells the gory details of some activity, and I think, Sidney Sheldon would've had 3 interesting chapters by now. Sorry, I have to disagree, I can't do Stieg. I returned the ebook unfinished. Throw me under the bus with the unwashed proletariat.So, there it is.
