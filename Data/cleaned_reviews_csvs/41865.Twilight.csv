0,6904616,09/27/2007,5.0,"Oh my. This book, to me, is like chocolate: a delicious, sinful, addictive indulgence which you convince yourself has beneficial qualities (zinc, calcium, keeps me quiet at that time of the month...) in order to justify your addiction.By ""beneficial qualities"", I mean that it's reading, and since when is reading bad? :) Let me say quite clearly that I'm a sucker for romance, especially the intense, passionate, tragic kind. I don't read romance novels*, though, because to me they are lacklustre - Meyer's book has the extra edge I need, though, a great way of keeping doom hanging over the main characters' heads: she's human, he's a vampire.Sound corny? Yeah, I know, and the only reason Meyer gets away with it as well as she does is because Twilight doesn't try to be anything it's not, and it has such conviction. Only Meyer could get away with giving her narrator the name Isabella Swan. She says in her little bio at the back that she wanted to write believable characters: an interesting choice, then, to write about vampires, but I believed in them, and without such a willing suspension of disbelief, the story would have been a farce. True, a lot of people haven't been able to suspend their disbelief with this book, but that doesn't affect my reading experience :)Seventeen year old Bella's parents are divorced. She lives with her mum in Phoenix, Arizona, and spends time with her dad Charlie in Forks, Washington State, where it rains almost constantly. She hates Forks, but when her mum remarries a baseball player, Phil, and starts travelling with him, Bella decides to move to Forks.On her first day at school she notices the isolated group of five beautiful, graceful siblings. Rosalie, Alice, Emmet, Edward and Jasper. One in particular catches her eye: Edward Cullen, with his rust-brown hair and topaz eyes. She is more than a little surprised and shocked when he seems to have developed an acute, profound hatred of her. Her fascination deepens, especially when, after a brief disappearance, he saves her life. She soon figures out what Edward is, and the knowledge doesn't frighten her. The shaky friendship between them develops into something much stronger, and Edward reveals his overpowering reaction to her smell that nearly made him kill her on the spot - hence the look on his face that so shocked her, and the restraint he put on himself during an hour of Biology.Let's not forget he's incredibly handsome: even though Bella describes almost every glance he makes and every twitch of his lips, not once did I get bored and roll my eyes. My fascination grew alongside hers, until I too fell in love with Edward - in a totally girly, daydreamy way. Yes, I admit it. I don't know if that makes this a girly kind of book - these days those boundaries don't seem to matter so much, and the vampire family is pretty darn cool, what with Edward's extra ability to read minds, Alice's premonitions, Jasper's ability to affect people's emotions, their speed, their invincibility... Bella is at one point compared to Lois Lane, because Edward and his kin really are like Superman.One of the things I love about YA books: the clarity with which they are written. Granted there is some repetition in Twilight, but to me it's necessary repetition. There's nothing superfluous in Twilight, nothing that shouldn't be there, and the flow, the pacing, is great. It's a fat book, but I read it in two days. I read it with breakfast, on my walk to the subway, on the subway, up the escalator, through the ticket gates, to work, in my lunch break ... you get the picture. I couldn't get enough of it, and it left me with that same craving for more that Harry Potter did (I remember scrounging around for loose change as soon as I finished one of them and dashing off into the city to get my next fix. It helped that four were already out when I started). There's plenty of negative stuff you could say about this book - the writing, the characters, the obsession - but again, I couldn't care less :)Another thing I loved was all the vampire myths Meyer scrapped. These vampires aren't burnt to ash by sunlight: their marble skin glitters as the sunlight is broken into miniscule shards, like diamonds - hence why they are living in Forks, where the sun hardly ever shines. They are not hurt by crucifixes or stakes through the heart. They do not sleep at all, nor do they eat human food. They drive fast cars really really fast. And they can fall in love. Awwww.Seriously though, this was one of most fun, most enjoyable, most romantic books I've read in a long time, and I'm so happy there are two more out with a fourth on the way. They are, somewhat predictably, making Twilight into a movie - still in the early development stage - but it's rather fun to go to the author's website and see her own preferences for actors to play Edward etc. Can't say I'm familiar with most of them, but her top choice (now sadly too old), is indeed a perfect match. Who knows who they'll really cast, but as with the book, the characters have to be right or the whole story will be just silly and sappy._____________________________________*Since reading this the first time back in 2007, I've started reading some romance novels. Yes I've been corrupted. Or rather, I've always loved romance stories but had trouble admitting it. Now, I just don't care :)",976,0.999,0.069,0.749,0.182,0.565180299260488,POSITIVE,0.9817
1,21231663,04/29/2008,1.0,"I hate this book. I will probably end up reading the rest of them, because if I don't, people that love this thing will think they can convert me if I just keep reading. (ETA (Jan. 2013): Never even remotely bothered to finish the series. I said that as a joke to begin with, and I did not finish the series. Did not finish them, not for irony's sake or for amusement's sake or as some kind of amulet to ward off kind-hearted Twimoms that would encourage me with ""they get better!"" I hope that clears that up for some folks that seem to have had a tough time with ""I did not finish them."" One last time for posterity: I can pretty much be defined as a Person That Would Be Caught Dead in a Dumpster Before Reading the Rest of These Damn Books. So long as we're all clear on that now, ONWARD!)In short: the writing mechanics are atrocious. The dialogue is stilted and absolutely wretched. The characterization is bad-- loose, jumpy, and the progression is occasionally senseless. The main characters themselves are not compelling: selfish, shallow, lacking the deep thought that comes with true passion and love and instead leaping recklessly into stupid and deadly situations when anyone with a brain could see sixty other possibilities that should have been tried first.I can't express my disgust for the relationship between Edward and Bella. It's not romance, it's not passion, it's not love. It's selfish idiocy at best. Bella as a character is insufferable: her self-sacrificing streak is not compassion, it's sheer stupidity. It's hormones. It's a bad, bad example for the teenage girls who read it. Bella's whole life is tied up in her boyfriend. She has no goals, passions, ambitions, or dreams besides wanting to be with Edward, who could kill her.Edward's element of danger is occasionally compelling, but it's totally overshadowed by the fact that Bella is completely oblivious to it. She doesn't fear him at all, and that doesn't come off like love: once again, it comes off as total stupidity.Edward. What can I say about Edward. There is nothing lovable about him except that he is apparently the most beautiful thing in existence. He's selfish: he stays near Bella when he knows he could lose control and kill her at any second. He's a creepy stalker: he watches her while she sleeps, before she even really knows him. He's volatile: his mood swings are insane and ridiculous. He's immature: for someone who's been alive for a hundred years, he doesn't seem to have gained much experience. He's controlling: he doesn't want to let her out of his sight for two seconds. (Granted, she's dumb enough to get herself killed if he does.) He's insulting: he treats Bella like an incapable, silly little girl. (Which he's right to, but I digress. It's still insulting.)I understand that Bella's smell and that Bella herself are irresistible to him. But if he wanted the best for her, he'd stay away from her, period, the end. The story is stupid, the love story is bad, and if that's what Stephenie Meyer is preaching to teenage girls, I think it's pretty questionable. It's not just ""a fun read"". There are girls out there who want to be Bella and who want to find an Edward.Anyway.I think I might enjoy the story a lot more if Bella's head was not the one I had to spend time in while reading it. If I had to read one more description of how beautiful Edward is, I was going to choke a kitten. If it had focused more on the vampire family I would have been a lot more willing to forgive its faults. I thought Carlisle's and Alice's stories were really compelling, and Edward was finally accessible to me when he talked about Carlisle turning him into a vampire and how his family came to be formed, his life before Bella, etc. Some aspects of the vampirism were truly awesome: I found the idea that vampires can never sleep completely terrifying. That they never, ever get a break and never, ever get to rest... that is a wonderful and ghastly idea.Entirely overshadowed by their flowery breath and the fact that they sparkle. Mothereffing ridiculous.This is hardly the tip of the iceberg, but I'm trying to spare you at least a little.",1625,-0.9601,0.148,0.732,0.12,0.58465052389471,NEGATIVE,1.0
2,26448271,07/06/2008,3.0,"It turns out we don't need Dr. John Gray to tell us that men are from Transylvania and women are from Venus. We just need to read Stephenie Meyer books. For example, from this book we learn that the millions of women who have wolfed down the Twilight series (pun intended) want men who:1. Talk about their feelings. Either Meyer's husband is the single-most communicative male on the planet and she doesn't realize how unusual he is, or she, like most of her female readers, is using her fiction to imagine a world where men not only have deep emotions but want to admit to having them and talk about them over and over, articulating even the most subtle of their internal dramas. 2. Make them flutter. But just being a sensitive new-age kind of guy doesn't cut it. A man has to be hard-bodied, chiseled, dashing, and have eyes that pierce the soul, if not the skin (even as they never look at your chest). This book suggests that a real man makes you constantly stumble over your words, bite your lip to refrain from exclaiming adulations, and lose yourself in the sweet smell of his breath. 3. Are fiercely devoted. That a girl of no spectacular beauty, who lacks any trace of conversation skills -- whose only virtue is that she smells really yummy -- can inspire an immortal creature of godlike power and grace to alter his entire existence to serve and protect her, watching over her by night (more on that in #4). This is a woman's ultimate fantasy -- to have the perfect man, perfectly devoted, for no good reason at all.4. Want them so bad that they won't take them. This, alas, is the most transparent aspect of this book's appeal. It speaks volumes about the differences between men and women to have so many women toss their bodice-ripping romances aside in order to read how a feral man with otherworldly physical desires can contain his passion and lust out of his pure and perfect love for his beloved. It says that women really do wish they could have it both ways, to be an object of lust and devotion at once, to fulfill a man's desire without actually slaking his thirst for her. To have a man watch you sleep and not want to have even a little peek under the covers -- now that's hot fantasy for today's woman who is otherwise told on a regular basis that to be her best self she has to enage in casual and risky sexual behavior. To see just what an indulgent fantasy this book is, just imagine the male-centric version of Twilight, in which a troubled teen boy moves to a small town to find the hottest girl in town is a vampiress. Such a book would be about 100 pages long (all the unnecessary internal dialogue would be removed). No one would talk except to comment on the awesome size of, um, one's videogame library. The vampiress would be simple: relatively dumb, incredibly hot, wearing almost nothing, and with no expectations of her man but drawn to him only by the smell of his gym bag. She wouldn't hold herself back from trying to bite her intended, but would get so distracted with his bedroom technique that she would never get around to it. We would laugh at such a book (in fact, we know it would never be a book since men don't read; it would be a movie, and it would be a smash summer hit called American Vam-Pie-er, I'll start the screenplay right away). Somehow, when this story is told in a similarly indulgent female-centric vein, we don't reject it, but sympathize with it. I believe this is because women get to indulge in their fantasies so rarely outside of Jane Austen novels while men are surrounded with theirs. So far I have yet see spam email inviting one to ""read hot things devoted husbands would say to their wives"" or ""see pictures of hunks promising not to get nasty out of respect for their women"" or ""buy this purple pill so you can stay up late and share your feelings -- seven times in one night!."" So hats off to Stephenie Meyer for figuring out what it is that women really want and giving it to them. ",1515,0.9988,0.048,0.773,0.179,0.5516645391645393,NEGATIVE,0.5944
3,1744681,06/07/2007,1.0,"I really enjoy lively details. There's nothing better than knowing an author has really thought about her characters and situations, and come up with some surprising and delightful detail that makes the whole reading experience fuller. Lively details, you understand -- pointless details are a nightmare to read. I don't need to know that Bella ate a granola bar for breakfast. I REALLY DON'T. (Notice that I remembered the granola bar. I think this is partly because I was fervently hoping it would have significance. Like, she would spectacularly choke on her oatmeal the next day and think, ""AH, I should have had a granola bar like yesterday!"")""Show, don't tell"" is not the be-all-and-end-all of writing. There's a little thing called summary narrative. It's beautiful; it facilitates plot progression without having to follow your narrator through 24-fucking-hours of a day... and ""watch"" as she eats a fucking granola bar for breakfast.I've seen this novel accused of Mary Sue-ism and um, yeah, any character named Isabella Swan seems destined to be a Mary Sue. But honestly, I wouldn't begrudge a semi-autobiographical story if it actually had any of the realism of autobiography. All the high school/teenage stuff honestly made me boggle. Because... that's not what high school is like! That's not what being seventeen is like! Twilight reads like... well, it reads like a thirtysomething who has no recollection of being 17. Bella has all the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old and that's just not remotely believable. Meyer is not a bad writer. She has the ability to string words together. Unfortunately, she lacks any kind of flair. There was no original description; no truly evocative language. Twilight reads like Meyer has read a lot of mediocre novels and regurgitated the same kind of language onto the page. There is just nothing exciting to the language. The dialogue is awful: not only uninspiring and lacking in wit, but... it's all the same! There's no difference in speech patterns to the characters; no awareness of personal tics. The characterization is wafer-thin (see above, re: Mary Sue). The plotting is terrible: the novel trundles along at a slow pace for 250 pages and then Meyer seems to suddenly realize she needs a climax and the gears shift abruptly and the reader is caught up in a series of ridiculous contrivances that set up Meyer's final set-piece (which, by the way, I saw coming a mile away).This is such a profoundly antifeminist novel. And it's funny, because I think Meyer has no idea that it's antifeminist. I mean, she has a female heroine! A heroine who reads Austen and writes essays about misogyny in Shakespeare! Surely she's kicking butt for all womankind. Um... no. She cooks, she cleans, she looks after the man in her life! She needs male characters to protect her from the big, bad, scary world! She falls headfirst into a disturbingly dysfunctional relationship with a man 90 years her senior without the slightest amount of worry!Seriously. Bella/Edward. What's that all about? I don't get the attraction. He has her in his thrall. She is, let me quote, ""unconditionally and irrevocably"" in love with him -- and after, like, a week. o__O She's consumed by him; she's willing to sacrifice her life for him, and that's... romantic? I just think it's a bit sick, really. You know what I find romantic? Human warmth. Not sweeping, dramatic statements of everlasting and overarching love. Little, sweet moments of connection that ring true. That's something Twilight's apparently epic love story is sorely lacking in. (Did I say Bella has the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old? Well, except when it comes to Edward. There she has the emotional maturity of a dumb dog.)",2254,0.9967,0.076,0.744,0.18,0.607442489072924,NEGATIVE,1.0

""try to be careful in there,"" the chest giggled while at the same time giving me a sinister sideward glance that made the blood in the veins under my skin in my body feel ice-cold.""haha,"" i giggled, tapping the chest on its rippling pectorals. ""very funny,"" i then said running my finger around his kennedy-half-dollar sized nipples.

New week,  New BookTube Video - all about the best (and worst) literary couplesThe Written Review 
So, my review might be a bit biased...This was my first (and only major) episode of fangirling. I owned a tshirt (""vegetarian vampire""  - so edgy). I saw the first movie an embarrassingly high number of times in theater. I judged people based off of Team Edward or Team Jacob (for the record: Edward in the books, Jacob in the movies).Even now, more than 10 years later, I still absolutely adore this first book - there's too many good feelings. I tried so, so hard to look at this book with my sophisticated grown-up eyes, to see past all the trite plotholes and develop a good, sound hatred of Twilight . I just can't - I live for this series. So, just keep in mind where I am coming from when I decided to reread this one. My overwhelming realization? Bella should probably be hospitalized There is no way she doesn't have some inner-ear or traumatic brain injury. There is no physically relevant way a seventeen year old could be that 
unbalanced.
  It defies all logic. It's like every time I turned the page, there'd she go. Falling. Again.
You really should stay away from me.
The other overwhelming realization? Rosalie was the voice of reason. I remember absolutely 
hating her
 because she was the only one who stood between Edward and Bella. How dare she not love that they're in love? Well, now that I'm older, it's more of 
 YOU'RE ONLY SEVENTEEN AND HE'S A HUNDRED YEARS OLDER.
 Team Rosalie-the-voice-of-reason all the way.Despite everything, the cheesy quotes, the terribly unrealistic portrayal of love and the big sparkling plot-holes, I can't help it. 
I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.Me, falling in love with this book all over again.

6,9387130,11/21/2007,3.0,"I actually had to give this book three separate reviews by three sides of my personality. My three-star rating is the median of the three:Review 1, by My Inner Fifteen Year Old Girl (5 stars):Bella is smart, funny, well-read, pretty and yet misunderstood by most of her peers (just like me). Then she meets a cool, hot guy who turns out to be a good vampire, and he can do really cool things, like run fast and stop cars with his hands, but he's still sweet and wonderful. It's ultimate wish-fulfillment fantasy -- what's not to like? Meyers can make your heart speed up with some of the tense, tortured ""we must be together/no, what if i hurt you"" pg-13 erotica.Review 2, by My Fan of YA Lit (3 Stars):Meyers can tell a pretty good story, when she lets herself actually tell it -- the book starts out well, and would have been a bit more interesting if I hadn't known he was a vampire all along. Then it slows down during the long ""getting to know you"" dialogue exchanges between Edward and Bella -- there's no plot, just back-story and exposition disguised as conversations, and far too many ""I can't be with you, I don't want to hurt you!"" ""But I love you, I don't care about danger!"" back-and-forths. When the evil vamps show up, however, the story kicks back in and the end is quite exciting. When Meyers isn't dwelling on how perfectly angelic Edward is (again!) she can get the pages turning. Since there are A LOT of pages to turn, I wish she would have infused that urgency into the story more often. While abandoning most of the conventional cliches of vampire-lore (stakes, sunlight, garlic, coffins) she keeps all the modern-vamp-romance cliches (alabaster skin, good hair, expensive taste in clothes, tragically distant), and adds a few of her own unfortunate twists (vampires avoid the sun because it makes them sparkle, the good-vamp clan play some extreme version of baseball in a scene that was far too Quidich-y for my taste). Too many cliches or trying to hard to be original -- somehow both criticisms are accurate.Review 3, by My Inner Feminist (1 Star):Meyers describes Bella as being strong, brave, and independent, but then shows her as a spineless, cowering victim who needs to be saved by her violently jealous and over-protective boyfriend. She constantly goes on and on about how Edward is perfect at everything and how he's so gorgeous and she is so unworthy of him, how he's so strong and he protects her. In fact, she never gives any reason for liking him other than how hot he is, but that's fair because Edward never gives a reason for liking her other than she smells good. He is frustrated that Bella is the only person whose thoughts he can't read, so he eavesdrops on her friends minds to find out what they talk about, he follows her whenever she leaves her house, and he secretly camps outside her room when she sleeps - that doesn't sound sweet, it sounds creepy. If girls want a romantic, conflicted vampire/human romance, they should go watch the firs three seasons of Buffy -- not only is there the dark, mysterious, conflicted vampire, but the girl he's in love with can kick some serious ass all on her own.",1965,0.9964,0.123,0.67,0.207,0.6247336377473365,POSITIVE,0.7306

To her surprise, she gains almost instant popularity at her new high school—with the exception of the beautiful Edward Cullen and his siblings, who either ignore her, or in the case of Edward himself, seem to be repulsed by her. Even though the reader probably knows going in that at least part of what's going on relates to Edward being a vampire (because it says in BIG LETTERS ON THE BACK that Edward is a vampire), it's still fun to speculate about what exactly is going on—why does Edward seem both drawn and repelled by Bella? Why does he save her life? What are a bunch of vampires doing impersonating students at a small town high school, anyway?Unfortunately, the answers to all these questions seem to be either nonexistent or extremely lame. Edward reacts weirdly to Bella because she 1) smells unusually good, and 2) is the only person he's ever met whose mind he cannot read. No. 1 apparently makes him fall in love with her, while the reasons behind No. 2 are never explained. But, you know, the actual mysterious stuff is apparently not important—instead it's more important that we realize that the Cullens are good vampires, who only eat animals, and who do nice, all-American things like play baseball in the woods. Okay! Also, all the weaknesses you've heard vampires have are just myths. Garlic, stakes, even sunlight—no problemo. Yet Edward would never even consider turning Bella, because that would make her an Evil Thing. Oh, and they also can't have sex, presumably because Meyer once read ""Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex"" (and/or is a Mormon. Sorry).Instead, what Edward and Bella apparently CAN do is be very emo and teenage about their twu luv (despite Edward actually being over 100 years old), and be threatened by a villain that shows up in the novel's last third just to give it some semblance of an actual plot. Then, once all is well, they go to the prom! SERIOUSLY. THE BOOK ENDS WITH EDWARD TAKING BELLA TO THE PROM. What. The. Fuck.And still, none of this answers my number one question: if you were a century-old vampire, why the HELL would you spend your time going to high school in Washington State? (Especially when you're not even trying to bang high school girls.) Angel at his most pathetic emo mopiness had more spine.",573,0.829,0.08,0.822,0.099,0.4852658662092625,NEGATIVE,0.9194

Welcome to Part II of the Vampire Compatibility Test (VCT). Before we continue, let's briefly racap Part I of the VCT. Your score in Part I should have given you a good idea of how critically you judge vampire fiction, placing you in either ""Group A"" or ""Group B"" based on overall points scored. Group A: A fairly harsh to extremely harsh critic that requires in a vampire story that it be: (a) well written or at least highly engaging prose; (b) tightly plotted with a well defined backstory that is either tied to an established “vampire mythos” or adds something substantial to the vampire genre; and (c) an intelligent, compelling original story or a slick, fast-paced, chill-filled thrill ride. Group B: Includes those that are not too critical and are generally okay as long as the writing and plot are not horrible and there is “something about it” that makes it an interesting diversion. This group also includes those that are not sure what the word critic means. So with Part I completed, we now turn to Part II of the VCT test. In this section, we will take a look at the most popular vampire series in publishing history (i.e., the Twilight series) and help you determine whether it is a good choice for your next reading selection**. **(PLEASE NOTE: If you are part of ""Group A"" above than the answer is clearly NO, and you can move on immediately to Part III of the VCT.) For those in Group B, here are the instructions for this section of the VCT. For each of the 4 questions below, select the answer that best describes your personal taste when it comes to vampire fiction. Each answer has a corresponding point value that will be added up at the end of the test. The total number of points will indicate a preference for a certain kind of vampire novel, which can then be used to assist you in selecting the right story for you.  QUESTION 1: Which of the following best describes your favorite kind of vampire? A: Sparkly, epically EMO and unable to look threatening without legal counsel and a tactical nuke; 0 points B: Underwear model hotness with perfect hair who smells like the beach and has eyes that can cause a person’s naughty bits to spontaneously combust. 5 points C: Chalky skin, “super cuts” hair, stylistically challenged clothing (with or without Liberace cape) with long nails, ivory fangs and a kick ass accent. 10 points    D. Ugly and reeking of ickyness with deformed monster-like physical appearance and sharp, nasty animal-like teeth and claws. Note: long black tongue like appendages is optional. 15 points E. So freaking menacing and “out of this world” disgusting that sightings will cause spontaneous development of Tourette Syndrome, loss of bladder and temporary voice immodulation. 20 points   QUESTION 2: Which of the following best describes your desire to become a vampire like those in your favorite stories? A. YES, YES, oh my God, oh my God, YES…YES…YES…YES…YES….YEEEESSSSS

 0 points B. Yes, I think it would be pretty cool.  5 points C. Close, but no. I think the loneliness, lack of Vitamin D and dietary restrictions outweigh the longevity and the cool, soulful hipness. 10 points D. No way, I would rather die than become one of those things. 15 points E. ARE YOU FUCKING PSYCHO? Not only would I rather die but I would personally hogtie my best friends and leave them for the creatures to munch on while I made good my escape. 20 points QUESTION 3: Which of the following best describes how you would respond if a casual acquaintance asked you if they should check out the popular “Twilight” series by Stephenie Meyer? A. I would say YES because it is the best book since Crime and Punishment, no wait, the BEST BOOK EVER and everyone should read it. 0 points B. I would say YES, but would spend the next 20 minutes qualifying my answer using phrases like: “well, some people find it kinda cheesy” and “it’s not exactly quality prose” and “you should know that I’m pretty forgiving of the plot because I just LOVE the characters” and “don’t fucking look at me like that. I mean, it sold like a gagillion copies so it can’t be all bad.” 5 points C. Even though I really like it, I would be too embarrassed to admit that I read it and would tell the person NO and that they should to read Ulysses instead because “it is like way deep and shit.” 10 points D. I would say NO and tell them to go read Dracula because it’s an excellent Vampire story!! 15 points E. I would stare at them stunned for several seconds and then bitch slap them hard across the face for asking me such a dumb shit question, screaming that vampires DO NOT sparkle, wear hair gel or play baseball....EVER!!! 20 pointsQUESTION 4: If they made a major hollywood movie of your favorite vampire movie, what rating would the MPAA give it?A. PG to PG-13 for EMO Adult situations, snarky Adult language and boring violence. 0 pointsB. PG-13 for strong sexual situations, strong sexual situations and strong to very strong sexual situations. 5 pointsC. R for Adult language, sweet, bloody violence, fright and nudity followed by bimbo deaths. 10 pointsD. NC-17 to banned in the U.S. for almost continuous gore on a massive scale, vampires more disgusting than a SUMO wrestler's bowel movement and.......lots and lots of nudity because WHY NOT. 15 pointsSCORING FOR PART II OF VCT:0 to 10 points. Ignore the 1 star rating above, buy ""first printings"" of all four of the Twilight books and read them over and over until your eyes bleed. 15 to 20 points. Twilight is probably a 2 star read and you might think about squeezing it in between episodes of “Jersey Shore.”25 to 50 points. Best to skip Twilight as it is not likely to be a memorable read for you. 50 points or over. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Twilight is your vampire kryptonite and reading it will make you think less of yourself and may cause severe and long lasting anger and/or depression at the current state of the world.

14,736712876,10/08/2013,2.0,"Call me crazy, but Twilight wasn't that bad. Well, sure, it's bad, but it's not 1-star bad. The sequels were atrocious, sure, but the first book wasn't the worst crap I've ever read. What I suspect most of us hate about Twilight isn't the book itself, but the legion of rabid, terrifying fangirls. The ones debating on online forums about Team Edward vs. Team Jacob. The ones who will argue that Twilight is the best book ever written. The ones who camp out at Twilight movie premieres 1 month before opening day. The ones who post YouTube videos of themselves sobbing their heart out when Rpattz and Kstew broke up irl. I hate the fans. I desperately hate the rabid fangirlzzz. There aren't enough words to describe my loathing of Twitards. The book itself wasn't that bad. I've read far worse before. I will read far worse in the future. I've read books that I wish were paper so that I could fling it across the room during a fit of rage. I've read books with alpha-douches who have made me use curse words that have made a Navy sailor blush. I've read books where the love interest is as abusive asshole who would think nothing of commenting on his love interest's tits or weight. And these books aren't even new adult. I've read books where the main character is a rampant fellow-girl hater and slut shamer. I've read books where the main character is so fucking dumb it makes my teeth hurts. I've read books where the main character seems to be doing her damnedest to remove herself from the human gene pool and it is only by the grace of deus ex fucking machina that she is saved. I've read books whose plot makes Game of Thrones seem simple, and not in the ""Wow, that's really complex"" kind of way as it is ""What the actual fuck were you smoking when you wrote this?"" kind of way. So in that sense, Twilight is really not that bad. Sure, Bella is dumb and a Mary Sue, but the worst you can say about her is that she is completely colorless and bland, with the personality of a block of tofu. The worst you can say about Edward is that he's a weirdo stalker who likes really young girls despite his age, but man, watching a girl while she sleeps? He's been out-creeped by far worse men. So really. I mean it. You may hate Twilight with my blessing, but please don't believe it's the worst example of YA literature out there. Is isn't, by any stretch of the imagination.

""ballet bar"", ""dust moats"", ""had been belonged to me"". OMFG SRSLY stephenie, you can't afford a copy editor?? and while we are at it - your name is also a typo. and there is so much chuckling and tooth grinding and fist balling (heh) and jaw clenching it seems like a ticcy nicolas cage movie at times. and the repetition of words for edward; ""beautiful"" and ""heavenly"" and ""sublime"" and ""perfect"" ""perfect"" ""perfect"". christmas wishlist: a thesaurus for stephenie.but more than that.from what i had heard - the big complaint about this book was bella. i was expecting some vapid, swoony, clumsy, clingy, weak little thing who was a terrible role model for the young misses and a blight upon the face of womynhood. but she is actually pretty badass. she drives a massive truck and is good at science and likes to read and hates the prom and is pretty fearless and would hook a finger in your eye and pop it out instead of running away if she felt threatened. i can get behind that. so what are the complaints actually about?? her selfless devotion to edward; her willingness to sacrifice and surrender herself for a boy. a vampire. a much older man. a creature known for its powers of mesmerism and allure.the ultimate bad boy.well, duh! this is precisely how it feels to be a 17-year-old girl deeply in love. it's fight, kill, or die for your beloved. see, i was one, so i can speak to the phenomenon firsthand. and from here on out, if it makes you feel more comfortable; if you have a problem with sweeping generalities, when i use the phrase ""17-year-old-girl"", feel free to substitute ""karen t. brissette""17-year-old girls are drawn to the bad boy17-year-old girls in love do not think, they feel17-year-old girls are dangerously self-absorbed (when ""self"" includes the beloved because they are one soul etc etc) 17-year-old girls do not give one shit about what kind of example they are setting for others of their gender17-year-old girls are all too inclined to sacrifice,to become a martyr for their love, to believe in the magic of the world and the power of infatuation, and to risk it all to prolong that infatuation17-year-old girls lack cynicism and have no real frame of reference yet or any extensive battle scars, or relationship track record; everything is here and now and the most important thing in the history of the world.so, yeah, bella, i get you. you are not a victim. and your clumsiness (and mine) are very endearing.as is your commitment. i once walked miles barefoot on the summer blacktop to show my devotion to mine, he pulled equally stupid demonstrative stunts - there were blowups and reconciliations and third-party interventions and i became love and it was wonderful, mercurial, mad mad mad.so,yeah, bells, i get your depth of feeling.forget team edwardforget team jacobi am resoundingly team bella.and i was also told this was one of the most erotic novels of all time, by my most favorite professor, and i rolled my eyes at the time, thinking ""why does everyone like this damn book so much??""but you know what?? she was right. this is totally virgin porn. straight up sweaty virgin porn.and of course, all vampire lit is porn, where the bloodsucking stands in for the sex act etc etc. but what if both parties are acting against nature/their inclinations?he is repressing his desire to drink her bloodshe is repressing her desire to touch himboth feel the strain of resistance and every time they are close - there is amazing heightened tension.and it is - it is pretty damn hot.hoofa.so, yeah, like cottage cheese, i have come around in my thinking about this book. but i refuse to give this a star rating. let me hold on to that much of my pride.come to my blog!",428,0.9974,0.12,0.694,0.186,0.6438013136288997,NEGATIVE,1.0

17,2508204512,09/20/2018,2.0,"I genuinely can’t believe I finished this book, and I don’t mean that in an offhand, wow, what a garbage fire sort of way. I mean that I’m actually fucking surprised that I managed to turn the last page of this and not immediately die of organ failure. And then my sister would have to come and break down my front door and find me contorted on my bed in my crusty old pyjamas with Dorito dust under my fingernails, and morticians would have to break my bones to pry this book out of my cold dead hands, and I’d need to come back as a ghost years later and write “It was for science” in lipstick on the bathroom mirror just to clear my name. In the year of our lord 20gayteen, it’s difficult to offer any sort of fresh or remotely nuanced critique on Twilight without resorting to edgelord tactics, like declaring that it’s a feminist read or that it was all an imaginary coping mechanism constructed by Bella to make returning to the shite little town of Forks bearable. But I think our judgement has been clouded for the past ten to twelve years - at least mine has, by the endless slew of stale “still a better love story” memes and the constant personal jabs aimed at Stephenie Meyer by mainstream media. There’s also the YA scene’s insidious desire to erase all memory of it from genre history: when I was doing research for this review, I found this video in which multiple YA authors explain what their influences were for writing female-centric YA stories, and not one of them mentions Twilight, which… Whoa. Like, that’s astounding to me. It's just disingenuous as fuck, that they had the gall to brazenly omit Stephenie Meyer from their credit lines, particularly when one or more of them started their careers in paranormal YA on the tail of the Twilight boom. Even this video, which claims to illustrate the history of YA, downplays Twilight's influence on the genre. YA existed before Twilight, of course, but it baffles me when the YA industry now slaps its hands to its ears and la-la-las over the indisputable truth: YA was a marginalised genre before the Twilight phenomenon. Was it a coincidence that YA paranormal romance exploded upon the rising popularity of Twilight? You could argue that it was, of course, and you’re entitled to your wrong opinion, but I did not unironically Google “Edward Cullen star sign” for you hoes to come at me with “what about Catcher in the Rye”. Fuck Catcher in the Rye. I’m not explaining that opinion any further and not will I defend it. Fuck that book and fuck all of its smug knock-offs, because if you polish a turd it’s still a turd. I'm sorry, but I don't make the rules.  The basic breakdown is this: I enjoyed this book, and I mean I genuinely enjoyed it, and was invested, until about the halfway mark. After that, it was impossible for me to ignore the cloying creepiness that perverts a sweet and tender love story into something that, as an adult, is difficult for me to justify. When I was 13, I was a stan for Twilight, but not because of the books - I had only seen the movies, and for this reason it feels like a missed opportunity, because I can’t accurately compare my feelings then to my feelings now. This inaccuracy stems mostly from the fact that the movies were a farce that in no way capture the spirit of the characters or any of the relationships between them. It’s because of the movies that this series is the focus of such intense ridicule and hatred in the media; it’s the self-seriousness of the movies that’s so infuriating, because while the book is melodramatic and depressing, it’s light and jubilant where the movie isn’t. My main problem with the media’s perception of the series is that it’s based entirely on this self-seriousness, and in particular Kristen Stewart’s dead eyes. The truth is that Book Bella and Movie Bella are two starkly different people, and you can fucking fight me on this. It doesn’t surprise me that Stephenie Meyer is over it and has Moved On, because if I was her, I would genuinely be bitter as fuck, the most poisonous bitch, an actual Viṣakanyā, not only for the unstoppable barrage of media abuse but also for the forced image of my creative work as something completely separate from what it is. Meyer has weathered a barrage of criticism for her Mormon lifestyle, and this has bled into her storytelling, and to an extent I agree, because heavy-handed morality is an easy way to drop a story down a U-bend. However, while Meyer’s inherent religious biases have centred heteronormativity and gender-based parameters, it may run deeper than this. The artery of conflict that threads through each book in the series is opposing ideals within the central relationship, and if we look at these characters as theological models, their connection does boast a bit more nuance: Edward is Mormonism and Bella is modernism, thus their relationship is a wrestle between starkly defined historical values and modern flexibility. To explore this model, it's worth analysing each character as an individual, not both as a unit (we'll get to that later). My impression of Bella is that she's confident in familiar situations and, contrary to common criticism, mostly generated from the appallingly weak and lifeless character in the movies, is not defined by low self-esteem. When several boys ask her out to the dance she never defaults to this modest cry of, “who, me?”; she’s weary of the attention, and shrugs off her pursuers by diverting their romantic efforts to her single friends (with whom she shares close, if superficial bonds, to be expected from people who haven't had much time to get to know each other outside of school). She never shrinks away from male attention, and while she does often acknowledge that Edward is aesthetically pleasing, her reaction to being seen with a ""dazzling"" and notorious man is a natural one: “Won’t people wonder why someone so special is out with someone so ordinary, like me?” This is not a new or particularly groundbreaking question to ask oneself, especially in young and emotionally charged relationships, and especially with someone like Bella, who is defined by her low-key and utilitarian outlook, and her discomfort with an excess of attention in social circles. Bella mentions that she was not popular in Arizona, but for defined reasons: She is not sporty or excessively outgoing, which the book lays out as defining traits of most Arizonans (as a non-American, I’m unable to confirm this as truth or condemn it as a false stereotype, but the author does live in Arizona). She also states that her last school was densely populated which, naturally, provides an ease of anonymity. Her move to Forks batters her with the scrutiny of the tight-knit community, due for the most part to her mother’s vaguely sordid reputation as “the Chief’s flighty ex-wife” (12), the Chief being Charlie, a trusted pillar of the community. Renée’s notoriety as an ex-Forks resident, an elusive outsider who left the town in her dust - an uncommon novelty - marks her as a kind of traitor to the community, and by extension, Bella shares this burden. Even without considering her mother’s impact on Forks’ social circle, Bella invites attention as a rare new face among a close circle of scandal-starved teens. Again and again, Bella is verbally lashed for a lack of personality or strong voice, but while Bella’s narration is introspective, this doesn’t strip her of personality (I mean it; this criticism is repeated ad nauseam). She’s a quiet, orderly girl who respects authority and values her studies, as much a cliché of its time as the “strong female protagonist” that has haunted YA for the past six years and has launched an oftentimes distasteful attack on traditional femininity, creating a dichotomy between “strong girl” and “weak girl"". But Bella can’t be neatly categorized with her knock-offs: she forfeited her happy, sunny life in Arizona for her mother’s benefit, a notably selfless choice, and not a courtesy that her mother necessarily deserves. Renée's neglectful parenting is often brushed aside as she hounds Bella via email and phone, creating an unsavoury illusion of parental concern. In reality, Renée is immature and self-involved, leaving bills unpaid and the fridge bare, darting off to pursue an unsustainable life on the road while she has a dependent minor at home. This is commented on in a particularly telling passage wherein Bella is concerned about leaving her “erratic, harebrained mother” (4) to fend for herself: “Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost” (4). It's a troubling role reversal that plays out in a similar, albeit softer, fashion when Bella moves in with her father and is immediately forced to take on basic duties in the home, due to her father’s ineptitude in the kitchen and in homemaking. But Bella is an independent girl who doesn’t want to shoehorn her mother into the same situation that she fled in Forks, so she moves away to stay with her father purely for Renée’s benefit. But her relationship with Charlie is tender: when Tyler’s truck nearly crushes her, she’s thinking fondly of her father, who got up early to put snow chains on the wheels of her truck. It’s the same sort of quiet thoughtfulness that defines Bella. When people like Jacob and Angela are being sidelined by their friends - ignored during a group conversation - Bella notices this and acknowledges them. Bella’s personality is quiet, but I wouldn't call it weak. (It's worth remembering that, in 2005, a ""ladylike front"" was very much in fashion and not only in religious circles like Meyer's. This ""touch my butt and buy me pizza"" attitude didn't come into fashion until Tumblr became mainstream, and until the internet popularised the Anna Kendrick brand. You know, this ""I'm a gross girl and I wear sweatpants and I like to swear"". That mentality wasn't part of the media hive mind yet.)Is this what catches Edward’s attention? In part, yes. Though more prominently it’s Bella’s mystery that attracts Edward. He can’t read her mind, thus their courtship requires rituals, wooing, a thrill that is missing entirely from Edward’s life. I mentioned in my status updates that I had a lot of feelings about Edward, his past and his pain, and to an extent I do; it’s another missed opportunity, because Edward’s past is handwaved, even though it influences every facet of his questionable behaviour, from his total lack of awareness about road safety, to his absurd and oftentimes bewildering fascination with Bella’s average life. Here’s the thing about Edward: he’s either too old or too young, depending on how you look at it. He was born on the cusp of living memory, which means that in 2005, he’s the same age as some people’s great grandparents, and this is what makes his relationship with Bella unacceptable. He’s not a relic, like Carlisle, or merely an older man. He is geriatric, and this adds an element of unavoidable perversion to his romance with a teenage girl. With a clear mind, it’s almost impossible not to recoil when Edward describes Bella as “appallingly luscious” or during this exchange: “‘That’s probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.’I brindled a little at the word child. ‘Jacob is not that much younger than I am,’ I reminded him.He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. ‘Oh, I know,’ he assured me with a grin.” (305)If we look at this from Carlisle’s point of view, then it becomes apparent that Edward’s age was a huge narrative blunder. Carlisle is 362, and if we sit back and contemplate the enormity of that, and the sheer gulf between him and someone who is seventeen, then it almost wouldn’t be so bad if Edward were also old as balls: he could be considered something other entirely, not an elderly man but a creature from another world, wholly divorced from Bella’s insular world. It would be as if she had fallen in love with an alien, or some eldritch beast from a parallel universe. It would require a lot more effort on Meyer's part to explain exactly what it is that makes their relationship hold together, and the politics between them would be more complex, but this would arguably have made for a more cerebral read. (Conversely, this is why I struggle to fully get on board with Outlander. Granted, I've only seen the TV show, but how could Claire and Jamie possibly find anything to talk about that's remotely relevant to either of their lives? He's never seen a bean can and he doesn't know what the telly is.) But ageing Edward up could, with some moral gymnastics and a constant reminder that Yes, This Is Weird, But We’re Going With It, remove him from Bella’s socio-political sphere just enough that it would almost be more acceptable.It's the poor decision to time Edward's birth at the beginning of the 20th century that really hits the nail into the coffin here. While it does comfortably serve the theological dichotomy between Edward and Bella (anyone significantly older would probably not be Mormon, as Mormonism wasn't a thing until the early-to-mid 1800s) it is a stumbling block for the believability of the romance. The movie and the book both struggle desperately to reconcile Edward’s point of view with Bella’s, neither one with enough sleight of hand to properly explore the intricacies of it; that said, at least in the book, Edward is fun:“‘You scared me for a minute there,’ [Edward] admitted after a pause… ‘I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.’‘Ha, ha.’ I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. ‘Honestly—I’ve seen corpses with better colour. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.’‘Poor Mike. I bet he’s mad.’‘He absolutely loathes me,’ Edward said cheerfully.” (85)In the movie, it’s impossible to understand why the hell this old man is chasing after this little girl, but in the book he’s charming and eloquent, and there are instances that beget genuine empathy—I couldn’t stop thinking about Edward’s total disregard for his own personal safety, his exclusion from society, this insular environment that Carlisle’s bite condemned him to. He is an old man caged in the body of a teenager, and his family only enables his self-destructive behaviour. I wouldn’t even call him a pervert: I would call him someone who is so psychologically damaged from a physical assault that he is clawing desperately to human affection to try to manufacture a sense of normalcy in his life. And Carlisle, his attacker, is now his sole benefactor, the puppeteer of a collection of ageless marionettes that obey his authority over their household. They survive at Carlisle’s pleasure; they play by his rules. But Edward states that the vampires do not sleep, and while sleep is necessary for growth and repair, it’s also vital for mental health. What has this created in Carlisle, a man who hasn’t slept in around 340 years? Is there any way to measure the psychological damage this could cause, or are we seeing it now in this strange, macabre puppet show that is the Cullen clan?Is this an intentional angle? It’s hard to say. I doubt it, but I don’t think there’s such a thing as “reading too much” into stories, especially those that deal with extremely weighty topics such as immortality and love and pack mentality. What strikes me most here is that Bella is a victim of the Cullen clan, but so is Edward, and of course Rosalie. Edward, Rosalie, and Esme were all turned by Carlisle without their consent, and while they all were dying, and though this is passed off as noble by Carlisle, it doesn’t ring true. As asserted by the narrative, the “lawless” vampires, i.e. those who do not belong to a ""safe"" clan and who are not under the control of any other entity, and who hunt humans, are the villains of this story, but what makes them villainous is their disregard for human life, and that they justify this by citing their natural instincts. The vampires’ natural attractiveness, their smell, and their heightened senses all function for ease of hunting, and the Cullens are not exempt; the difference between them is that the ungoverned vampires hunt humans, and the Cullens do not. Or do they?Perhaps what Carlisle did can’t be labelled “hunting”, but it could be something worse. It could be the ultimate act of power and control, to stockpile living bodies, to use acts of brutality and violence to manufacture close familial bonds. Carlisle professes not to have given in to his baser instincts, but the truth may be that he did, not by killing but with a cultivated community of psychological torture. Edward states that Carlisle was lonely, but the problematic element to this is that Carlisle knew why he was lonely - it was because immortality made him that way. His solution to this was to condemn other people to the same fate. One could ask why Carlisle was so certain that the other “Cullens” would bond with him, but my answer to this is that Carlisle made it that way: this was his design, to collect a trove of ghosts and lock them behind the doors of his estate. The Cullens will always be connected by the things that make them “other”, and in the end, so will Bella. She will become a Cullen too, but I’d say it’s not Edward’s fingers that are plucking her puppet strings. Is James the villain here? Perhaps. Perhaps not. This is a new prototype for my review layout and I'm hoping to create more graphics/interactive content in the future.

21,3621240772,11/01/2020,2.0,"Hello, I have a little disclaimer. Someone plagiarized this review and has been posting comments on other people's reviews saying things like, ""check out my review of Twilight for laughs."" However, that review was simply my review, with one or two words changed (ex: ""fool"" was changed to ""clown""). I believe they are rewriting their review right now after my friends called them out. But honestly, I feel betrayed. I just wanted to let you all know so that if you see someone with a Twilight review that looks exactly like mine... well, it's probably them. Please don't plagiarize!And now, the review._____We need to leave Twilight alone. Twilight gets too much hate, most of which stems from the fact that it's geared towards teenage girls, and society as a whole has so much contempt for teenage girls. Everything they do is wrong. If they like boy bands and selfies and Tik Tok, they're too girly. If they don't, they're trying too hard to be ""not like other girls."" The fact remains that there are worse books. There are SO MANY worse books out there. And yet Twilight becomes the subject of hate. Yes, it's problematic in ways. Yes, it's not quality literature. But neither is Cinder, whose fans are literally everywhere I look (I cannot go a day without finding one). Neither is The Selection, which, despite encouraging insane levels of girl-on-girl hate and misogyny, is widely regarded as a ""guilty pleasure."" So why Twilight?I'm not going to attempt to answer this question, because I'm not an intellectual, but I have a theory.I believe it's because of how teenage-y it is. It's geared towards teenage girls, which automatically means it's trashy in the eyes of many. You have the sparkly buff actors, the questionable romantic dialogue, the not like other girls-ness. It's an easy book to hate on.It would be a different matter if the series pretended to be some feminist, deep piece of literature. But it's not and it never claims to be that. It's just a slightly ditzy paranormal romance and wish fulfillment. However, many individuals still like to mock this book for being the worst YA literature has to offer. These people clearly can't see past their own noses. There is so much garbage out there, unfortunately. Twilight just happens to be the scapegoat. Obviously, the misogynistic undertones don't age all that well, and the writing is so dull, but is it that bad? No. (I rated this 1.5 stars. I obviously have no love for the series. But really? People need to calm down and give Twilight a break.) The Beginning (Forks → oh wow look a vampire)Meet Bella Swan, the least interesting person ever to grace the pages of a book. She has no hobbies (well, she occasionally reads Jane Austen, but that doesn't count), half a brain cell, and a bland personality that sometimes abruptly turns into reckless selflessness.We're also introduced to a writing style so unbearably bland and lacking in any sort of lyrical quality whatsoever. This happened. Then this happened. Bella went to the grocery store. Then she drove home and took a shower. She put on a brown sweater. Then she sat on her bed and listened to metal while thinking about Edward's eyes.At one point, Edward calls Bella ""the opposite of ordinary,"" because that makes sense.Enter Edward Cullen, a mysterious boy who might also be a serial killer in his spare time. Bella is fascinated. Before long, she figures out that he's a vampire.First of all, how does that make any sense? Here's the evidence she has:1. Edward is pale.2. Edward never eats.3. Edward doesn't like the sun.4. Edward is beautiful. And somehow she gets from that to Edward's a vampire, what do you know! This is where her single half of a brain cell makes a leap of logic so bizarre it's almost funny. Possible explanations that actually make sense:1. Edward spends too much time in front of a computer.2. Edward burns easily. 3. Edward is anorexic. 4. Edward has food allergies. 5. Edward's parents are supermodels. So many explanations, and yet Bella goes straight to the supernatural. Don't ask me. I have no idea.I was tolerating this until the single most annoying element of all YA novels came in. The love triangle. Only it's not a triangle. It's a hexagon. Somehow, as soon as Bella walks into the school, five different boys are ✨infatuated.✨ Mike, Tyler, Eric, Edward, Jacob. For this girl with no personality, no hobbies, and no life. Hm. The Middle (I vant to suck your blood → I vatch you ven you sleep)This is where Bella's life begins to revolve around Edward. She thinks about him constantly. She visits him every day. She loses what little life she had in the first place.Not only is this clearly unhealthy, it's also kind of creepy. And I'm not talking about Bella's infatuation. (I think you all know where I'm getting here.) Edward reveals later on that he stalked Bella home every single night. Even before they were formally introduced. And, on some of those occasions, he broke in through her window to watch her sleep. *coughs awkwardly* If that's not creepy, I don't know what is. If I were Bella, I would call the police and get him hauled off to a nice, cold jail cell. But Bella, of course, is ✨in love.✨ Ah, yes. Stalkers. How romantic. The End (Meet the Cullens → the tracker) This begins to turn into a relationship that's far from equal. Apparently, Bella is totally incompetent and can never take care of herself. So Edward takes this as an excuse to follow her around, even to another city, to ""make sure she doesn't hurt herself."" Either Bella is that stupid, or Edward is that creepy. I think it's a combination of both factors.So Bella begins to rely on Edward. Obviously, that's not a good thing, because when relationships are unequal like that, they tend to fall apart quickly. You can't depend on one person for the rest of your life. Edward, who can do literally everything better than a normal person, is at an advantage in this relationship. This is clearly problematic. Edward is a control freak, and Bella is an incompetent fool who can't take care of herself. The only reason I would ship them together is just to get them out of the picture so Bella doesn't accidentally kill someone by tripping on them. I actually finished this book. All 500 pages of it. Please don't force me to read New Moon, fangirls. I can't take it any longer.1.5 starsPS: Please, please find help if a stranger is stalking you home every night.

22,23920442,06/07/2008,1.0,"Twilight is lame and stupid.I think everyone knows that the characters are essentially the ones who make up the book. It’s through them that the plot is developed, the conflicts are carried, the climax is revealed, stuff like that. And when you’re writing in a first person POV, you have to make that “first person” interesting and observant. Bella, our first person, is about as interesting as a rock. Isabella is nothing more than a Mary Sue. It doesn’t even take a genius to figure out that ‘Bella’ is Italian for ‘beautiful’. And her last name is ‘Swan’, which as a device in literature, symbolizes grace and beauty. Bella Swan? Beautiful Swan? Not very clever.Here’s the contradiction: She’s ordinary. At least that’s what she keeps on insisting throughout the book. Practically everyone in her new school asks her to the dance, or to the prom. And she gets the guy who apparently “doesn’t date” because “none of the girls… are good-looking enough for him.” Her appearance is somewhat similar to the author’s, as well as her story of moving to a new place. If it helps, she’s a klutz – a last ditching effort to not make her a complete Mary Sue.Most readers who like Twilight relate to Bella. Well I don’t. I can’t possibly relate to a young woman with no plans, no goals, no solid interests, no personality, no deep observations of life, no nothing - but is just “unconditionally and irrevocably in love with” her boyfriend. I really can’t. There’s something so shallow and pathetic about it; the way she’s willing to throw away her friends and family for a guy she has been acquainted with for just… two weeks? Besides, she is extremely boring, the sort which makes you fall asleep while she talks. And if she’s not obsessing over Edward, she does, well, nothing but whines, or tells him and his family that she doesn’t want to be rescued.I would have liked it if Meyer had given her a little backbone and some brain cells, so she can get out of the stupid situations she puts her stupid self in. I don’t buy her “I grew up in Phoenix” statement. Nobody who grew up in Phoenix would be an idiot enough to wander around empty streets of an unfamiliar city alone. Then again, her idiocy is necessary to give way to her savior, Edward Cullen.Edward is a vampire – oops! – a perfect vampire. He’s the most beautiful thing which ever existed… Have I mentioned that he’s perfect? And that he has topaz eyes? He’s also bipolar. He’s serious one time, and then laughs exuberantly another. Insane mood swings, I tell you. He’s supposed to be your perfect male protagonist – hawt!!! (not hot; it should be hawt and must always be followed by three exclamation points), dangerous, smart, mysterious, perfect, and, uhm, sparkly (although the last adjective is not really required; it’s just a bonus if you’re lucky enough). He has this stalker-ish behavior, which is sick: He sneaks into Bella’s room and watches her sleep before they even get to talk. Some think that it’s romantic, but it’s just creepy. I don’t understand what’s so romantic about it. Edward is 100-something years old and lives with his vampire family. Apparently he and his family don’t drink human blood, because they don’t want to be completely evil. They’re vegetarians: They only drink blood of animals. They are basically good vampires, and they also play baseball in the woods to pass the time. Also, every myth about vampire is WRONG! Stakes, garlic, sleeping in coffin (although the idea of not sleeping ever was okay) – even sunlight!But you know, age and race don’t matter in this book, because Edward and Bella actually fall in love! As for the reason… what is the reason again? Oh, because Bella smells good and Edward is hawt!!!. They’re made for each other! It’s destiny! Seriously, though, the romance between them is forced and trite. And it’s even more boring than they both are, because they have no personality whatsoever. I'm not even sure if there's romance at all. There is no development of feelings. Just… BAM! They’re in love! They don’t even do anything but talk about how in love they are. From there, everything becomes sheer selfishness, and for the nth time, stupidity. Bella’s life revolves around her boyfriend, and nothing more. Not only is it absurd; it also gives horrible messages, namely:1. It’s okay to fall in love in a matter of days and then risk your life for it.2. You don’t have to have dreams or goals or anything like that; just get a girl/boyfriend. It’s far more important!3. It’s perfectly fine to lie to your parents especially when it concerns your girl/boyfriend.4. Ditch your friends. Girl/Boyfriend first, I tell you! Girl/Boyfriend first!Considering the fact that Edward is so much older than Bella, shouldn’t he be more rational? More mature? Knowing he can kill Bella, he should have just left her alone. And how come Edward just blabbers everything to Bella? You know, the vampire stuff? For someone who has been in this world for more than a hundred years, he sure displays the maturity of a fetus.And he’s supposed to be dangerous. That could have worked, if only Bella had the wits to be actually scared. It’s funny; that girl’s so brainless you can’t possibly scare her! As for Edward, it would have been better if he had shown how dangerous he could be. I don't know, maybe good vampires can only talk about how dangerous they area instead of actually showing it.Oh, how could I forget! Edward SPARKLES UNDER THE SUN! Did you know that? Isn’t that cool? The coolest thing ever? It’s like the most magnificent thing next to Edward! He sparkles “like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface” of his skin! Sparkling! Glittering! Glistening! Scintillating! Oh! my! gosh! Meyer is so original! Who else could have thought that?!The plot is absolutely zero (the romance between Bella and Edward is not a plot). It’s basically just “He’s a vampire, she’s not. They fall in love. End of story.” And there were a lot of loopholes:1. Why would the Cullens want to study in high school?! This is my number one question. Hello? Who wants to go through high school over and over again??2. Why would they want to blend in with the rest of humanity?3. Why would they put themselves near humans when they know it’s hard to resist biting them?4. Why would one bad vampire like to bite Bella specifically?I’d like to answer and expand on loophole 4, because it’s absolutely preposterous. I didn’t even care about that James vampire when he appeared, because his arrival was so cliched and so late. It’s like Meyer suddenly remembered that there should be something climax-y in Twilight, just to give it a semblance of a plot. ""This James ought to do the trick. He should be the one to threaten Bella’s life and then she makes an insanely silly mistake and she almost gets killed BUT Edward rescues her!""Meyer’s writing style isn’t something to commend on either; she writes like a twelve-year old. She makes Dan Brown look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. Her words are stilted. The narration is unexciting, dragging, and redundant. Bella keeps telling the readers how much she hates the rain in the first 100 pages of the book, and how she can’t dance. If not that, she repetitively says how perfect and beautiful Edward is. What’s ironic is that despite all the perfect descriptions of him, I never quite pictured him in my mind. I’m still wondering how the rest of humanity can drool and squeal at the thought of him.Bella glares all the time, too. Bella also grimaces a lot, and hisses, and stumbles. Glares, grimaces, hisses, stumbles. Four redundant freakin’ verbs in a 500-page book. That’s not so much, unless you can count only to three. Meanwhile, Edward always smiles his crooked smile, and he dazzles people (especially Bella).Nobody ‘said’ anything. Characters only ‘gasped’, ‘chuckled’, ‘questioned’, and ‘answered’. Meyer also occasionally uses ridiculously long AND obscure words, which don’t quite fit since the rest of her words are plain and simple. I remember one: Ostentatious. She could have simply used ‘showy’ or ‘flamboyant’, but it just had to be ostentatious. Why she used that, I’ve no idea. (In the next books, Meyer uses bigger words. I wonder how big they are…)And you know, Meyer ends Twilight with Bella attending the PROM. That’s how a vampire story should end: The heroine should attend the prom with her vampire boyfriend. In that ruffled gown and stiletto heels… It just makes sense (although it did take Bella about ten years to figure out Edward is taking her to the prom. What an idiot). Meyer skipped the almost action-y part (Emmett and Jasper’s dealing with James) but she elaborates on the prom.Now that I’ve finished reading and dissecting Twilight, I still don’t understand all the hype it’s getting. It reads like a bad fan fic. I won't stop you from reading it, though. That's a choice for you to make.",326,0.9991,0.098,0.737,0.166,0.5765738513886667,NEGATIVE,1.0

24,20650233,04/21/2008,1.0,"Ok... I know that I'm going to offend a lot of people with this review, but I feel that I have to be honest about this. There are quite a few things that bother me about this book, I will only list the top 5 here:1) Bella - She is the exact character that I do NOT want my daughters to have as a role model. She is a sighing, swooning, fainting, weeping, weak female character straight out of the 19 century. This is the 21st century people! Do we want to raise a generation of namby pamby young women who can't stand on their own two feet?2) Edward - This is the kind of guy that I warn my daughters to stay away from. The guy sneaks into her room and watches her sleep. Does anyone else see anything creepy about this? He's obsessed with rescuing her and he thinks that if he doesn't follow her around 24/7 that she'll get herself into a dangerous situation that she can't handle. Does anyone else see anything creepy about this?3) The relationship - This is a textbook case of co-dependency if I ever saw one. They hardly know each other, but suddenly they can't live without each other? The dialogue is like something straight out of a Harlequin - ugh! I think that young people have enough trouble knowing the difference between love and lust and this book does not help.4) Too much emphasis on appearances - It's like Edward's good looks are all that matters, personality is not important. Bella must be good looking too, why else would a 100 year old vampire be interested in a 17 year old girl? Her personality leaves much to be desired so we know it's not that.5) The comparison between this series and the Harry Potter series - If I were J.K. Rowling I would be offended that people are comparing the Twilight series with the Harry Potter series. Stephani Meyer's writing is NOT up to par with J.K. Rowling - not even close.The worst thing about this book is that it's so hugely popular. There are thousands of young girls all over the nation who are swooning over Edward and wishing that they could be ""just like Bella"" - gag! I truly think that this book is a detriment to society.

26,80587994,04/01/2020,2.0,"Hey, friends! I’m going to keep it extremely honest with you and let you know that I feel like I need to practice writing in-depth reviews again. It’s been a while, and by a while I mean… it’s been since February. I am rusty, and not that confident, so I’m using my highlights and notes from a few rereads I did earlier this year to hopefully shake some of that rust off and regain a little confidence. Also, I always love a good breakdown. So, without further ado, here is the most chaotic SPOILER FILLED breakdown review for Twilight!

""And so the lion fell in love with the lamb…""

➽ Chapter 1:I completely had forgotten that this book just starts out with Bella Swan thinking about death (love some good foreshadowing), but basically, she is leaving Phoenix to live with her father in Forks. Forks, Washington is a small town where everyone knows everyone. Oh, also, Bella is 5’4” like me and I had a good giggle. [short rest]➽ Chapter 2:This is the chapter where Bella meets the elusive Edward Cullen, who doesn’t date. Also, the Withering Heights mention, get me out of here.➽ Chapter 3:The truck *accident* chapter, also we get to see Bella’s first dreams of Edward.➽ Chapter 4:Edward just officially won’t leave Bella alone now.➽ Chapter 5:“…but leave me alone… I’m bad” and “I’m dangerous!” he says to her! This is also the chapter with the lab prompt of them pricking their finger to figure out their blood types. But Bella gets sick, and Edward drives her home.➽ Chapter 6:Jacob Black finally enters the story, with the start of Stephenie Meyer’s questionable Native representation. They meet at the beach, where Jacob proceeds to tell Bella that Edward is a Vampire. Young Melanie truly didn’t remember it going down like that, and I have to laugh thinking back.➽ Chapter 7:NOT A FILIPINO VAMPIRE BEING IN THIS STORY! Please, God, help me. Also, a taro mention even. What did I do to ask for this representation? I truly think I blocked this out for my own health. Also, Bella is researching Vampires.➽ Chapter 8:Bella is going out with some girl friends (in a very het way) and she almost gets mugged. I truly had forgotten so much of this book. But also, the iconic mushroom ravioli is ordered for the first time in this chapter.➽ Chapter 9:Again, Edward continues to try to convince Bella he is dangerous by doing the very bare minimum. Bella proceeds to confess that she is in love with him.➽ Chapter 10:This chapter had the start of some very questionable disability representation, that was highkey very ableist. We also learn the secret that Edward can read minds, but not Bella’s because she is the opposite of ordinary and all.➽ Chapter 11:Edwards asks 500 questions, and Jacob comes back into the story for two seconds.➽ Chapter 12:Bella’s dad, Charlie, is going away on a fishing trip, so Bella can spend a lot more quality time with Edward without him knowing, even though he’s pretty horrible in this chapter. But we get to meet Alice and even in 2020 she is the only character deserving of rights, so we love that a lot. But the chapter ends with Bella using cold medicine to sleep. Oh, and we realize Edward is sparkly in this chapter! (How could I almost forget that?)➽ Chapter 13:Questionable drug analogy that made me extremely uncomfortable. But then Edward gives Bella a piggyback ride through the forest, and they have their first kiss that they feel drunk from. I am also pretty sure Edward tells Bella that he wanted to eat and kiss her before he kisses her. Smooth, baby.➽ Chapter 14:Edward just randomly starts talking about his jealousy and how he watches her sleep and likes when she says his name while sleeping. Bella takes in all this information being presented and asks him if they could get married.➽ Chapter 15:Bella gets to go to Edward’s house, and he tells her his backstory.➽ Chapter 16:We learn how Carlisle Cullen came to meet Edward and how he saved him. Again, Alice is the best Cullen and best Twilight character.➽ Chapter 17:The famous vampire baseball chapter! Also, some proclaiming of love, but then people start coming to their secret forest field!➽ Chapter 18:They want Bella to leave Forks, but she refuses to leave her dad.➽ Chapter 19:Bella tells Charlie that she is leaving to go back to Phoenix, but it is just a lie for the Cullens to protect her.➽ Chapter 20:Bella finally asking the real questions to Alice and Jesper about how to become a vampire, while Alice is having ballet studio premonitions.➽ Chapter 21:Bella pretends to be on the phone with her mom, but it’s really a blackmail phone call to lure her away from the Cullens once and for all.➽ Chapter 22:And Bella is extra dumb, so she runs away from the airport and goes to the ballet studio from her youth, where bad things happen to her.➽ Chapter 23:But no worries because Edward is able to suck the venom out and save her life.➽ Chapter 24:This is the chapter that irritated me the most (which is saying a lot), because I just truly hate Bella’s mom. She truly wants to split her time between her new man and her child, and it just feels horrible. Like, no wonder the Cullens seem so great, holy moly.➽ Epilogue:What better way to end this story than with Edward taking Bella to prom as a special surprise treat! Jacob proceeds to tell them that him and his family will be watching them. Meanwhile, Bella just wants to be a vampire, which is valid. I kinda loved how this book ends on a cliffhanger a tiny bit, where you might think that Edward is biting her, but we all know better than that.Overall, this was a full adventure with a full range of emotions. It has been well over a decade since I’ve read this, and I had forgotten so much. I will say that it did not entice me enough to pick up the next book again, but I am still curious about what Stephenie is finally (and actually) going to have published with Midnight Sun in August. And I’m more curious if she has revised it enough to have it meet 2020’s standards. (The bar is still so very low, but I like to think it isn't still 2005 low.)If you made it to the end of this, you are a brave soul, and I hope you find your special, sparkly vampire life partner(s).

27,12478933,01/14/2008,1.0,"there are so many problems with this book that i can't even begin to address them all. but i will say this, 'twilight' is probably one of the worst, if not THE worst, books i've ever read. the writing is amateurish at best [cliches, stereotypes, purple prose--how anyone can applaud meyer's prose is puzzling]; the editing--or lack thereof--is appalling [this is a 200 page novel, no more and probably less]; the grammar and syntax are unforgivably bad; the plot is onion-skin thin; and the characters are uniformly dull and uninspiring. it's hard to imagine how so many people got suckered into this book. the novel's protagonist, bella swan [really? i mean, really?], is a complete idiot. she has no dreams, no motivations, no ambitions, no hopes, no goals, and not a single original thought of her own. she spends 500 pages spewing endless platitudes and commenting on edwards 'perfect face,' 'amber eyes,' and 'perfectly-muscled chest' ad nauseum [those references number in the HUNDREDS, literally]. she constantly wonders why edward, a 100-year old domineering vampire, wants her. apparently she's the only one who doesn't realize how 'beautiful' she is. too bad, so sad. honestly, this is the kind of novel you'd expect see selling for $1.99 at the supermarket checkout, not winning all sorts of awards. at one point i was half-expecting to close the book and find fabio on the cover. and a glittery vampire? gimme a break. frankly, i'm mystified at its popularity. if nothing else, i guess it goes to show what clever marketing and stories of wish-fulfillment and so-called 'forbidden love' can do to some women. it's made meyer a multi-millionaire, i'm sure, and turned her publisher into a cash cow. i don't begrudge anyone his or her success, but when it comes via a turd like 'twilight,' it's well, more than a tad saddening. 'twlight' apologists will say that 'at least young women are reading!'i guess you could make that argument, but with that kind of logic you might as well congratulate an anorexic for eating a marshmallow.",285,-0.8687,0.19,0.644,0.165,0.6146589191232048,NEGATIVE,1.0

But I disagree. bcz at tht time, we kinda mold our behavior. reading abt someone like Bella can influence them and they might think tht being in a toxic relationship like her is the right way.It also talks abt how being 'not like the other girls' is good.

30,474013652,12/09/2012,3.0,"#1 Twilight ★★★☆☆ #2 New Moon - pending reread#3 Eclipse - pending reread#4 Breaking Dawn - pending reread Oh, boy. I know this is probably not a review that most of you expected to see pop up on my blog, and honestly, I almost didn’t even review this, because there are a million and one reviews in the world for each book in this series, and this was at least my eighth or ninth time rereading this… however(!), it was my first time reading it in 
ten years
 and I had a lot of unexpected feelings about it, so here we are.
 “And so the lion fell in love with the lamb…,” he murmured.“What a stupid lamb,” I sighed.“What a sick, masochistic lion.”
Okay, first of all, you guys, I gotta be honest—this book is still just as cringe-y as I remembered it being. The insta-love is so real, Bella has major not-like-other-girls syndrome, and some of Edward’s behaviors are downright terrifying. All of this is on top of how incredibly awkward most of the Cullens are, how ridiculously stereotypical some of the Native rep is, and the fact that the writing is just not up to par with what I’m used to reading these days.
 “I decided as long as I’m going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.”
All of that aside… I had a freaking blast rereading this. I laughed my ass off at so many points, I “aww”ed over little cinnamon roll Jacob all over again (#TeamJacob for life, y’all), I rolled my eyes at 80% of Edward’s dialogue, and I grew seriously concerned for the level of “clumsiness” Bella withholds. I mean, if your claims to have fallen down TWO flights of stairs and through a window just sounds like an average Friday night to your family, well… 
 “What if I’m not a superhero? What if I’m the bad guy?”
This is where my struggle to rate this comes in, though: if I were reading this for the first time, right now, it’d probably be a 2-star read. It’s fun enough to be worth more than 1, but problematic and ridiculous enough not to warrant 3, either. As an OG Twihard rereading these just for the fun of it, at a point in my life where I no longer let people give me hell for the things I like? This was so much fun and I legitimately can’t wait to continue rereading the series. So… we’ll say a 2.5-star rating, rounded up, eh?
 “Do I dazzle you?”
So, if you’re wondering if I recommend this title… it depends. If it’s going to be your first time reading the series, eh, you could probably live without it. If you were an oldschool fan, though? Go into this with a grain of salt the size of a Buick and understand that no, it’s not going to hold up to today’s YA literature, but yes, I think you’ll be happy you did it.",244,0.6131,0.087,0.828,0.084,0.5497831398399579,NEGATIVE,0.9993

They were sitting in the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible on the long room. There were five of them. They weren’t talking, and they weren’t eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in from of them. They weren’t gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of those things that caught, and held, my attention.







""That’s Edward. He’s gorgeous, of course, but don’t waste your time. He doesn’t date.""


I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by the antagonistic stare he’d given me.

""My name is Edward Cullen,"" he continued. ""I didn’t have a chance to introduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan.""










""Can’t you just Thank me and get over it?""""Thank you."" I waited, fuming and expectant. ""You’re not going to let this go, are you?""""No""In that case... I hope you enjoy disappointment.


""I’m Jacob Black."" He held out his hand in a friendly gesture. ""You bought my dad’s truck.""
I’m still loving the movie better. I like the way Jacob and Bella met better in the movie so far. And in the book they have Edward snickering from time to time. Just no! 🤣😂 smoldering not snickering.

32,71964850,09/21/2009,4.0,"Twilight (Twilight #1), Stephenie MeyerTwilight is a series of four vampire-themed fantasy romance novels by American author Stephenie Meyer. Released annually from 2005 through 2008, the four books chart the later teen years of Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, a girl who moves to Forks, Washington, and falls in love with a 104-year-old vampire named Edward Cullen. The series is told primarily from Bella's point of view, with the epilogue of Eclipse and Part II of ""Breaking Dawn"" being told from the viewpoint of character Jacob Black, a werewolf. Bella Swan is a seventeen-year-old introvert girl who moved from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula to live with her father, Charlie Swan, the town's police chief. Her mother, Renée Dwyer, is traveling with her new husband, Phil Dwyer, a minor league baseball player. Bella is admitted to Forks High School, where she easily settles in with a group of friends. A somewhat inexperienced and shy girl, Bella is dismayed by several boys competing for her attention.On the first day of her school, Bella sits next to Edward in biology class, but he seems to be utterly repulsed by her, much to her bewilderment. He disappears for a few days but when he returns, he is unexpectedly friendly to Bella. Their newfound relationship is interrupted after Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward saves Bella, narrowly stopping the van with his bare hands. Bella questions Edward about how he saved her life but he refuses to tell anything.During a cam-pout, she meets Jacob Black, a local boy from the Quileute tribe. She learns from him that Edward and his family are actually vampires who consume only animal blood. Disturbed and riddled by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «شفق»، «اسطوره شفق»، «گرگ و میش»؛ نویسنده: استفنی مه یر؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: در یکی از روزهای سال 2009میلادیعنوان: شفق - کتاب نخست از سری گرگ و میش؛ نویسنده: استفنی مه یر؛ مترجم: ایرج مثال آذر؛ کرج، در دانش بهمن، 1386، در 526ص؛ شابک9789641740575؛ چاپ مکرر 1387، چاپ سوم 1388، چاپ پنجم تا هشتم 1389، موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: اسطوره شفق؛ نویسنده: استفنی مه یر؛ مترجم: گلنار مقدم؛ تهران، نشر گستر، 1389، در 374ص؛ شابک 9786005883039؛ عنوان: گرگ و میش؛ نویسنده: استفنی مه یر؛ مترجم: الهام دژکام؛ تهران، چکاوک، 1393، در 527ص؛ شابک 9789648957181؛ استفنی مه یر، دانش آموخته ی دانشگاه «بریگهام یانگ» در «ایالت یوتا»، در رشته ی ادبیات «انگلیسی» نام آشنا هستند، ایشان در «آریزونای آمریکا» زندگی میکنند، «شفق» یا «گرگ و میش»، از کتابهای پرفروش جهان است، در داستانهای طنز فارسی، داستانی داریم، حکایت شیری که عاشق آهو شد، شیر نری دلباخته‏ ی آهویی ماده شد؛ شیر نگران معشوق خویش بود، و می‏ترسید معشوقش، توسط حيوانات ديگر دريده شود، از دور مواظبش بود، چشم از آهو برنمیداشت، تا اینکه یکبار، که از دور او را مینگریست، شیری را دید، که به آهو حمله کرد؛ و ...؛ انگار میکنم شاید همین داستان، الگوی بانو «استفنی مه یر»، برای نگارگری این کتاب بوده باشد، داستان زندگی نوجوانی به نام (ایزابلا «بلا» سوان) را بازگویی میکند؛ «بلا»، دختری است، که به شهر «فورکس» در ایالت «واشنگتن»، نقل مکان کرده، و در آنجا، عاشق خون آشامی به ظاهر جوان، اما در واقع یکصد و چهارده ساله، به نام «ادوارد کالن» میشود؛ داستانها از دیدگاه «بلا» بازگویی میشوند، گرچه بخشهای اندکی از داستان را، گرگینه ای با نام «جیکوب بلک» پیش میبردتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 08/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 24/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",237,-0.6004,0.037,0.932,0.031,0.3602918069584735,POSITIVE,0.9697
33,38510522,11/24/2008,2.0,"I got so tired of receiving Twilight questions on the Never-Ending Quiz that I went out and bought a copy. It's about as good as I had expected, but I have already managed to answer a few questions correctly.An anecdote which I at least found amusing. Shortly after buying it, I was invited to an eighteenth birthday party (our next door neighbor's daughter). I had the following conversation with Cate:""So I suppose you read the Twilight books?""""No, what are they?""""You know, those vampire books. I just bought the first one.""""Oh... right. Can I borrow it when you're finished?""She wasn't just teasing me... when I left, she checked to make sure I remembered. So somehow I've ended up supplying Stephenie Meyer to 18 year old girls. How did that happen?****************OK, now I've finished it. I still don't understand why this is apparently the greatest publishing phenomenon of the post-Potter world. Here are a few hypotheses:Sex. Don't underestimate sex, everyone knows it sells books. And there are some pretty steamy, graphic descriptions of kissing and snuggling, which could conceivably get a suggestible pre-teen all hot and bothered. I'm not a suggestible pre-teen, so it's a little difficult to judge.Style. Often more important than people realise. It's a first-person narrative, and yes, it does read as though it had been written by a shy, bookish, 17 year old girl, whose main literary output to date had been essays about Macbeth and Jane Eyre for her English class. You can positively hear her congratulating herself every time she uses a polysyllabic word. (Well done, Manny, ""polysyllabic"" is bound to net me an extra point!) So I guess this says something about the author's skill, or helps teen readers identify with the heroine?Paedophilia. You're constantly reading about all those creepy paedophiles who lurk in chatrooms, pretending to be teenagers and trying to groom unsuspecting victims. This is, formally, a romance between a 17-year old female virgin and a centenarian. You can see how useful it would be. ""I just love Twilight! It doesn't bother me at all that he's so much older than her! I think he loves her just as much as she loves him!"" Excuse me while I throw up, I got too far into character there for a moment.Unfortunately, none of these explanations really convince me. I must find someone to ask! Well, having now finished the book, I'm going to lend it to Cate across the road - in fact, she and her parents are coming to dinner this evening. But I think Cate will be as mystified as I am. How about my goddaughter Sophie, who's only 12? My first thought is that she'll find it too unsophisticated, but perhaps I'm overestimating her. Stay tuned for further updates.****************Those further updates I promised. It's only a sample of two, and I would love more data, but so far I am not convinced that all young womanhood in the Western world is infected with the deadly Meyer mind-virus.As I said, I lent the book to Cate-across-the-road (just turned 18, cute, party animal). I was indeed a little apprehensive when she asked to borrow my copy. But when I saw her today and asked for an opinion, it rapidly become clear that she hadn't even looked at it - she has better things to do than read this trash. She was relieved when I made it clear that I was the opposite of offended.I also polled my goddaughter Sophie (almost 13, smart, voracious reader, into chess and any kind of sport). When I dropped by for our usual Sunday morning chess session, I asked her if she had read Twilight. There was a brief moment of mildly embarrassed silence, which I interpreted as: why is he asking me such a dumb question, that's not like him? Then she shrugged and said no, she hadn't, and we went back to looking at the Slav Defense.It would be reassuring to hear more stories like these, though...****************http://www.goodreads.com/trivia/detai...I couldn't resist the temptation to post this question on the Quiz. So far no one has flamed me, but it's early days yet. Come on, Twilight fans, you afraid of a fight?****************I hardly got flamed at all. Damn! Sorry, Twilight fans, you are as insipid as your heroine. ****************Another update. Oh dear. Cate finally gave back the copy that she'd borrowed several months ago. I'm afraid to say that she's not merely read it, she loved it. Now she's going to read the whole series. What have I done?Not only that, Sophie saw the movie and thought it was ""great"".

Shouldn't I take some time to actually *review* this book? But dear friends, is there really a need for yet ANOTHER Twilight review? Because if you somehow still have no idea about this book series, I would love to borrow your tinfoil hat. I'm serious. Besides, nothing in the universe can ever compete with this very thoughtful review by Bird Brian.Anyway, how about the story of my relationship with Twilight, this Twinkie¹ of literature? ¹ Twinkie, because it's addictive to many and yet lacks any kind of substance/nutritional value besides empty calories. You watch, when the world is destroyed in nuclear explosion, cockroaches and Twinkies will be what's left on this planet. Also, I think I may have borrowed this comparison from the one and only Cleolinda Jones.Once upon a time, 5-6 years ago, I was sick with the nastiest flu and therefore was lying in bed browsing the Interwebs in the state of cough-syrup-induced befuzzlement, when somehow, via a combination of inexplicable links I came across the site that popped my Twilight cherry with the best parodies that I have yet come across:Enter 
Cleolinda Jones
, whose incredulous snark of Twilight recaps made me the happiest person on this planet for a while:Introducing the immortal recaps of Stephenie Meyer's wish-fulfillment creations, featuring 'fursploding', 'sparklepires', and this brilliant wrap-up of the series:""And they sexed happily ever after in their magic cottage while their half-vampire toddler slept in the next room, and it was the best series starting with a teenage girl in love with a mysterious boy in her class that ended up with a teenage girl defending her growth-accelerated mutant hybrid baby from an ancient clan of evil vampires with her magical psychic shield that I ever read, THE END.""
Cleolinda did not stop here, however. She did watch all four Twilight movies and - bless her selfless heart - treated us to her trademark

 parodies of them, which, dear reader, you can find here:
Twilight in Fifteen MinutesNew Moon in Fifteen MinutesEclipse in Fifteen MinutesAnd, finally, Breaking Dawn in Fifteen Minutes (Part One)
-------------Meanwhile, there was Dana who was appalled by the lack of respect for basic grammar (not to mention decent storytelling) that Twilight books showed. And therefore she created... wait for it... wait for it...The best Tumblr ever - Reasoning with Vampires
I owe so much of my grammar refreshers to Dana's keen eye and never-ending patience. And, just for a taste of it, I hope I'm allowed to share my all-time favorite from this Tumblr (which I will take down immediately if there is any problem):--------------------While Dana was hard at work correcting the grammar and awful writing of Twilight, the guys over at Rifftrax.com (formerly of MST-3000 fame) were busy creating the parody mp3 tracks, that when played over the Twilight movies finally achieve the goal of turning those into hilarious, although not always PG-13, films.Among other creations of pure comedic genius, they brought us their version of the infamous Edward's lullaby, which you can see here on YouTube, complete with the following immortal lyrics:""I want to chomp into your throoooooat.And watch you bleed out on the floooooor.Then I'll bathe myself in your life essenceas you die.Tear your heart out of your chest and crack the bones and suck the marrow out.

You know those books that are just so horrible that you want to go on and on about how horrible they were, but you don't want to waste your precious time doing it? I'm in that situation. To review, or not to review? Hmm.Oh, damn it. Fine! Well, it has been quite a long time since I read this book, but the dreadful memory of it plagues my mind. The writing is bad. Like really, really bad. The first few sentences of this book are about the weather and Bella's favorite shirt. That's shit writing for me. Then she'd talk about how fruity Edward's chest smelled. Fruity? That's attractive.Sometimes there were pages of just description. Describing the most irrelevant things that caused me to skip most of the pages.And the adjectives! Meyer just needs an adjective for every single noun she has in her book. ""Now, more than ever, I yearned for his carefree laugh and his infectious grin. I needed the safe sanity of his homemade garage and his warm hand around my cold fingers."" Meyer also believes that using long, seemingly complicated words in her sentences makes her writing more ""sophisticated."" She doesn't even use them in the right context! The more a writer tends to use long, unnecessary words, the more of a truly lousy writer they are. Bella is a bore.Edward is creepy. He watches Bella sleep at night, claiming that it's fascinating. In all his 100 something years living, he hasn't seen a human sleep? Watching a girl sleep at night is the most interesting thing he's ever done in his life? He could be doing so many things with his long vampire life. Traveling, making friends, finding the cure to cancer. But no matter how much I hate Twilight, I can't hate it more than the man who plays Edward himself, Robert Pattinson. I have yet to see someone who hates it more than he does. Poor dude. “My wife is dying, I have completely f-cked up my life and hers, and Jacob’s like [To Bella] ‘Hey, baby, you don’t look too bad to me.' And I’m just sitting there, like, with a bucket collecting [Bella’s] vomit. That really wouldn’t happen. I should have thrown the vomit at him.”Dude's hilarious. Also, what kind of vampire sparkles in the sunlight????? That I don't get. And why is he on a bunny diet?????Plot: ""And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever.""It's really not.

After seeing mixed reviews on it and reading that many people complained about the writing and characters,  I bypassed it for awhile, but I had to read it. I'm a long time Anne Rice fan and LOVE vampire stories.I fell in love with this book from the first chapter...""In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I’d been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.""Bella is moving to Forks, Washington, to live with her dad. Forks is a small town and dreary for the most part. Bella doesn't have a great relationship with her dad as she was raised by her mom, plus she's sort of the new girl in town and doesn't really know anyone. Bella's new life is fairly boring until the Cullen family comes into the picture. ""I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful – maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy.""

Bella is fascinated by the Cullens and ends up with an assigned seat next to Edward in Biology class. Edward acts strangely...""I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away from him, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenly ran through my mind.""

It's so mysterious. Why is Edward acting so strangely around her? Bella is fascinated by him and as the story moves forward, there's no telling the upcoming circumstances Bella will be dealing with.This may not be the beautiful prose that many people are looking for, but the plot and characters were enough to captivate me. I loved everything about it and flew through it. I couldn't wait to read the next book.My rating on this book is 5*****",189,0.9751,0.074,0.816,0.11,0.4964040404040403,POSITIVE,0.9871

41,3723140998,12/28/2020,2.0,"This book has all the elements of a one-star rating. Terrible main character, disgusting love interest, no plot, lack of diversity, a ~lOvE tRiAnGlE~, and unenjoyable writing. The reason I bumped it up a star? I actually enjoyed it.In sixth grade.I haven’t read this book in years.But yes. 12-year-old me did somehow enjoy this series. Don’t ask me how or why because I have no idea. Yet this book became one that I read and reread. I’m not one of those people who still has a nostalgic spot for this series because it introduced me to YA. But I did like this book three years ago, so there’s that.*long sigh*Let’s play a game. Name one YA protagonist who has no reason to exist other than her Beautiful Special Love Interest™ (bonus points if he has special eyes) and calls herself Plain And Ordinary™ even though there’s a Love Triangle™ because Boys Can’t Stay Away From Her™. She is the Chosen One™ who can Save The World™ because she has her Magical Boyfriend™ with her.If you guessed Bella Swan, you are very much correct.As I’m sure most people will agree, Bella Swan is one of the most useless YA protagonists of all time. She’s better than Kelsey Hayes, but marginally worse than Clary Fray. Bella is the quintessential Good Girl™ who reads Shakespeare and Wuthering Heights, aces biology, and cooks dinner for her dad because he’s a grown man who relies on his daughter to survive I guess.Bella is...stupid. Being good at school is not a personality trait and neither is reading classics. I say that as someone who can do both if she would stop wasting so much time on procrastinating and writing this damn review. Bella doesn’t have a personality other than obsessing unhealthily over a boy who supposedly hates her, and maybe cooking dinner if she’s not over at Edward’s house or lost in the forest or something.Also, the way she described herself in the beginning was just…Like I said earlier, Bella is supposed to be Plain and Ordinary™ because she has brown hair and pale skin and isn’t athletic. Wow. And wow, she’s such a special snowflake for not fitting in with people at school and for not playing sports. What a predicament for our Good Girl Heroine™.To sum up my reaction to Bella:Looking back on this book, the plot makes literally no sense whatsoever. So first, Bella is so ~self-sacrificial~ that she’s moving to Washington so that her mom can be happy? I mean, that kind of makes sense since my mom would be very happy if I moved across the country, but it’s literally such a big deal that Bella is so ~loving~ that she would go move in with her dad.And then she meets Edward, a pale hot guy who intimidates her and doesn’t talk to anyone other than his siblings, and she automatically falls in love. Why? Maybe because he literally exudes hostility and literally freaks her out so much that she considers skipping school. Such a romantic trait.And of course Edward is a vampire because...um...he’s pale? And he doesn’t eat food? And he’s attractive?That makes so much sense. Naturally Edward is a vampire, because his beautiful attractive special eyes change color sometimes and he’s really pale. There’s no possibility that he’s just a pretty white boy who doesn’t like cafeteria food, right? That would be insane.Almost as insane as suddenly believing in vampires when supposedly your world is completely ordinary.And it makes so much sense that as an immortal, you would choose to retake high school over and over again in different parts of the United States. What if a bunch of high schools just realized that they had had the Cullens logged into their systems like fifty times in total?The Cullen teenage vampires could have been doing jobs (since apparently they looked like adults/college kids anyway) or learning more stuff. Like, if Edward had centuries to learn piano or something, couldn’t he have studied genetics and used his magical vampire eyes to look at DNA or something? Imagine the scientific breakthroughs a magical immortal could make within a century. Or the books they could write under different pen names.But no. They chose to keep doing high school over again.The romance in this book is one of the classic examples of YA failure, and for very good reason. Edward was terrifyingly creepy, and I’m sorry to all the fangirls and idiotic female protagonists out there...but being attractive does not make up for being a stalker.*offended gasps from the crowd*The first thing I thought of when I thought of Edward was “GOLDEN EYES LIKE TOPAZ” because that’s one of the only thoughts Bella ever has. The second thing that came to mind was “HE’S SPARKLY” because that’s the other thought that Bella has. And the third thing that came to mind was “I like to watch you sleep.”None of those things are healthy, but especially not the last one (although if your skin is sparkly I’m a little concerned). Who the fuck follows a girl home and goes into her room to watch her sleep? Why? I don’t care how “fascinating” she is to you, you DON’T FOLLOW HER HOME AND BREAK INTO HER FUCKING HOUSE TO WATCH HER LIE UNCONSCIOUS.Seriously, Edward’s tendency to stalk Bella was disturbing. He literally drove after her to another city when she was shopping with her friends. And he said he did it because he was “worried about her”. Um if you were worried maybe you should have asked if you could come? Or, you know, gotten her number so she could text you if she was unsafe? Like a normal person would? But no, instead he decided to STALK HER around the city of Seattle.And the sad thing is, I actually found this romantic as a sixth grader. “Oh that’s so sweet, he was worried about her.” I literally romanticized the fact that Edward stalked Bella because he thought she was that stupid.What makes me worried about her now is that she attracts creepy guys.Literally.That one guy that she almost ran over (I forget his name) literally SHOWED UP AT HER HOUSE even though she already told him she didn’t want to go to prom with him? Um? She said NO you fucking idiot.Luckily, this guy pissed me off because of how clueless and annoying he was, so I didn’t romanticize him.And then Jacob. I think he was okay in the first book, but after his friendship with Bella was ruined and he became the ~angsty teenage man-child~ I just could not deal with this misogynistic hotheaded idiot. Also, the way Bella baited him was fucking toxic.She literally flirted with him to make him TELL HER A STORY? Bitch why don’t you go read, I thought you were supposed to be smart or something. She decided to try to make him fall in love with her so that he could tell her what was basically a fairy tale...because she was obsessed with Edward.And then she acted surprised when he fell for her even though obviously, after her arrival in Forks, about twelve guys just naturally fell for her lack of personality and her...clumsiness?If that’s all it takes for a shit ton of idiots to fall head-over-heels in love with you, I would have so many people mooning over me. Maybe they would even climb through my bedroom window.Listen. If someone follows you home and admits to watching you everywhere you go, you call the police.That’s what Bella should have done. She should have called the police. Or, you know, listened to the police (aka her dad) when he told her to stay away from Edward. But she didn’t because of Edward’s beautiful, smoldering, captivating golden eyes. How could you ever say no to those burning pieces of topaz? This book internalizes misogyny, manipulation and abuse as normal and loving.The only part I still like when I think about this book is the Cullens. Alice was one of my favorite book characters in sixth grade, and while she’s nowhere near there now I still like her. She was actually pretty decent. Jasper was okay, and I liked him in Eclipse. Rosalie was a bitch but she had a good backstory and more personality than Bella (I was going to say ten times more personality, but 10 x 0 = 0). Carlisle was nice, and Esme was sweet. Emmett was kind of just there.Basically, this book is terrible and makes no sense at all in hindsight. Is it still enjoyable? Sure, I guess. Is it fun to read? Yeah, for me. Is it entertaining? In a bad way.Is it problematic and trashy? Yes. Does it give terrible ideas of romance? Yes. Does it have awful main characters and a very, very bad plot? Yes.But you can’t deny that this book series is extremely popular and has a reason to be. Even if one of its claims to fame is that it’s hated by millions of reviewers.",172,0.9981,0.109,0.734,0.157,0.6060382301068576,NEGATIVE,1.0

43,20134609,04/14/2008,5.0,"Reviewed for THC ReviewsI have to admit that I haven't read much young adult literature during my adult life, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Twilight. There was also a great deal of hype surrounding this book, which can sometimes mean a really great book and other times can be a big letdown. Now that I have finally read Twilight, I have to say that it definitely lived up to the hype for me. I absolutely loved this tale of teen love between a human and a vampire. With this type of subject matter the story could have been completely campy, but instead was very beautiful, in my opinion, with enough romance and substance to rival the best adult romance novels. In fact, I thought that Twilight exhibited a surprising depth of emotion, intimacy and even sensuality without ever resorting to anything explicit. I think the intimacy was owing in large part to the amazing level of communication between Bella and Edward. These two teen protagonists affected more stark honesty in their communication than many adult characters in romance novels, rarely holding anything back from each other. Edward was even forthcoming about who and what he was far sooner than I ever expected him to be. The sensuality was conveyed through simple things like smiles, kisses and touches and most importantly their beautiful dialog. Of course much of this was possible because neither Edward nor Bella were really “normal” teenagers. I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed the book nearly as much as I did if the main teen characters had behaved in what has seemed to become the “typical” teen manner of extreme cattiness, rebellion, and out-of-control hormones. Instead, the story became a refreshing take on teen behavior, and a gentle reminder that not all teens do behave in the “typical” way.I honestly can't think of a single thing that's not to like about the two main characters, Edward and Bella. Edward is a kind, sensitive and loving beta hero with a dash of alpha protectiveness (he probably wouldn't be a very good vampire without that). He wages a constant battle in his own mind between the knowledge that Bella is perfect for him and the knowledge that being near him will only increase the risks for his adorable but accident-prone danger-magnet. Edward is frequently reminding Bella of the risk he himself poses to her very life, and yet he always behaves as a perfect gentleman, even in the most difficult circumstances. I also love the gentle way that Edward teases Bella, and sometimes she gives back in kind. I enjoyed this banter and thought that it gave a lightly humorous dimension to the story. In addition to having a good sense of humor, Bella was also very intelligent, shy and a bit socially awkward, and endearingly clumsy, making her entirely relatable to me. Bella considered herself to be a very plain, ordinary girl, but Edward thought her to be completely beautiful. Having played the role of parent in her relationship with both of her parents, one could say that Bella had not had the most ideal upbringing, but it did not stop her from being the best person she could be or loving her parents dearly. I think Bella's best trait, though, was her intuitive nature about Edward and things in general. I love it when the heroine in a romance novel can simply sense things about the hero and read into that accordingly. Bella did have one moment where I would predict that many adult readers would consider her TSTL (too-stupid-to-live), but I was able to forgive that lapse because of her youth and inexperience with such dangerous situations. Overall, both Edward and Bella were two engaging characters who sparkled (no pun intended, but you'll get it when you read the book) in nearly every scene that they shared. I greatly enjoyed reading them and thought that they complimented each other perfectly.The secondary cast of characters was a wonderful dichotomous mix of both the human and the supernatural. There were Bella's high school friends, who were generally a mix of pretty good kids, the type I wouldn't mind my own kids being friends with or would have liked being friends with myself in my teen years. Edward's family was an eclectic mix of personalities. There was Emmet, the big, lovable lug of a teddy bear, mysterious and aloof Rosalie, Alice and Jasper with their amazing psychic and empathic gifts, and their “parents,” Carlisle (aka Dr. Cullen) and Esme, who all have their own fascinating back-stories. I also found the Native American father and son characters, Billy and Jacob Black to be intriguing. They seem to share some contentious history with the Cullens which isn't fully explored in this volume. It will be very interesting to see where this part of the story leads in future installments.Twilight is a very sweet and innocent romance, which I mentioned earlier has no explicit elements. There is no sex, only a couple of mild profanities, and considering that the subject matter deals with vampires, the violence is kept to a minimum. In my opinion, this book is quite appropriate for the age group for which it is intended. I would have no problem at all with my children reading it when they are a bit older. In fact, I felt as I read the book that it sends some positive family and relationship messages to teens. Even though Bella's relationship with her parents is less than ideal, there is still love and respect between them, and Edward seems to have very loving “family” connections as well. What I liked most, though, is the development of Edward and Bella's romance. Their physiological attraction to each other is immediate and powerful, yet they take the time to build a friendship that is based on mutual trust, respect, and love, which is more than can be said for many adults. Edward and Bella only discuss sex one time over the course of the novel and in very subtle terms, but in my opinion, Edward's blood lust could be taken as something of a metaphor for sexual desire. Whether taken in the metaphorical or mythological context, I thought that Edward's self-control contained a beautiful message of his pure love for Bella superseding all other desires.I found Twilight to be a thoroughly enjoyable read which has earned a place on my keeper shelf. The first two-thirds of the book moves at a rather languid but steady pace owing to the extensive character and relationship development. After that, it almost instantly turns into a taut suspense/thriller when Bella's life is threatened. This is one of those books that was very difficult to put down. I just couldn't wait to see what might happen next or what new piece of the puzzle might be revealed, and Ms. Meyer also did not disappoint with her own unique take on vampire mythology. Even though the book is written entirely in first-person from Bella's perspective, I thought the author did a good job of conveying Edward's thoughts and feelings too, through extensive use of dialog. As an aside, I really liked the small-town atmosphere of Forks, but as a Phoenician, I couldn't help but have a soft spot for the scenes in Phoenix. As such, I can attest to all the place names being real and the descriptions of the city to be spot on, which isn't surprising since Ms. Meyer is a Phoenician as well. It was rather surreal but also pretty cool to read scenes that are set in places that I have actually been. Twilight is the first volume in the Twilight Saga followed by 
New Moon
, Eclipse, and 
Breaking Dawn

45,3305741887,04/27/2020,4.0,"I’m doing it. I’m reading Twilight for the first time. I’m taking extensive notes as I go along to take you on this journey with me. (Scroll down to keep up with me as I update)• Update #1 my narrative thoughts so far:- I gave this book a shot because I’m extremely bored and being stared at by Edward Cullen seems like a great alternative distraction.- I never thought I’d relate to Bella Swan, but then I opened the first chapter and boom, we’re in such a similar bleak headspace right now.“That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory.”- I feel like Tom in Parks and Rec actually being impressed by the Twilight series.


- That first chapter actually helped me quiet the thunderous thoughts in my head before I went to sleep. It’s like her inner monologue reassured me. Nothing is as scary as it seems in your head. Well, at least, some things.• Update #2 give this a read to reminisce on twilight scenes through fresh eyes: - The iconic biology class scene, which is arguably one of the funniest scenes in the movie. . . . how did this innocent direction: “Just as I passed, he suddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyes with the strangest expression on his face — it was hostile, furious.” lead to this:“He was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his face like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor.”I'm laughing out loud at that last line.- Edward pretending he doesn’t already know everything about Bella when they’ve just met. . . . Bella *yells into microphone* he’s eavesdropping on your conversations from across the room.• Update #3 emotions take over rationale “I couldn’t believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me — just because he’d happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I couldn’t allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was unhealthy.”I was taken back by Bella being self-aware of this. I feel like the main critique surrounding Twilight is just how little Bella seems aware of Edward's hot-and-cold behavior.- The constant staring for these past 20 pages is getting to me. I don’t think even céline from before sunrise (1995) would like this.- “Wow, you’re green, Bella,” Mike said nervously.”It's that Twilight movie coloring. Also, do I have to pretend to care about her school friends? I'm just here to get a serving of Twilight angst.- Trying not to mix up the vampire rules within The Vampire Diaries and Twilight. like, do they both have the rule that you have to be invited into a house to enter it? and can they both hypnotize people? or are those rules in only of them?- “Do you think that I could be scary?” He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face.Why does his question to Bella remind me of the big bad scary wolf and little red riding hood?• Update #4 Jacob or Edward?- Now that Jacob is present in the book, I feel like the next stage is around the age-old debate on who’s better for Bella. Naturally, I need to confront the pros and cons list:con: Jacob is 15.con: Edward is super controlling.yeah, seeing it written out, those are two different levels of negatives. pro: Jacob is sweet and caring and a childhood friend.pro: edward is super hot (?)It’s like rationally you know who she should choose. But just like Bella, there’s only one you look forward to showing up. It’s clear she sees Jacob as a little kid in this book. The verdict is still out on my final choice. the head says jacob, the heart... to be continued.- “I was sitting in my room, researching vampires. What was wrong with me?”I am sitting in my room, reading about vampires. Is there something wrong with me?- I just looked up from the book only to realize it's dark out. I've been reading twilight all day. Wow. It's been forever since i've felt so immersed in a bookDay Two:• Update #5- I kind of get Bella's infatuation with Edward at this point in the story. She practically lives alone with Charlie always being gone or at work. She also lives in a tiny town where she knows nobody. She has no friends. Of course she's going to hold on to the one thing that distracts her from her own miserable thoughts. I’m just dismayed that he’s a controlling prick at that.- “I’d read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to remember after I began chapter three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren’t there any other names available in the late eighteenth century?”Ha! Having them occupy your head even when you’re trying to be distracted. . . I had to laugh at that. “It was the same as yesterday — I just couldn’t keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table.”Why is this so relatable? Are all crushes the same?- “Get in,” a furious voice commanded.It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing how suddenly the feeling of security washed over me — even before I was off the street — as soon as I heard his voice.”I’m amazed at the convenience of Edward always being there to save Bella. But her judgment is clouded when he's around her. I get that she wants someone to care for her, cinderella complex and all. But don’t let that be a distraction from the fact that he treats her like a soldier under his command. He’s not your commander.- If you look solely at Edward's actions so far, he seems nice and respecting: saving her from trouble, opening the door for her, shrugging off his jacket when he notices she’s cold. but his reprimanding tone of voice, chastising bella like she’s a toddler is so off-putting.Someone who takes initiative in a respectful manner: attractive.Someone who orders you around claiming it’s ""for your own good"": off-putting- I like that edward always asks bella “what are you thinking” because he can’t read her thoughts like he does with other people. he has to communicate with her- “About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was part of him — and I didn’t know how potent that part might be — that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.”When you put it like that . . .day three of reading twilight:>- Why are Bella and I both so desperate for connection that someone showing up on a cold morning in a heated car with a jacket on the passenger seat just drives me nuts. I guess it’s the fact that for once edward didn't accompany it by some snide remark on her incompetence to care for herself. It's moments like these that you're like, oh yeah, that’s why edward's her first choice. Like I said, edward was most intriguing when he was staring at her from across the room with his mouth shut. Let’s keep it that way. - Why is the author suddenly making edward likable with like his constant smiles and helping bella out without the taunting remarks? “The vampire who wanted to be good — who ran around saving people’s lives so he wouldn’t be a monster . . .”Those rose-colored glasses are in full effect, huh? You forget the fact of his rage in those moments and his vicious comments at your expense.- “I’m not surprised you heard something you didn’t like. You know what they say about eavesdroppers,” I reminded him.“I warned you I would be listening.”Why does Bella have to worry about her conversations with her friends being analysed? Let her have friends (even though I hate Jessica, but that’s for another conversation).- “I supposed I could purposefully put myself in danger to keep him close. . . . I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on my face. That idea would definitely get me in trouble.”It's not your words that ""get you in trouble."" It's his rage that he doesn't control. it's on him. not on you.- “Should I . . . ?” I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room.His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch.“No, it’s tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.”When edward has to stop kissing bella so he won’t devour her whole in one bite… #relatable - “And so the lion fell in love with the lamb...,” he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word.“What a stupid lamb,” I sighed.“What a sick, masochistic lion.”I can’t believe this is the most quoted piece in Twilight.- “How often did you come here?”“I come here almost every night.”I whirled, stunned. “Why?”“You’re interesting when you sleep.” He spoke matter-of-factly. “You talk.”He’s admitting this so casually. I-“Oh no!” I hung my head. He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally.“Don’t be self-conscious,” he whispered in my ear. “If I could dream at all, it would be about you.”We're in too deep at this point . . . .“The glory of first love, and all that. It’s incredible, isn’t it, the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?”All logic is gone at this point because he's behaving nicely.- Bella and Edward after being together for one whole day:“I love you,” I whispered.“You are my life now,” he answered simply.”- “Maybe it’s none of my business, but I don’t think that is such a good idea.”“You’re right,” I agreed. “It is none of your business.”Insolent teen angst. I was about to say respect your elders, but then I remembered Edward's age. . .- Naive: thinking this book would be just about Bella and Edward rubbing faces. I forgot books with plot points still exist. I feel robbed. I thought they were building up to something more later on… but I guess four books exist for a reason.- Me being infatuated with Twilight: realizing I'm rushing through the daily tasks that distract me from going back to reading. I wonder if I'm past the point of no return?- We want more Bella and Edward scenes - a sentence I never thought I’d utter when I first started reading. But damn it, they somehow got under my skin with all their tender scenes together.- “Can I cut in?” he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn’t have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I’d seen him.”my boy Jacob is all grown up.- “Twilight, again,” he murmured. “Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.” I can't believe it's over. I was just getting settled into the story when I reached the epilogue, secretly hoping it would be a long ending. My hope for the next book - as the whole Jacob vs Edward ordeal develops - is that the author doesn't settle for returning those tiring red flags so that it'll influence to stan one guy over the other. Make me love them both. Give me tender Edward getting breathless at Bella's proximity, or as close to breathless as vampires get. And give me sweet Jacob bringing Bella back from the brink of her frenzy over Edward. I want a good duel. May the most respectful man win.In conclusion, this Psychology student is well aware of the mess this romance presents, but boy, what a necessary distraction it is for this period of time.Thank you for keeping up with my extensive notes, especially those who kept up with my tweets as I was reading @bookspoils. Let me know if you want me to rewatch the Twilight movie first or continue straight onto book two!(I nearly ended Goodreads with this longwinded review)In case you're interested in tagging along, check out a refresher of the series here:

47,1770975788,09/29/2016,3.0,"help why did i love this so much. maybe i’ll write a few review? it’ll just be a roast honestly. Buddy Reading with one of my favourite people, MaggieI’m personally not ashamed to say it was Twilight that got me into reading. I will never slam it for that, because when I was ten I did love it. I remember borrowing it from the library and being absorbed by it quickly. My family jumped on it and for three years I only realised Twilight merch. I even had a shirt saying “Team Edward” and another saying “Team Jacob”, and I would wear them. Oh, how times were easier. However, despite the nostalgia that Twilight gave me I found myself struggling. I couldn’t handle. The dialogue. The scenes. The completely problematic undertones of everything, and the characters. I basically wrote an essay before this review of notes and quotes I wanted to use, but I only find myself infuriated by it all. If you’re looking for a character with no backbone and absolutely no sense of personality Bella is your girl. Bella, our main character, is a clumsy albino. Oh, you didn’t quite catch that? Don’t worry, it’s going to be mentioned at least 50 times in the first half of the book. Honestly. You think I’m kidding? Have this quote of Bella after she had seen the Cullen’s for the first time. 
“Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino.”
So, anyway, to begin Bella moves to Fork’s of her own free will. You wouldn’t know that from how childish she is acting about it. In the first chapter her mother even informs her that she doesn’t need to go, but Bella continues to inform everyone about how much she hates it and how much she has to do it. If only it ended there. It doesn’t. Bella is the definition of “not like other girls”. She is such a snob it is almost ridiculous and unbearable to read. We’re supposed to think Bella is the greatest thing since sliced bread (which is not possible because, ah, sliced bread?) because she has done all the assignments that her classes at Forks are teaching and she can’t do gym. How relatable! Not. As someone who tried to go up a down escalator and face planted hard, I am not even as clumsy as Bella was. It was absolutely disconnecting to read about her stumbling and stammering every other sentence. At the age I am now I prefer my female characters to be strong, able to stand up for themselves, Bella does none of that. Let’s not forget that because of Bella’s “quirky” – read bland – personality that three boys ask her to the Spring Prom. She rejects all three and has the audacity to them set them up with her friends, like they weren’t good enough for her but they’re good enough for her friends? Lovely. Then we have Edward, the epitome of a creep and controlling asshole. Why would I say that? Well, his personality is constantly changing. He gets cranky at Bella, only to smile and laugh it off. When Bella goes to drive herself home after she almost faints in Biology, he drags her to his car and tells her that if she tries to leave he will only drag her back. What does Bella do?Get in the car. In all my notes about Edward, I referred to him as creepy old man and I think that truly captures what he is like. A ninety (?) year old man trying to date a 17-year-old girl? Romance. It’s not even just that. Edward flat out tells Bella he is the villain and he’s dangerous, but the girl just bites her lip and is okay with it. Hello, girl, run. I mean, the fact she Googles “Vampire”. Doesn’t that say it all. It gets worse, trust me. When Bella confronts Edward about being able to read minds and being a vampire – mind you, before this, she was almost raped and probably murdered – she doesn’t care. She is fine. She just has questions. She doesn’t run screaming like a sane person, oh no. She stays in the damn car and lets Edward drive over 100 miles (I’m not sure how fast that is in km) an hour. Yeah, no. Oh, and one of my biggest problems? When Edward tells Bella he can’t read her mind she reacts like this:
”My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak?”
My own survival instincts told me to throw my phone at a wall and be done with it because, what?!What an absolute idiot are you? This creepy old man has told you that he has a temper and wanted to murder some people – to which you told him you feel safe with him – and you want to know if you’re a freak? Oh sorry, no, you want to know if a mind reading vampire thinks you’re a freak. Never mind, totally justifiable. 
 “That wasn't the first time,"" he said, and his voice was hard to hear. I stared at him in amazement, but he was looking down. ""Your number was up the first time I met you.”
^ just going to leave this quote with no explanation while I nod my head and make “yep” noises. It gets worse after this. The climax of the book happens during a baseball game playing during a thunderstorm. Bella is virtually kidnapped, have the vampires condescend her by acting shocked by her plan, is horrific to her father and then all she can think about is Edward. The girl is about the be killed and she is worried about Edward. Let’s remember Edward is a vampire. It is super hard to kill a vampire. Bella is a human – something very easy to kill. Okay, we got that? Awesome. It’s bad that even the writing of the book can’t give it any more credit. If the writing was good it may have made up for the horrific plot line. However, it’s bland. Everyone is bland. There is no personality to anything and for some reason simple mundane activities are described in the utmost detail. I could rant all day, but I have better books to. To say this re-read was a complete failure is an understatement. Pre-ReviewOkay, so you may see me making this as ""want to read"" in your feed. ""How could I have not read Twilight?"" You think to yourself. I have actually read Twilight. I remember borrowing it from the library as a mere 11 year old, excited for vampires since I'd recently outgrown my horse/unicorn phase. This book took over my life. This franchise was my guilty pleasure. I read it continuously. I would read each book and then start again. It was a serious problem. As in, during summer holidays where I couldn't borrow from my school library or my local library I would only read Twilight. I was 12 by that stage and I managed to be able to read the series in four days. So, where my siblings where riding their bikes and getting sun I was sucked into the world of vampires and love triangles that is laughable to this day. I have Twilight to thank for getting me into YA, however. So, I would love to do a re-read to see how currently aged me feels compared to 11 and naive Amber who was in love with Edward Cullen. ""Why haven't I rated this book if I have read it?"" Mainly because 11 year old Amber is trash and should not have any credibility when it comes to rating books. So, hopefully I can go on the journey that is Twilight again.",137,-0.9046,0.132,0.74,0.127,0.5534378629500579,NEGATIVE,0.9965
48,50299722,03/24/2009,1.0,"It's not as awful as its butt-awful sequels, but it's still pretty awful. But I think it's exactly what Stephenie Meyer was trying to create; tweenie soft-core. A prepubescent girl's wet dream. Sexy without the sex, romantic without the romance. After all, any 14-year-old virgin swoons over the hot guy who manages to be dangerous while safe, evil while angelic, hot while humble, overbearing while sensitive, sexy while sexless, etc. In other words, a guy who doesn't exist in any form, anywhere, ever. I'm trying to figure out the messages we're sending to young girls when we give them guys like Edward Cullen and support the idea that he's somehow ""dreamy"". 1) he's not human, 2) he's controlling and possessive, 3) he's a member of the army of the living dead who doesn't want to have sex because.....of his....morals.....I'm really tired of the moral preachings in YA romance fiction, and Twilight takes it to a level all its own because we're dealing with moral dilemmas and religious dogma in a book about vampires. Don't have sex before marriage, girls. Even if your dream guy turns out to be a soulless, blood sucking minion of hell. That doesn't mean you should let him get the milk for free. If he likes it, he'll put a ring on it, all that jazz. Let's brush aside the fact that I am a strong proponent of sex education and not shaming girls for their sexuality...even if I were a strong believer in waiting until marriage (I think you can guess I'm not), I still wouldn't understand this book. She's dating a fucking vampire. No, scratch that because Bella's a spineless imbecile, Edward Cullen is a fucking vampire who won't have sex with his girlfriend. It just doesn't make sense. Until you realize it was written by a Mormon. Then it makes so much sense, in such a chilling way.I'll admit I was roped in by this book at first. I actually sort of liked it.

While fairly entertaining, the writing is objectively not great, and Bella is one of the most insufferable characters I have ever witnessed. Seriously.

She continuously wonders why Edward is obsessed with her, because she's so (as she proclaims over and over again) ordinary and bland, and honestly, I'm wondering the same thing. Edward, what's up with that???? Also, Miss Stephanie Meyer did too much with the whole I'm so clumsy thing, like we get it, Bella is uncoordinated. With that being said, the book is less confusing than the movie, the chemistry is somewhat better, and I enjoyed reading the first half even though I knew what was going to happen.

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestEdit: typo 🦇 Read for the Unapologetic Romance Readers 
Halloween 2018 Reading Challenge
 for the category of: A romance about vampires 🦇 This is the one romance book that many men have deigned to pick up, even if just to look at the cover and sneer, and is frequently used as the scapegoat example to bemoan the romance genre as a whole as being a tasteless wonderland for idiots without brain cells, i.e. women. Because, as you might have noticed, anything that is marketed exclusively to women is frequently condemned by the ""general populace"" (i.e. men) as being without taste, merit, or worth. E.g. romance.My feelings about TWILIGHT could be mapped out as a series of complex dips and rises. I've always been really into vampires and remember seeing this book on Amazon back in 2006 - you know, back in the days when it only sold books and CDs - while looking for books about vampires to ask my mom to buy for me. Intrigued by the promise of dark romance, I clicked to read the Kindle sample and was a little surprised when the opening paragraph featured not vampires but some privileged bitch in an eyelet lace blouse whining about how she was exiling herself to one of the most beautiful places in the world as punishment.I remember thinking, ""Wow, this is dumb. Nobody is going to read this.""And that is why I am not a marketing executive.When the book became ridiculously popular, I was curious. Because I was a teenager, and if there's a demographic that's demonized more than women it's probably teenagers (e.g. teenagers are sheep, etc.). My mom bought me the book from Costco, of all places, and with no small amount of skepticism, I settled in to read. I actually stayed up until 3AM that night to finish it, and ended up getting only a couple of hours of sleep for the classes I was taking the next day. It was good. There wasn't a lot of action, but in a way that was kind of comforting. Bella was one of the first heroines that I really identified with - she was quiet and studious and socially awkward. She enjoyed reading and not just in that token way that makes her not like other girls; she wrote an essay on the misogyny in Shakespeare (a topic that I, myself, explored in one of my college essays). I also liked the fact that she seemed both jaded and naive; something that I, as a ""world-weary"" eighteen-year-old strongly related to. I burned through the second and third books (also purchased at Costco, thanks, Mom), and then noped out of the fourth book when I found out that there were things like baby soulmates, sex scenes involving pillow-eating, and weird science that involved giving vampires venom in place of bodily fluids and, for some reason, a different number of chromosomes that just so happened to equal that of the pineapple. (Let's all just take a moment to sit back and imagine a pineapple with fangs.)My point here is that TWILIGHT was easy to read and featured a generic heroine who had a quiet personality that didn't make me feel like I wasn't enough. After all, she was ordinary and got a GQ vampire boyfriend. Maybe that meant that being ordinary was okay. Many YA novels stress the quirkiness or the glory of their heroines, but I liked the idea of a ""plain Jane."" It was also my gateway novel to classic literature. I made my mom buy me copies of all the books Bella read or mentioned, which was how I ended up reading a slew of classics like JANE EYRE, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, and SENSE AND SENSIBILITY that year. For fun. I know, right?Then the movies came out and Kristen Stewart became the much-mocked star with her dead eyes and Robert Pattinson the questionable hero with his scoffing interviews and scruffy appearance. I wasn't happy with the casting choices and did not see the movie, but other people did. Many other people did. Suddenly the movie - and the merchandise - were everywhere and so were the fans. My god, honestly if anything put me off this book it was probably the fans. Especially the ones who tore forums apart with their vicious arguments over the battle that will go down in history long after everything else has crumbled to dust: Edward vs. Jacob? I found myself growing embittered against the book that I had previously enjoyed, and suddenly I could see all the problems with it that I had previously ignored. The relationship is toxic. Bella lacks agency. Grand sweeping gestures of ""love"" are expressed in the form of mortal peril. TWILIGHT also ushered in a whole new era of copycats, as everyone tried to write TWILIGHT with angels (FALLEN, HUSH HUSH), TWILIGHT with werewolves (SHIVER), and TWILIGHT with faeries (WICKED LOVELY or THE IRON KING).I decided to read this ten years later for a Halloween-themed romance challenge, and also to see how my perspective on the book changed with time. It is hilarious to me that Bella, with her limited experiences at the ripe old age of seventeen, sounds at many times like a weary Mormon housewife, speaking about her father the way one might express frustration about a husband (creepy), and about her mother as a child. She claims ignorance to social practices, and yet gives herself the advice that a Mom might, and lectures her friends about being rude or irresponsible. Also, who says ""Holy Crow!"" unironically who isn't either eighty years old or Mormon? Exactly.Edward is also significantly less attractive to me this time around. I think maybe it's because he smacks of the patriarchal, with his constant talking down to her as one might a child, and his sly winks about her being so young while seeming old, if you know what I mean, hurr hurr. That's a little creepy. All the claims about their relationship being unequal are valid; he is so much older than her that he has so much knowledge and experience and resources that she can never really aspire to be on equal footing. The relationship is skewed in his favor and he is, by his own admission, a master manipulator. It's also very creepy that he watches her sleep and knew without asking where she kept her house key. I'm still not over that. Even as a teen, I was kind of like, ""Um, hey wait.""I also never noticed that... um, Edward's taste in fashion is kind of bad? In fact, he dresses kind of like a sleazy 70s actor. I have receipts. Go through some of my status updates for the book and see what pics I paired with them. All that he's missing is a Ron Jeremy mustache. I guess this could also potentially tie into the whole ""30-year-old mom"" vibe if Bella is actually modeled of Stephenie Meyer and she's using Edward as a template for all of the heartthrob leading actors in movies that she watched growing up, which probably were from the 70s or 80s and probably featured questionable fashion choices like ivory turtlenecks and beige colored leather jackets.I do think that TWILIGHT changed the young adult and romance genres for the better, in that it showed people that things ladies like can not only enter mainstream pop culture, but also become raging successes that empower women not just to seek out and enjoy their own entertainment, but also to go out and create their own. I could say a lot of things here about some of those paranormal YA copycats and how I feel about P2P fanfiction that is repackaged as original fiction but this review is already getting pretty long, so let's save that for another day. Part of the reason it's so hated is because dudes had to confront the fact that a movie for women had entered their ""safe space."" There was no room in this world for them; the narrative was not about them. There aren't any guns or lasers in TWILIGHT and the ""action"" doesn't happen until the last 100 pages (unless you count vampire baseball or near-car accidents). It's an entirely character-driven romance between a female teenager and a vampire, and about how their relationship develops over 4.75 books (I'm counting that BREE book as .5 and MIDNIGHT SUN as .25, since it was never released). People love to demonize romance, and I still get comments from individuals telling me how stupid they think the books I read are, but honestly, TWILIGHT, like all romances, was just about escapism and having fun.3 stars",129,0.9909,0.102,0.773,0.126,0.5191591844369624,NEGATIVE,0.964
52,264743945,01/19/2012,5.0,"Third time reading. May 2020So I was feeling completely downbeat and just pretty lost in myself and decided to read Twilight for the third time. And I had a blast!The prose is cringey, I laughed when Meyer probably didn’t mean for me to laugh, and I swooned over Edward so many times that I’m sure I should be embarrassed... but I’m so not!This book is my go to happy place. It makes me feel young and hopeful... when in reality the big four-oh is glinting on the horizon and I’m pretty jaded about where my life’s path will take me. I know people often criticise this book for its unhealthy relationship between Bella and Edward ....and don’t get me wrong. They’re scarily obsessed with each other and it’s toxic AF and if I was parent, friend etc. to either character I’d be like guys y’all need to chill. But I don’t see it quite as negatively as popular opinion would have it. Yes Edward hangs out in Bella’s room while she’s sleeping. That’s just plain unacceptable. But I don’t feel he’s quite as controlling as many people seem to believe he is. I think Bella displays enough of her own self will and decision making skills to challenge that controlling stereotype. Ultimately Bella makes the main decisions about where she wants her life to go. We can disagree with those decisions as a reader and no doubt roll her eyes at her unrelenting stupidity (and lol at her constant horndogging) ... but she makes up her mind about what she wants from her life and Edward a blood drinking, bedroom creeping, moody-assed, sociopathic vampire is what she wants!I think we have to give younger readers of Twilight a bit more credit for knowing what they want from their books. Twilight is pure fantasy. It’s the ordinary, everyday girl (or in the case of Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined the ordinary, everyday boy) just dreaming that something otherworldly will happen to shake them out of their mundanities of existence. Do readers who love Twilight actually want a vampire to show creepy interest in them? I for one doubt that. Twilight is a safe space to fantasise and nothing more. And for many people, myself included, it’s a book that helps us escape from real world problems for a little while. I’m still leaving my rating at five stars even though the book is riddled with cliche and poor writing. And leaving it even though the climax is dull and disappointingly happens mostly off page. I could if I wanted to go off on any number of rants... but Twilight is above critique in my world because it gives me pure unadulterated laughs whenever I visit Forks. I’m looking forward to reading the rest of the main quartet this summer (and the Bree Tanner novella) before the arrival of Midnight Sun in August. Yes I have it preordered. No I will not be shamed! — — — — — I managed to somehow delete my old review for Twilight recently but luckily I found a draft copy of it stored in my notes so here’s some of that mashed up with some new thoughts and memories. I first read Twilight when I was at uni over the course of a Christmas break; I remember it had been a long and draining semester and my friend told me about this film that was coming out about a teenage girl who falls for a vampire and well I knew I had to read the book on which it was based! C’mon that premise is soooo cheesy how could I not wanna read it!!And read it I did. I remember going to the bookshop on my way home from my final exam of the semester and curling up with Twilight to relax that night... The next morning I returned to that same bookshop and bought the three remaining books in the series and binged the whole thing over a glorious week. I also dragged another friend to the cinema to watch the film with me...bless her she was unimpressed but I loved it and *might* have watched a dodgy online bootleg version of it later again that night... I’m not proud. Shouldn’t condone shady streaming. If it helps any I bought the DVD immediately when it came out...and the DVDs of the three other films as soon as each of those were released too....So what I’m saying is that I love Twilight. It’s a series that has given me immense joy over the years. When I’m feeling a bit down I throw on the DVDs and chuckle my way through them and I just feel better!And when back in 2017, the Goodreads book group I’m a member of decided to have a readalong of a Classic YA Novel well..... We could have gone with ‘The Catcher in the Rye’ or maybe ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ or possibly ‘The Outsiders’ to name but a few... but nope. Classy bunch that we are all voted to read (or reread as the case may have it) ‘Twilight’ because why not!!!And okay rereading it reminded me how truly awful Twilight is at times... It is so poorly written, the characters are utterly bonkers and say and do the dumbest things, the love story is beyond delusional and somewhat toxic... I mean ordinarily this is the type of book that I would award my lowest rating to and try to wipe it from my memory. But yet Twilight has this addictive charm. It's basically like the worst kind of sugary junk food. Something with excessively high glucose syrup content and a crap tonne of E numbers. I mean you know it's bad for you but you just want more more more!!!! Chapter 13 was the highlight for me. I cried. Just could not contain the tears. They freely streamed down my face as I laughed and laughed... And laughed some more!!! The second hand embarrassment I felt was overpowering (almost as overpowering as Bella's scent) But honestly if you want a book to cheer you up then read Twilight. Forget that you have standards. Leave your pretentiousness at the door. Embrace the dodginess and just revel in the trashtastic mess it is and let yourself enjoy the most unintentionally hilarious book you will ever read. I’m giving it the full five stars. Without guilt, shame or remorse. It’s simply given me too much joy over the years and therefore deserves my highest rating. #TeamEdwardForLife#BelwardAreRelationshipGoals#SparklyAbsAreMyFavouriteKindOfAbs

53,3341115347,05/17/2020,3.0,"For a very long time, I have been trying to persuade a good friend of mine to read The Ocean at the End of the Lane. She's not very well read and is convinced that Twilight is the best book in existence. So we made a deal, she agreed to read my suggestion if I read hers. And something weird happened, I actually liked it! Turns out she gave up on the Gaiman novel whilst I read this in one sitting. I don't consider myself a literary snob, I like to read a bit of everything, but I've always steered very clear of this one because it has a certain stigma attached to it. Everyone I know considers it trashy, but sometimes trashy can be a very good thing.So I'm a little bit surprised. And I must say, the interaction taught me that we should always read the (so called) bad trashy books ourselves before we jump on the bandwagon in favour of its infamy.

""Trust me.""""Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.""""I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you.""""If you're smart, you'll avoid me.""""Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.""2. ...but won't leave you alone.""I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.""""It would be more...prudent for you not to be my friend,"" he explained. ""But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella. Will you go with me to Seattle?""""I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.""3. You spend a lot of time being afraid he's angry at you...""Edward Cullen is staring at you,"" Jessica giggled in my ear.""He doesn't look angry, does he?"" I couldn't help asking.I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line.I parked on the narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraid because he was angry with me.4. ...because it's impossible to predict what will set him off.He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that I couldn't understand. We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves of infuriated disapproval rolling off of him, and I could think of nothing to say.And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable.I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung.""Exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do.""5. His behavior is very threatening...He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. ""Get in, Bella.""I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good.""I'll just drag you back,"" he threatened, guessing my plan.Holy crow!"" I shouted. ""Slow down!""""What's wrong?""""You're going a hundred miles an hour!""""Relax, Bella."" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing.""Your driving frightens me.""He rolled his eyes. ""Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving.""""As it happens, I don't mind being alone with you.""""I know,"" he sighed, brooding. ""You should tell Charlie, though.""""Why in the world would I do that?""""To give me some small incentive to bring you back.""""As if you could outrun me,"" he laughed bitterly.He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow.""I could kill you quite easily, Bella, simply by accident.""""I could reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake.""And then he was running.If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now.6. ...and he enjoys it when you're hurt or frightened.""Did I frighten you?"" Yes, there was definitely humor there.""Be careful,"" he warned as I struggled. ""I think you hit your head pretty hard.""I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear.""Ow,"" I said, surprised.""That's what I thought."" His voice, amazingly, sounded like he was suppressing laughter.""Just stay put for now.""""But it's cold,"" I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the sound.The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced.""Tender?"" he asked.""Not really."" I'd had worse.I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile.""I think I need help,"" I admitted. He laughed quietly.I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise.He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture of ease.""Oh!"" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.""I'm sorry."" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement.""You look awful,"" he told me, grinning.7. He constantly monitors your actions, your movements, even conversations with friends. He knows things about you he shouldn't be able to know.""I followed you to Port Angeles,"" he admitted.He reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame.""The door was unlocked?""""No, I used the key from under the eave.""I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was sure I'd never used that key in front of him.""I was curious about you.""""You spied on me?""He was unrepentant. ""What else is there to do at night?""""I come here almost every night.""I whirled, stunned. ""Why?""""You're interesting when you sleep."" He spoke matter-of-factly. ""You talk.""""It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind...her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that.""""All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to.""""Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition – unless you're afraid someone might steal it.""""All right,"" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he was planning, he'd never find it. [He totally finds it. We never learn how.]8. He's very possessive.His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away.""What?"" I demanded.""Newton's getting on my nerves.""""Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?""I nodded. ""The day you started talking to me again.""""I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt.""""I knew that if I continued to ignore you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry."" [He's talking about going away because he thinks he may not be able to stop himself from killing her. So, translation: I'd rather kill you than see you with someone else. Lovely.]""I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight."" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. ""To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned."" [To a guy who had the nerve to ask Bella out on a date.]""I'm not mad at Billy,"" he corrected in a clipped voice. ""But his son is irritating me."" [His son, Jacob, danced for a few minutes with Bella at the Prom.]9. He wants to know absolutely everything about you. Not in bits and pieces as your relationship develops, but right away.It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence.10. He insults you, denigrates you, and treats you like a child. ""Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.""""Do you want a ride to Seattle?""""With who?"" I asked, mystified.""Myself, obviously."" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talking to someone mentally handicapped.His smile was condescending now.""You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?""We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back.""Where do you think you're going?"" he asked.""Don't you have a jacket?"" His voice was disapproving.""Be careful. The child has no idea.""I bridled a little at the word child. ""Jacob is not that much younger than I am,"" I reminded him.He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. ""Oh, I know,"" he assured me with a grin.""Don't be difficult, Bella.""11. And he always has to have his own way. ALWAYS.""Honestly, I'm not hungry,"" I insisted.""Humor me.""He walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with an obstinate expression. Obviously, there would be no further discussion.""Drink,"" he ordered.""Tell me,"" he finally commanded after persuasion failed.Oh, wait. Vampires aren't real. This list won't help you check if your boyfriend's a vampire.It'll sure help you figure out if your boyfriend is abusive and/or a stalker, though. And sadly, those do exist.I'm not here to trash people who enjoy this book. I wrote this review because I'm worried about the girls who buy merch that says ""I'M JUST A BELLA WAITING FOR MY EDWARD."" Don't ever say or think that about yourself. Don't be that girl. Be a woman. Be a grownup. Write your own story. Don't depend on a guy to come along and do it for you.And for Pete's sake, if a moody, brooding guy says, ""I'm dangerous. You should stay away from me,"" say, ""You're right! Except actually, you'd better stay away from me. Or I'll drop some dynamite on your sparkly little dangler. Bye!""And then go have some adventures of your very own, and live happily ever after.",126,-0.9599,0.093,0.824,0.083,0.5948065823065823,NEGATIVE,0.9994
55,2555813720,09/02/2020,3.0,"Does anyone deny that this series normalises abuse for young, impressionable readers, is probably anti-feminist, and most likely racist? Not really, no.Is it still good entertainment? Hell yes!The Twilight phenomenon baffles generations of humanity (as it will aliens when they visit) with the contradictory emotions it elicits from the audience—some believe it does not deserve the hate, others believe it does not deserve the attention. While much has been said on why both sides of the argument have a point, allow me to add my own thorough tackling in my seven-part semi-essay reviews of the series. Of course, I will continue whether you allow me or not because I am unfortunately un-shut-able once I start to speak; I was just being courteous. The seven parts are:1) Introduction to Twilight: Why Loved, Why Hated 2) Twilight & Racism: Representative or Exploitative3) Twilight & Abuse: Feminist or Anti-Feminist4) Twilight & Blindness: Young Love or Parental Love5) Twilight & Gender Roles: Harmful or Harmless6) Twilight & Fantasy: Religious or Non-Religious7) Conclusion: What Twilight Could Have Been[parts 2-7 are in progress, please be patient]If you think this is the worst series EVA and its popularity nonsensical, you might want to read on. But if you think the hate for the series is extreme and incomprehensible and whatever problematic content are people talking about (no, I don’t mean the obvious stalking), you really really need to read on.

Introduction to Twilight: Why Loved, Why Hated 

In this essay, passive aggressive writing will be applied in order to distance intended message from any and all living creatures subject to lack of omniscient presence and therefore incapable of presenting a valid belief as proven fact—in other words, enlightenment will descend upon you without the agency of any earthly sentient being and thus you shall know things yet not know how you know them.Okay not really, this author will proceed to use the first person pronoun as a burgeoning weapon and so in this essay, I will analyse the entirety of the Twilight series so I will attempt to avoid or warn of spoilers if existent and I will gleefully talk for thousands of words and force said enlightenment upon you.Prepare yourselves, it now begins.

Why Is Twilight So Popular?

✦ Alluring, Well-Written Predator-Prey Dynamic: While Twilight might be one of the most geeky clean series out there (they don’t even go past first base until book four, and even then not a single part is graphically depicted), it’s in truth deliciously sexual beneath the surface—all about the “erotics of abstinence,” as one might call it. The meticulousness with which this quality is woven throughout this story, the perfection that is the capturing of that want and need and obsession despite the danger between the sick lion and the idiotic lamb, makes these books irresistibly and inevitably addictive and captivating—especially for teenagers. Because, however annoyingly triggering, Bella is a prey and, whatever safe mask he wears, Edward is a predator.✦ Edward the Heartthrob & Dramatic Romance: Meyer does indeed know how to write a page turning soap opera filled with dramatic declarations of love and vengeance and all the melodramas of teen addiction and infatuation—most evidently in a love triangle that, even though I have no aversion to love triangles, is better than most watery dilemmas of YA, as both sides are fleshed out and in the end it’s not the healthier relationship that wins.But more than that, it’s also about Edward. People who love Twilight are people who love Edward, because it’s as easy to love Edward as it is to love the series (and at 14 I did just that) the same way it’s as easy to hate Edward as it is to hate the series. He is attractive, tragic, charming, compassionate, fierce, and unbelievably self-sacrificing, yes, but he is not perfect or good or healthy. And Bella’s unreliable and biased narration is the POV of every smitten young girl who is blinded by obsession. When I hear someone adoring and praising him, I feel sucked into a well of grief. And when I look at their blind love—when I look at my own young self’s blind love—I want to somehow shake a tiny amount of sense into them—into us.I’ll explain more in a bit, bear with me.✦ Easy, Unnoticeable, YA Writing Style: Many critics have accused Meyer of not being to write to save her life and, even as I agree to some degree, I simultaneously happen to disagree. Blatantly, her writing is not magnificent or beautiful or a literary masterpiece, it just is, thus making the experience of reading Bella’s POV similar to listening to the thoughts of any coherent teenager, excluding the danger-seeking insanity. This is what turns her books into easy reads for teens or anyone newly setting out for the adventures carved on pages of wood or glass or whatever else humanity can come up with. ✦ Catchy, Easy-to-Love-or-Hate Characters: Meyer writes her characters for teens, indulging them and their simplification of people into friends versus enemies categories. Consequently, while none of her characters are exceptionally developed or life-like, they are rather like that catchy pop song that comes on the radio while you’re driving around town and you end up catching yourself singing along to—except for the rare occasions where every beat is an annoying assault of idiocy and lost potential; like Rosalie, for example.✦ I Mean, It’s White: Do you honestly think if a Black woman had written the same concept but about anything other than white angelic otherworldly perfect creatures while demonising the indigenous peoples, it would’ve become half as popular? Twilight is famous because it is comfortable and privileged. Yes, women have a hard time in the publishing industry, constantly belittled and pushed into Women’s Fiction, but White women have an easier time than POC ones. However much a fictional product of society race might be, it’s still a thing; and the fact that most world renowned authors are White European or American is not because they are more intelligent or creative.

Why Is Twilight So Despised?

✦ Problematic & Instalove-y Predator-Prey Dynamic: It’s a given that a relationship between predator and prey will be problematic, yet Meyer makes two huge mistakes that keep these series from being worthy of any true praise, (a) choosing the young adult genre (where, because of its impressionable audience, problematic content needs to be acknowledged, which Meyer fails to do) in place of the adult genre (where a more ambiguous approach fits into place, which even that Meyer doesn’t achieve), and (b) bringing love into the equation and failing so miserably at leading up to it. Indeed, this series could have been many things—things I will discuss in my review of The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner.✦ Edward the Abuser & Anti-Feminist Romance: When one says abuse, people’s minds usually think of a husband beating a wife, a father beating a child, etcetera etcetera, and that’s the issue—abuse is much more complicated and varied. Believe it or not, there are fewer mustache twirling evil guys going around plotting the oppression of women and games to play with others’ emotions than there are clueless souls accomplishing the aforementioned tasks. In reality, you could be an abuser and not know it; hell, I confess to having been one myself unknowingly years ago in addition to simultaneously watching my closest friend suffer in an abusive relationship, so I’ve had a front row seat to all its nooks and crannies.Calling Edward abusive doesn’t mean he’s any less a charming, compassionate, tragic, and misguidedly self-sacrificing heartthrob. It simply means he’s also a controlling, manipulative liar who repeatedly devastates Bella, beats himself up about it and apologises and promises not to ever do it again, then goes on to do just that. Through treating this aspect of his character as painfully romantic, Meyer helps the normalisation of veiled abuse for her teenage audience who do not spend much time reading between and behind the lines while forcing a previously independent quietly strong female character willingly into the most anti-feminist circumstances one could have come up with. This argument requires more clarification and evidence, which I will leave for my review of Eclipse. ✦ Poor, Occasionally-Laughable Writing: Above, you read me defend Meyer against the critics, here you will see me side with them. As I mentioned, her writing is akin to the thoughts of a teen—and since when has that made for a in-any-way praise-worthy book? Because oh watching Meyer attempt to write resembles a gangly boy going through his growth spurt trying to talk to his crush—no, walking to talk to his crush. I imagine it will involve a great amount of bruises. Thinking on it, it would be much like Bella attempting to walk on a flat surface. Admittedly, it does fortunately improve slightly with later books, but legendary lines such as this will forever be ingrained in my memory: Aro started to laugh. “Ha, ha, ha,” he chuckled. [New Moon, Chapter 21].✦ Lack of Depth & Layers in Flat Characters: Now back to that generic pop song I was telling you about. I like pop; no, I love pop. It’s no trap or alternative or jazz to me, yet I love it all the same. Despite that, there are pop songs that could have been so much more than just pop songs, and their very existence is a reminder of the artist’s failure. Meyer has too many of these songs out in the world AKA her characters, all so flat and one dimensional that they are the antonym of complicated in the dictionary. No, that’s not right—they have backstories that create the potential of for something more, but not a single one of them meets that expectation. Take Rosalie for one; a character with one of the most heartwrenching stories, acting like a shallow vain high school mean girl for centuries. Meyer and palpable character development are not acquaintances, that’s for sure. Only Edward experiences the least amount of development, and that is why I like him.✦ I Mean, It’s Racist: To be frank with you, this was a facet of the series I took a long time to clearly glimpse due to the fact that, well, don’t the sequels contain a tremendous amount of Native American representation? Ahh the foolishness of youth. Yours truly truly does dislike pointing fingers and is an advocate of giving all the benefit of the doubt, but even I have to admit something smells fishy.Not only does Meyer use the real Quileute Indian Tribe legends without providing any payment to its people living mostly in poverty (true cultural exploitation, which is in fact legal because American intellectual property laws do not protect indigenous peoples’ collective cultural property, except in very specific circumstances) she also portrays them as child abusers and terrorisers in place of including any accurate representation of their lives. This, on top of a proud Federation soldier, the good white angels versus the bad dark-skinned wolves, and Meyer’s refusal to let director Catherine Hardwicke pick a diverse cast unless, of course, the Black guy was a villain, all add up to the a no-longer ignorable picture: that Twilight is—subtly and rather cleverly must I add (as it is not obvious at first glance)—racist. For more thorough analysis, check out my review of New Moon.✦ We Live in a Misogynistic Society: You see, before anyone called Twilight racist or anti-feminist, it was hated for a baser yet more baseless reason—it was hated because it was simply a “girl thing.” It’s reasons like this that make me want to stomp my foot and declare my shameless love for the series, even though I never stomp my foot and I actually equally hated most things the books stand for. Except this. Never this.These 15,000 words were only me warming up; I am no way near finished, m’dears.

56,862817210,02/23/2014,5.0,"*Some Spoilers*Omg Twilight is the first book that taught me the love of reading, my first taste of the PNR world. This book is great. Edward is a super hott, very fast vampire who can read minds. Him and his family don't feed off humans, but instead only drink from animals.

Bella is pretty but shy, awkward, clumsy and stubborn. She is pretty much the parent to her mother. Which makes her very mature for her age.

 Bella moves to Forks to be with a father who she has not been very close to in years. She see Edward at lunch at school and wants him. Edward is confused as to why he can't hear Bella's thoughts. When they have their first class together he smells her for the first time, her blood sings to him. He has to fight the whole time not to kill her. This makes him feel such shame that he hates her. After running for 2 weeks Edward comes back and tries to stay away from Bella but they can't stay away from each other and end up falling in love“And so the lion fell in love with the lamb…"" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word.""What a stupid lamb,"" I sighed.""What a sick, masochistic lion.”

“You are my life now.” Twilight Had it all. I loved the whole book. Read it 7 times now beautiful love story. Great plot lots of drama and a hero to save the day. The Cullens are great you fall in love with the whole family, well maybe not rose lol.

Bella and her dad's relationship is great. The only thing I didn't love about the story was the fact that they sparkled. I get it, the writer wanted to do something different ,and it was different. The sparkling didn't take anything away from a great story . It will forever be one of my favorites.

58,826272324,01/17/2014,4.0,"* It’s not a bad book. It’s not the best book out there, but it’s not nearly as bad as everyone has made it out to be in the last years. I have certainly read way waaaaay worse books. Trust me, I still have nightmares.* The writing is decent. Yes, there are parts where it’s a bit redundant, but all in all, it’s fluid and it manages to keep the reader entertained and involved, up to the point where I didn’t feel the time pass as I was reading - which is exactly what I’m looking for in a book. And I actually enjoyed the descriptions. It doesn’t offer much on plot, but it’s a descriptive, character-driven book and that works for it.* Bella is not a one-dimensional character. She’s funny, she’s sarcastic, she’s smart, well-read, kind, and her biggest attribute is the love she has for those around her. Not only Edward, but her parents and his family as well. Her first thoughts when James lured her into the dance studio was that her mom and dad would be okay. She reacts negatively to the attention she gets from her peers in school because she wasn’t accustomed to it and it’s normal to feel scrutinized and to feel bothered by it. She’s clumsy, but hey, I once dropped a dustpan 4 times before handing it to my boyfriend. So it can be worse. And it’s certainly realistic (yes, I do trip on even ground, so I feel for her).* I really didn’t feel like Edward was the abusive boyfriend people made him to be. He made a conscious effort to stay away from her and he always put her safety first. Call me crazy, but that doesn’t seem abusive to me. And about the age thing - people did not throw such a fit about it when they watched/read The Vampire Diaries, where the age difference is bigger and Elena was in high school too. So there’s that. I do agree, though, that the “I watch you when you sleep” thing is problematic as hell. Like, no. Don’t do it.* “Nothing happens in this book”. - Twilight is, first and foremost, a love story. The center of the entire book is Bella and Edward’s relationship. Of course nothing much happens. Because it’s not about the action. It’s about the development of a relationship. It’s about the characters. I think their relationship progresses in a logical manner and it didn’t feel forced to me, honestly. It didn’t feel insta-love at all. Which is more than I can say for other books.* It’s a good book. And I stand by this. And I urge you all to give it a try before judging it.",114,0.9815,0.098,0.751,0.152,0.4845396825396826,POSITIVE,0.9989
59,26459304,07/06/2008,5.0,"Twilight follows what I think has become one of the great traditional plotlines: star-crossed vampire/human truelove. So, move aside, Jack London. In acknowledging my friend Ms. Meyer’s role in developing this new tradition, I feel like the first important thing to say is that Stephenie Meyer is not The Man. While most criticisms of the Twilight series are empirically true, it is nevertheless also true that this series is ubiquitously influential in culture right now, and I don’t think it’s influential in the same way as the War on Terror, or even Sarah Palin. The War and Palin are both The Man in ways that I refuse to believe Ms. Meyer is. I do concede, however, that Stephenie Meyer is a polished and packaged product of culture, and that she is the same package, in almost every way, as me. I don’t care about age or cynicism, I am the audience for this book. If you want to see my reaction summed up much more quickly than I plan to, I refer you to Paul Bryant’s Georgia . To introduce you more thoroughly to the audience for whom this book was written, I’ll start with a little summary of the story.Bella arrives, at the opening of the story, in the small town of Forks, Washington, and she’s not thrilled. She’s like, A little town, oh, it's a quiet village - ev'ry day like the one before. Little town full of little people, waking up to say, bonjour!She checks in at school, which is awkward because everyone’s staring and whatnot. They’re all, Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question, dazed and distracted, can't you tell? Never part of any crowd, 'cause her head's up on some cloud. No denying she's a funny girl that Bella.Even her father doesn’t really get her and goes around thinking, Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar. I wonder if she's feeling well. With a dreamy far-off look and her nose stuck in a book, what a puzzle to the rest of us is Bella!Even when she makes friends, they still just don’t understand that she’s an old soul – too old for dances and shit like that. Everyone still wants to be her friend, though, and they go around whispering, Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special, a most peculiar mad'moiselle. It's a pity and a sin, she doesn't quite fit in, 'cause she really is a funny girl – a beauty but a funny girl. She really is a funny girl – that Bella!If, after that brief summary, you don’t have a very particular song (and maybe some dance moves that you made up to go with the song at one time or another in your life) stuck in your head, then you are not the designated audience for Twilight. I’m not even intending to be disrespectful or critical when I say that the resonance people feel with Twilight is the resonance of Disney. It is the dividing line between those who fall in love with this story, and those who can’t stand looking at the cover art. Interestingly, though, I think most of the people who cringe at the mention of The Twilight Saga would still go see a new Pixar movie or even Beauty and the Beast if it was re-released on the big screen. It’s got the candlestick and the teacup, right? Who doesn’t like to see inanimate objects sing and dance? It’s just awesome. Disney, however, is totally The Man. Disney is, like, whatever is above The Man telling The Man what to do. I would call it The Superman, but I don’t want it to get a big head.Disney is smoother than Twilight because it knows that you can’t just present the story of a young, beautiful girl falling in love with a potential abuser without including a catchy tune and some dancing flatware. In that way, I guess it’s a mixed blessing that the movie version of Twilight is so freaking boring and awkward. It gives you time to reflect on whether it’s not a little convenient that our girl thinks it’s so groovy to have a vampire stalk her in her own bedroom. It lets you stop and think that undying for love might not be all it’s cracked up to be. The book version has lots of sparkles, though, and cars flying in every direction, so you don’t have to dwell on the unfortunate implications of the central relationship unless you’re inclined to. But, let’s face it, most of us have contemplated that at one time or another. If you haven’t, now’s your chance. What do you think about a cartoon that encourages little girls to stay in abusive relationships because underneath the gruff exterior of the abuser lies the heart of a prince? What do you think about a book that has women across the country swooning at a cadaverous stalker watching a teenage girl sleep?I’ll tell you what I think: it totally doesn’t bother me. I mean, if those aren’t the implications that the storytellers were intending (and I don’t necessarily think they are), then oops!, but that’s the extent of my criticism. On the other hand, I think it’s equally possible that those are the implications that the storytellers intended, and, if so, they are both pretty effective in being persuasive and single-minded in their goals. The messages might be sugar-coated, but they’re still obvious. They’re not sneaky or underhanded. I don’t like it when I feel like an author is trying to sneak around with themes, but if I just disagree, it’s not so bad. I think they’re good stories, too, despite their unfortunate messages, and they are made all the better by their singing and sparkles. Whether we like it or not, stories that idealize stalking and teach girls to try reforming their abusers through patience and fancy dresses are deeply ingrained in (at least) Western culture. It seems possible that these stories are even products of a conflicted nature in humanity. Men want the virgin/whore; women want the beast/god. But, also, none of us really want those people because they’re freaky. We don’t know what we want.(Arguably, the moral of Beauty and the Beast is that looks aren’t everything, and the moral of Twilight is that true love waits. I think those are less interesting messages within the stories, so I’m not going to address them. They are obviously there, though, so disagree as you wish.)Maybe there is a little Harold Bloom in all of us, mentally applying for the role of literary gatekeeper every time we read a book we don’t like. I have read criticisms of Twilight that are both hilarious and poignant, and, like I say, this book has a very specific audience. When I hear criticisms, though, they usually just make me really sad. A girl I know is a mother of three young kids and lives out in the middle of nowhere. At the time she read Twilight she was mostly staying home (again, in the middle of nowhere) and being a mom. She hated the book and had two criticisms. First, she thought that the clothes were really dorky (and, it’s true, the clothes are distracting). Second, every time she looked at Stephenie Meyer’s picture on the back, it bugged her because she thought about how Meyer is “just a mom,” as though a mom shouldn’t have a valuable voice in literature. I hate that on a lot of levels. I hate the idea of limiting literature to what I agree with, and I hate the idea of taking the voice of moms out of any part of culture. It also seems like a creepy excuse for nonparticipation to say that an entire group of people, to which you belong, shouldn’t be respected in the literary world. I’m not trying to say that Stephenie Meyer represents all moms, but I do think that a lot of criticism I have read of her writing either dismisses her as The Man or as a mom. It reflects the idea that literature should be a table at which only the cool kids sit – or at which the cool kids can’t sit. I don’t know who’s supposed to sit there. There are a lot of totally valid reasons to dislike any book. I recognize this book’s faults, but I think that one of its greatest strengths is that it was written by a mom. I think it is a fun, hilarious, action-packed story. I think that Stephenie Meyer has story-telling skillz and that you can’t teach that. Henry James might have had a big vocabulary, but he couldn’t tell a story to save his life. Ms. Meyer could benefit from reading the dictionary once or twice, but she already has what you need if you find yourself sitting around a campfire. Possibly, she could use just a dash of self-awareness, but too much self-awareness can ruin any good story – just look at Dave Eggers. Honestly, I would rather be brave enough to write Twilight than smart enough to criticize it.It’s funny to say, but this book actually inspired a real crisis of faith in my life. I’ve had some occasions where I’ve had major fallings out with God and then other occasions where I’m a big fan – like ya do. A crisis of faith is not unusual for me. There’s this thing that goes down in mainstream Christianity that is really annoying (I’m sure it happens in other religions, too, but I’m talking totally pop culture Christianity here so that my point makes sense). It’s this thing where people will frame a story as though the hero’s dreams are sure to fail, but then, suddenly, through the power of prayer, God swoops down and fixes everything in a magical money donation. Don’t get me wrong; magical money donations are the bomb. But does that mean that for those whose magical money didn’t come through, God’s showing that he’s angry with them? Does God speak in a reward/punishment system? I don’t think so, but I don’t really know anything about it. I know that in that situation, you’re supposed to say that God has a better plan, but that lacks something to me, also. To be clear, this isn’t a criticism that I’m making of religion in general, or even of Christianity in general, but of this Disneyland Christianity that is everywhere in America. It’s a religion of total convenience where everything has a vague, cliché explanation and, if it doesn’t, we don’t look at it. And the way people tell these stories is like they’re telling the plot of the newest movie about a down-and-out kid’s sports team. The stories are all informed by the plot development of Disney movies.Like this Disney filter, Edward and Bella’s relationship is very convenient. Edward is immortal and can give immortality. He watches over Bella. His desire for Bella is consuming both physically and emotionally. Bella’s maturity alienates her from other humans. She is physically vulnerable. She is smart and values passion over care for her life. Edward is the Disney god and Bella his disciple. I really don’t mean to be disrespectful when I say I’ve heard God and His people described just this way many times. I don’t know why I hadn’t really thought about this before I read Twilight, but from thinking about the silly convenience of the Edward/Bella relationship, a lot of real things fall apart for me. Like, if we believe that God is really real (not just abstractly real) and we think that God is with us all the time like Edward is with Bella, why isn’t that creepy? I know I think it’s creepy with Edward, but why not with God? I think it’s because we believe God is there when we’re thinking about Him and not when we’re not. I think Jesus has become a sparkly, romantic immortal with super-strength who thinks you’re so awesome he can’t take his eyes off of you and gives you cars sometimes. This is obviously a problem, but I think any generation will interpret traditional writings through a contemporary cultural lens, so it’s not shocking. It’s just, perhaps, not the lens most of us would prefer. On the other hand, if we think we’re completely alone when we aren’t with humans, no possibility for anything supernatural or spiritual, that seems limited and conveniently clean, too. I don’t have an answer, and it seems like it’s not really possible to have an answer that’s not annoyingly convenient on some level. Also, I'm not saying this because I think Stephenie Meyer invented the Disney Jesus, but because I think it helps explain Twilight's resonance in society. I think Meyer expressed something very simple that both culture and religion have prepared people to receive.It is probably important to say, again, that I’d be surprised to find out that Stephenie Meyer is part of a vast conspiracy to subdue Western civilization by reducing our worldview to clichés. Plus, I think that when someone’s worldview is a cliché, patronizing them out of it isn’t really the way to go (yeah, you know who you are. No, not you – you in the back. That’s right). Also, what do I know? Maybe, Jesus really is sparkly and has a warehouse full of new cars. It is just as legitimate to say that I don’t believe that because I don’t want to as that someone else believes it because they do want to. *sigh*This may seem backwards, but I started reading Twilight in the mood for something fun and silly and not well written, and so I enjoyed (almost) every minute of the series. In a more anti-Disney mood, I probably I would have wanted to burn them for the weak and whiny heroine and glorification of stalking. I think of these books like the show Friends, though. Everything works out well for everyone by the end of the episode, and so despite appalling personal choices and caricatured personalities, the stories are comforting. I don't know whether I think it's worse to be comforted by stories that present unhealthy worldviews, or to expect books to represent literal reality. Both seem suspicious, but the first seems more fun. I appreciate and think it's hilarious that Meyer loves her characters so much that she'll sacrifice anything in the plot to make things turn out well for them. I never feel like she is trying to impress me, but only writing what she wants have happen.The main criticism I hear of these books is that the love story is completely unrealistic. This is absolutely true, but it is also a series about vegetarian vampire superheroes, so I think it's important to have a little perspective about realism. I hope that we are not so culturally bankrupt as to go to Friends for dating advice or vampire stories for authentic representations of love. Unfortunately, we actually might be that bankrupt, and I sadly acknowledge my own experience with teen girls and grown women taking these books VERY seriously. I am reluctant, however, to be angry with books I thought were so silly and fun only because of other people being silly in a not fun way.To conclude, I’m planning to petition Tim Burton to do a song-and-dance version of the Twilight movie. It will be awesome. For the vampires, we will cast all professional dancers, and for the normals we’ll cast normals. I mean, we gots a meadow scene, fast cars, and a baseball scene in here! Not to insult the My Dinner With Andre version, but my version is going to kick ass. We’ll throw in a little irony, music up the melodrama, and show the haters what a story looks like.

60,31264603,08/26/2008,1.0,"ATTENTIONPictures have been fixed, hopefully for forever.Right. This is going to be totally tongue-in-cheek, or at least mostly, because I don't feel like saying what's already been said about this book. If you want to know how I feel about the technical/storytelling aspects of this book, go read any of the numerous articulate, well-written one-star reviews. The one thing I will say is: I still like Alice. She was my favorite character when I liked the books and the only one I consider worth the while now. Pity the book isn't about her. Jasper is okay, but not as interesting or fun as she is.Anyhow.The point.TEN REASONS THE ELEVENTH DOCTOR IS HOTTER THAN EDWARD CULLENSetting aside, for the most part, the obvious fact of physical hotness of actors.Because really, this:[image error]cannot hope to compete with this:Ever.Okay, okay, minor fangirling episode aside, the actual list. Oh yes. Illustrated as much as I could manage, but some things just aren't possible.10. Eating fish custard is much cooler than drinking blood.Here's the thing: vampires are old hat now. And by 'now' I don't just mean in the wake of the craze Twilight itself created. I mean that there was already an adult PNR before this book even came along. Vampires, drinking blood, all that stuff - been there, seen that, and seen it better. Now, Timelords are a different thing. While Who is the second longest-running TV show in the world, it never gets dull. (I choose to ignore Love and Monsters for purposes of this review.) Vampires, no matter how many 'new takes' you have on them, do. Heaven knows I roll my eyes a bit now, and I've read a lot of different ideas about them. I would have liked this book ever so much more if Edward and his family had been some sort of original creature. Also, that would have required more work of Ms. Meyer, and more work might have produced a better final work.Also, fish sticks and custard are much tastier than blood. Just sayin'.9. Eleven looks amazing with a bow tie.(Don't deny it, he does.)The real point of this is: the Doctor actually acts like an old-fashioned gentleman. In every sense of the word. Sure, Edward holds car doors for Bella. But he still invades her privacy and watches her sleep, and he still takes advantage of her hormones. The Doctor, on the other hand, has class. He is infallibly polite, except to his enemies, and let's be honest: would you be polite to xeoncidal alien races? Thought not. He doesn't invade his companions' privacy. He doesn't take advantage of Amy's hormones, even when she makes it reeeeeally easy. And sure, some of that is because he's awkward around women. Some of it, though, is because he's been around long enough to learn some goddamn manners. Edward could do with a few lessons.8. He has mad dance moves.And he's not afraid to show it. My point here is that Eleven has a genuine personality. He has interests that don't relate to the females in his life. He has his own goals unrelated to them; he doesn't dote on them (though he does care for them); he isn't full of happy coincidental interests. Inasmuch as Bella has interests, Edward shares them. The rest of his time and mind power is pretty much spent on her. Excuse me while I gag - okay, all better.Also, Edward doesn't seem to me like he knows how to have fun. Seriously.7. He's Space Gandalf.This goes back to the personality thing, and also the not getting boring thing. I mean, how could Edward describe himself? He calls himself a monster a few times - wonderful, very sexy, loving the self-hate - and he's popularly called a sparklepire. Now, let's look into these. Space Gandalf pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the Doctor: very, very old, very wise, very powerful, kind and self-sacrificing, and more concerned with the big picture. What do we learn from the world 'sparklepire'? Well, that he sparkles... and he's a vampire. The 'monster' thing tells us he's emo. Bottom line being: the Doctor is much more interesting than Edward. Much, much, much, much more.6. He has a much cooler ride.Do you know what that little thing in the left corner is? It's the U.S.S. Enterprise. Remember how huge that ship is? Yeah, it's drawn next to the full TARDIS structure to scale.I'd take that over a silver Volvo any day. 5. He'd rather travel space and time than watch sappy movies. Edward makes most of his goal in life to 'keep Bella safe'. And he does so by not letting her really live it up. The Doctor, on the other hand, owns up to the fact that his life is dangerous - and then offers to take people with him anyway, because he has faith in their personal strength. Edward treats Bella like a hapless child. The Doctor, to whom the entire human race can be rather childlike, treats his companions like adults. He doesn't assume the worst of them, but the best. He is a positive force, whereas Edward uses his supposed fear of Bella getting hurt to keep her where he wants her - and acts as a source of negativity in that way.4. He defeats his enemies with words alone.For this I have not a picture, but a video: here.Edward has to use physical force to tear his opponents apart, and then he has to set them on fire. All the Doctor has to do is talk them down. Is there any question who's more badass here? Because if there is, newsflash: true badassery comes not from being the most violent or physically forceful thing around, but from being so determined and unstoppable that no one even wants to engage you in a fight in the first place. 3. He is clearly better at attracting women.This:or this?First off, Amy is hotter than Bella could ever be. But that's not all. Bella, as I kinda mentioned above, has little to no personality. She hates Forks. She likes Jane Austen. She's apparently smart, though she doesn't act that way. She mothers her own father, and she's SO IN LOVE with Edward. Amy? Amy is curious even as a young girl. She has a sense of wonder. She is tenacious - just ask those four psychiatrists who tried to tell her the 'Raggedy Doctor' wasn't real. She has a powerful, persuasive personality. She loves Rory, and she makes it clear that she doesn't want to live without him, but not everything in her life is about him. Most of all, she saves the Doctor and herself several times. Locked up by aliens? Pick locks and break the hell out. Good friend about to walk the plank into shark-infested waters? Grab a cutlass and save his life. And yeah, she doesn't always make the right choices, but at least she does things. Partly, Bella's problem with not doing jack comes from the fact that the people she would have to fight are a trillionbajillion times stronger than she is, but partly it's because she's a wuss. Amy has drive, goals, curiosity, desires beyond being with her man forever. She, unlike Bella (and this drives me APESHIT on Bella's side) actually values her friends.If I got in a fight and I had Amy Pond and Bella Swan with me, I'd toss Bella to whoever we were fighting and then do my best to kick ass as well as Amy would.Also, it bears noting: someone goes creeping in Amy's house and she hits him over the head with a cricket bat and handcuffs him to a radiator. Someone goes creeping in Bella's house and she thinks it's smexy.2. He can rock a fez.There's no deeper meaning to this one. Just - look at Eleven in that short-lived fez, and then look at Edward in the same sort of headgear:Yeah. NO.1. He saves the whole world, not just one pathetic girl lacking survival instinct.When the guy tops io9's list of characters who've saved the world the most, you know he pwns everyone else.However.This is also a matter of scale.I mean, Edward is pretty much immortal, right? And he's all strong, fast, able to read minds, etc. So why isn't he doing something for the greater good? Yes, yes, can't go outside in sun because he sparkles, I know, but there are other things he could do. He's been through high school and college quite a few times; couldn't he be working on a cure for cancer? Or genetically engineering crops to fix world hunger? Or in some way actually contributing to the planet? See, you can tell me that Edward Cullen is a good guy, but the fact is he's a pathetic little coward who hides in his corner of the world and refuses to use his gifts to help the rest of the planet and those who are suffering. As for the Doctor, his whole mission in life is to help the world. In one season, he saved the world four times. FOUR. TIMES. He manages to see both the big picture and the small picture, both the personal crises and the lives that need changing and the massive invasions or conflicts. He is not a coward. He does not hide. He fights his own battles and he wins.Want to convince me that Edward is a hero? Put him on the big stage and show me his shine. (or his sparkle, I suppose.)I should note that while I hated Robert Pattinson as Edward for many reasons, I won't bear him permanent ill will unless he screwed up Water for Elephants. I do like making fun of his portrayal of Edward, and I find him distinctly unattractive.In conclusion:Original review:(view spoiler)[The first time I read it, I liked it.The second time, which directly followed the first, I liked it.Then I took some time off to catch up on the rest of the series. New Moon had me up until two in the morning (though in my own defence I read a chapter of it, a chapter of Silent Spring the whole time). Later, at camp, finding a friend reading it, I borrowed it and flipped straight to one scene to re-read it, just 'cause.Eclipse was okay, and I was fine with Breaking Dawn on first go-through. (Another all-nighter, on principle this time.)My problem with Twilight is much less its story (though the sparklepires are dumb beyond expression) and much more its fanbase. It does not deserve this screaming, plauge-of-locusts-like fanbase. Hell, no book deserves that- and this is coming from someone guilty of rabid fangirling, so no grain of salt required.Eventually, when I've run out of good new things to read, I'll get back to Twilight and give it the thorough, mostly unbiased review all books deserve. I will not read Cleoland before reviewing. I will not read Cleoland before reading. I will not even touch Ferretbrain. I will simply sit down with the book some lazy summer day when I should be writing or hiking or doing AP homework and read it and make notes.But not now. And probably not this summer.

62,1429780719,10/31/2015,1.0,"I read this book for the first time ever at the age of 29. I flat out refused to read it before this point because I thought it was cool to be counter-culture and then because I heard so many people talking about how awful it was. Enter the 10 year anniversary and a project I put together for Snark Squad. We spent a month doing chapter-by-chapter recaps that you should definitely check out if you really want to know what I thought about this book. Also, to counter-balance the fact that I was reading this book as an adult with an eye specifically toward criticizing it, I put together a series of vlogs asking people to share their own Twilight experiences with me. The first video is about introductions to and first impressions of Twilight and the second video is about the Twilight fandom. So what did I think about this book? It was really, really bad. I believe there are only a few people out there left who won't admit that this is bad, at least in one way, shape or form. Sure, there are still fans, but I think that anyone who values the English language or effective storytelling has to admit to themselves that this was pretty damn bad. First and foremost, the writing is awful. If you ask me if this is the worst book I've ever read, I'd say no because it isn't quite as offensive as some other things I've come across. The writing, though? Yeah, probably some of the worst. Meyer pads out a practically non-existant plot with so much repetition and useless description. She constantly confuses her own meaning because she cannot effectively build sentences or employ punctuation. Most of the time, her sentences are like clown cars, absolutely packed with words, dashes, ands, commas, and descriptions of Edward's perfect face. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. What the hell? Your eyes aren't blue and your hair isn't red, despite the constant sunshine? Wait, your skin was ivory even though it didn't have red hair to excuse it? HUH?“I was trying so hard not to think about him, and what Angela had said… and more than anything trying to beat down my hopes for Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful than the rest, when I looked up to see someone’s silver Volvo parked along the street and it all came crashing down on me.” YES. That IS an ellipsis in the middle of a sentence with almost 60 words, three commas, three ‘and’s, and a silver Volvo in a pear tree.“I had a good loud scream, and I sucked in air, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry.” She sucked in air AND PREPARED TO USE IT. “Okay, air! I hope you are reeeaa-dy!” “Why do you think you can’t hear me?” I asked curiously.”  I asked... CURIOUSLY. lolforever. “I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me."" His eyes are located somewhere beneath his arms and clenched hands apparently. Stephenie uses a crap ton of cheatery narration to tell her story. The story is in the first person, from Bella's point of view. Bella, THE LEAST OBSERVANT PERSON OF EVER, knows things she couldn't possibly know. Edward was constantly throwing her the briefest of looks and she would spend paragraphs telling us what that one GLANCE meant. That is CHEATING. That's crappy storytelling and also it makes me angry. He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest – it was as if she had called his name, and he’d looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer. How does someone look like if someone has called their name and they've already decided not to answer IN ONE SECOND? They don't because this is just awful foreshadowing since Edward can read minds. Hooray. “As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmet expectation."" Quick, everyone practice your one-second-unmet-expectation face. What? That doesn't actually mean anything? Right, because the unmet expectation is that Edward can't hear Bella's thoughts so this is more cheating.Bella is the worst. I almost feel bad saying that because she's also suicidal and depressed, though I don't know if the author knows that or made her that way purposefully. She is the worst narrator ever because she never knows what's going on. There were too many times when things were happening to Bella and then she would be like, ""oh, I didn't realize..."" She was only ever REALIZING things right in the middle of doing them. That's a stupid character quirk but just beyond that, think of it from the perspective of the narration. BELLA, YOU ARE TELLING ME THIS STORY. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, NEITHER DO I. Bella was really awful to everyone around her, including all the kids at Forks High who were incredibly welcoming. She had zero sense of self-preservation and made terrible decisions overall. She complained about EVERYTHING. Even things she liked had some negative filter. When the sun finally shows up in one of the opening chapters, she makes sure to tell us though that ""it's in the wrong place in the sky."" HOKAY. Can't just enjoy the sun? No? Okay.I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. Don't tell me how ""perfectly common"" the name Jessica is when you just spent a chapter ""forgetting"" the damn name. We get it; you are awful. A normal reaction from Bella when Edward misses school one day, after a week or two of knowing each other:“A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach…” pg 145“With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria…” pg 145“Desolation hit me with crippling strength.” pg 145“I shambled along behind Jessica…” pg 145“…while spiraling downward into misery.” pg 146“I realized I’d been holding on to a last shred of hope…” pg 146“…felt a new wave of disappointment.” pg 146“The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally.” pg 146“I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope…” pg 146Edward is equally awful, especially as a love interest. I do not get the appeal of dating a hundred year old seventeen year old that feels like an ice sculpture. He spends the entire book treating Bella like crap, most of it under the guise of ""keeping her safe."" In case you were wondering, that is indeed from chapter one of The Abusive Boyfriend's Handbook. Edward is at best bland and at worst a murderer. He spends the first half of the book telling Bella that he wants to kill her and it's all so damn casual that I can't imagine why anyone, at any age, fell in love with him. I mean, we all know that when he's going on about how he could hurt Bella, that's code for, ""I want to suck your body dry of its blood,"" right? Okay, cool. “I couldn’t understand why. How you could hate me so quickly…”“To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me.” MEET CUTE.“He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one (tear) I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn’t be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it.” Hope you weren't saving that tear for later, girl!“Be careful, though. The child has no idea.”I bridled a little bit at the world child. Jacob is not that much younger than I am,” I reminded him.He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. “Oh, I know,” he assured me with a grin.” Alright, pedobear. Calm down.THERE IS NO PLOT IN THIS BOOK. NOTHING. They literally just keep breathing erratically around each other, start dating for a couple of chapters and then some nonsensical other vampires show up and suddenly want to kill Bella because she smells like a blood-cake or something. I DON'T KNOW. The entire ending ""climax"" (can it BE a climax if there is literally no build-up) makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.We only briefly hear about the Quileute Nation in this first book, but it's worth reminding everyone that when Meyer Googled ""rainiest city in the US"" she found Forks and the Quileute Nation. She then bastardized their legends and history for her fictional work and goes on to treat them in a very othering manner. That's not okay. And while we find a veritable treasure-trove of snark material within Meyer's story, it's always worthwhile to pause and point out that there is also a lot of sexist and racist bullshit in here as well.So basically read this if you want a story about an abusive, possessive love between a depressed young girl and the old may who preys on her. Set in high school because what the hell else do rich, super powered vampires have to do but take biology over and over, am I right?",103,-0.9993,0.175,0.72,0.105,0.5342714101144334,NEGATIVE,1.0
63,2444871674,07/03/2018,2.0,"A decade ago my niece and I decided to binge read this series and then see the movies. (I was drunk and living the end of my glorious 20’s so you may imagine I was also moron! My niece was 13 at that time and puberty, excessive junk food consumption might have hit her hard and killed some brain cells as well!)So at the end of this experience I wanted to hire a contact killer to end my pain and guess what: my niece loved books and adored the movies. (Can you imagine that charming vampire is gonna be Bruce Wayne! And that brilliant girl is gonna be Charlie’s Angels and the hottie wolf man is gonna be nothing! No! I didn’t! Remember! I was moron at that time, writing nonsense TV sitcom scripts! But I’m still sorry for Anne Kendrick who had a temporary memory loss and insisted that she had no idea she was in the movie! And Michael Sheen, why was he in the movie at the first place?)So a decade later, we decided to another niece-aunt reading challenge. This time both of us were drunk and after watching three seasons of Black Mirror at one seat, we lost the rest of our brain cells because of over usage! So we said let’s do it again. Let’s read the books! Let’s give team Belward another chance! Why not? Maybe we’re pretentious book nerds who don’t have a real taste about books!Maybe maturity will change my mind! The movies still suck but the books may capture your mind and help you to see the story from different perspective by seeing things from the characters’ minds.So we started our reading after few pages later, my niece started to bang her head to the wall and screamed: “Get this thing out of my hands! Heeelppp!”But the good thing is we had great time when we’re watching the movie. This was the strangest experience for me like seeing Anna Hathaway and James Franco as Oscar hosts!So third time is charm! Maybe a decade later we start to love these books and Taylor Lautner’s acting performance! Nope! Not a chance!But that was my opinion! I know there are so many die-hard fans of the series and as I said before books are subjective. So please don’t throw rotten eggs from my window! Actually none of you did something like that! My sister in law did but it’s another story to tell at another review ! What can I say? Everyone has its own taste and own point of view. I truly respect the fans’ opinions. But I think I love darker vampire stories, world building and complex characters so I’d better stick with Anne Rice and Charlaine Harris’ books.So let’s pass this one and rewatch Interview with vampire and see Tom Cruise is real life vampire because he looks exactly same right now after nearly two decades later!",103,0.9919,0.063,0.809,0.128,0.5194337194337194,NEGATIVE,0.9998
64,19316098,04/02/2008,5.0,"I got a pre-emptive notice regarding this book from my older sister-in-law. I thought it was too funny not to share:""I read this book because (13 year-old) had been told it was such a GOOD book. She read it and really liked it. So then I read it and the rest of the ones in the series. As a mother I had a couple of ""issues"" with this book. It is very romantic and they talk a lot about being SO in love. I had to explain to her that men do not talk like that. Second of all, he should NOT be spending the night with her - even if nothing happened. Third of all, just because he is trapped in a 17 year old body, he is still 80+ years old. Why would he be so attracted to her? I enjoyed the book, but as a mature 40+ year old, I can see it for what it is - a fun, good read. I worry about all the young teen girls who read this and think this is what and how love is. I hope they have someone to help bring them down to earth. It would be nice if love were really that great and men expressed them selves so freely, and you could always feel that pitter-pat in your heart, but from my years of experience it's just not like that. Sorry to dash your hopes - maybe it's like that for you. Enjoy the book and the others that follow. It was a quick fun read, though.""~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I found that these books speak to that teenage heart hiding deep within my ""tainted by the real world"" exterior and I get great enjoyment out of going back to that part of me that I miss a great deal.I relate to the main character in the story ""Bella"" she is an awkward teenager who doesn't always see herself as others see her and has a hard time seeing why ""Edward"" the drop dead gorgeous vampire would want anything to do with her. True, the boy I loved in high school wasn't a drop dead gorgeous vampire, but he was beautiful to me and took my silly teenage heart for granted and walked all over it, but that's enough about him for now.So here I go on my views and a few things I would like to address:~*~*~“It is very romantic and they talk a lot about being SO in love. I had to explain to her that men do not talk like that.” About this book being very romantic and all the talk about being SO in love - well - It hasn't been too long since I was a teenager myself .....  As a young teen girl that is ""what and how love is"". Saying ""that's not love"" is one thing, but to a teenager that is IT. I have volumes of poetry and stories that I have written on this exact topic. Go to any teenager and they probably have the same.As a teenager I believe that we feel/felt things more deeply and experienced more in those few short lived years of our life the I think we ever will again. I loved more deeply/lustfully/openly/truly/vibrantly in my 3 years of high school then I have any day since then, and before anyone gets all offended I will clarify that REAL love, ETERNAL love and the SECURITY of love shared with a spouse or family or friends is completely different, but no less true or electric.No, in real life men don't talk like that, but sometimes the men in our heads do. Who hasn't had a conversation with a man in their head and every word that came out of his mouth was sweet and romantic and full of feeling and truth? I'm sure most women have. Just because the men we are with on a daily basis don't talk like that it doesn't mean we don't want them to. :)“Second of all, he should NOT be spending the night with her - even if nothing happened.” The ways of LDS youth are not always the ways of the world, and just because the book was written by a former BYU student doesn't mean that the pages need to be dripping with gospel doctrine and perfect morals. That's Jack Weyland's job. She was writing a book for large publication where in a lot of places and to a lot of people this morality is the norm. When I was 17 I spent the night with a boy - nothing happened, we shared a twin-sized bed at a sleep over where one of the only reasons I went was because it was his sister, at his house. Was it right? probably not. Did anything happen? he kissed me. Did my parents know? they do now. Do I feel guilty about it? no. Am I the only LDS girl who has ever done this? Absolutely not. Does that make a difference? no. Does this make me a bad person? No. Face it. Teenagers do things because we can and because we want to, not because our parents tell us to.“Third of all, just because he is trapped in a 17 year old body, he is still 80+ years old. Why would he be so attracted to her?”Yes, he's a vampire. Yes, he's 80 + years older then her, but is it more appropriate for that said vampire to date a 17 year old or should he bee looking to the older women in the 40 + still looking like a 17 year old? Just because he'll live forever doesn't make him any less needy then the rest of us and perhaps his body and his feelings are stuck in that perpetual 17 year old state. (why am I defending a fictional character?!)""It would be nice if love were really that great and men expressed themselves so freely, and you could always feel that pitter-pat in your heart, but from my years of experience it's just not like that.""Eventually we all grow up. Even though this book gives the illusion of ""what love is"" and that teenage girls will believe it ... Eventually we all grow up. What is the harm in believing that maybe somewhere this kind of love is possible and that the person you choose to spend eternity with will love you deeply and electrically and unconditionally? Shouldn't that be how life is? That's how I love my soul mate, it's not always perfect, but it is deep and true and I hope it stays that way.",93,0.9998,0.068,0.696,0.235,0.498795775528059,POSITIVE,0.968

66,3334686318,06/03/2020,1.0,"Was I aware, going into this, that I was much too late to jump on the Twilight bandwagon? Yes. Was I also aware that there was a big chance I would hate this book with a passion, and might want to obliterate said bandwagon? Yes. Did I read it anyway, to see what all the late '00s craze was about? Yes!Twilight... Ended up being one of the worst books I've ever read. I won't even be adding quotes in this review, because I couldn't find a single sentence worth quoting — which brings me to the topic of Meyer's writing style. Now, I am well aware that this book was written with a teenage/YA target audience in mind. It's obvious that the writing isn't supposed to be anything literarily groundbreaking. But I have read middle grade fiction written in a more attractive way than this. It's all tell, no show, there's a constant repeat of descriptions (it feels as if half of this 500-page book consists of descriptions of Edward's perfect, melted honey, sugary caramel, glistening, glowing, gazing topaz eyes that twinkle in the moonlight), and every sentence has an empty feel to it.Edward Cullen is a stalker. Or a sociopath. Or both. He acts stand-offish to everybody but Bella and his family, his behavior toward Bella is oftentimes manipulative and domineering, and he has quite an impulsive nature. One could argue that these character traits stem from the fact that he is a vampire, but I didn't catch Alice (or any of the other vampires) watching people sleep and secretly following them into other towns...There are more problematic elements to this story. For example, what is with the whole white-skin obsession? Bella keeps rambling on and on about how incredibly pale she is, and how she'll never fit in anywhere with such white skin. Excuse me? SHE IS WHITE. She is also moving to a town notorious for its incessant clouds and rain — she should know that that will snatch her not like other girls wig straight off her pale, pale head. What I find weird is the fact that she also couldn't stop jabbering on about the beauty of Edward's white, white, very white, incredibly white, extremely pale skin. What a paradox. How does this make sense?The romance had me cringing so much. Bella thinks she's independent because she can fend for herself (she can cook, mind = blown) but every time Edward turns up, she turns into a dramatic damsel in distress with no brain cells. Not that she uses her brain when he isn't around — it just gets worse when he is. The girl only wants to live for Edward, and it is UNHEALTHY. She even takes drugs to get to sleep, because she can't stop thinking about him and his perfectly chiseled face. I also have to mention that Bella immediately thinks Edward regrets saving her life when he states that it'd be better if they weren't friends. I present to you...
Bella's Logic
Edward saved me from being hit by a car.Edward now says we shouldn't be friends.I can come to no other conclusion... He doesn't want us to be friends. Therefore he wishes I got crushed to death.Here is some more ranting about Bella. Because my GOD, she is a frustrating main character. She has no compassion whatsoever. She doesn't even have decent manners. Every single student in Forks is nice to her and can find something halfway satisfactory in her personality and the way she acts, but all she does is bring them down. She is incredibly prejudiced, and mostly forms her opinions based off of the appearances of people around her. Somehow, her petulance and the one-sentence answers she gives to everyone's questions are enough to have about five boys craving her attention. She treats her friends like trash (can we avenge Mike, please?) and she doesn't have any respect for her father. She describes herself as 'so clumsy she's almost disabled' (indirect ableism?) and this clumsiness seems to be her only personality trait.Even the pacing was off. How can the 'Edward is a vampire' reveal scene have any impact, when it drags on for much too long? Don't even get me started on the ending. I was hoping it would redeem the book, but it was so boring!If you couldn't tell, I do not like this book.---------------Additional Notes:- Please take this review with a grain of salt- Why do I feel like watching the movie adaptations now- Somebody please stop me- Oh no",91,-0.977,0.123,0.784,0.093,0.3980351473922902,NEGATIVE,1.0
67,2214958780,12/15/2017,2.0,"I read this book for the first time about a decade ago. It took me no time to finish it (it’s an easy read) and even less time to dislike Bella (she’s easy to detest).Now it’s my niece who’s reading the book (she just turned 13) and I’m re-reading it alongside her, to talk to her about the ideas it proposes (the vampire-werewolf thing doesn’t worry me at all, it's the whole underlying set of ideas about “what a good girl is and must do to remain a good girl” that urges me to establish a dialogue with my niece).Meyer was extremely successful in spinning vampires into alluring creatures who deserve our love. Of course, the vampires she shows us as role models have been able to control their lust for blood (and other things) and are now pretty much super good-looking humans who live forever. Far behind are the Bram Stoker’s Draculas who drank human blood and perverted good women. Almost as forgotten are Rice’s Louises and Lestats, sensual and indulgent. The only thing Meyer takes from Rice’s vampires is their tortured nature. And no one is as tortured as Edward (Bella’s ultimate love interest), who lives his un-dead life regretting having losing his soul (still, there’s no clear reason of why he suspects not having a soul since vampirism here is presented as something like a virus that takes over bodies, transforming humans in superhumans, which—to me—feels like saying you could lose your soul from a bad case of the flu, but let’s not dig into the many inconsistencies of this new teen-friendly vampire tale where there are more important things to talk about).First, let’s talk about the fact that Bella is a teen, not even 18 yet, and Edward has past his first century, age-wise. The idea of a young inexperience girl falling in love with an old guy (and I mean old, 108 years old, to be precise) is kind of repulsive. Even more repulsive when thinking this is a book intended for teens. Yet, Meyer makes the situation “acceptable” by making Edward a virgin. Still, he may look good and seem mentally okay, but. . . No one gets to be 108 years old without ever having sex (because good vampires don’t have sex before marriage) without something being seriously wrong with them (which Meyer is eager to lets us know that it doesn’t matter, because the only thing that matters is that he’s still a virgin).More troublesome, at least for me, is the fact that while Edward is all nice, one of the other vampires in his group (who was once a lovely girl seduced by an old guy with whom she had sex before marriage) is always angry and full of hate. It doesn’t matter that now she has a loving “husband” and a family. Oh no, she’s full of terrible regret and loathe for herself. It's hard no to see the link between having kept yourself “pure” and the ability of being “happy.” The saddest part, I think, is that angry vampiresa was pretty much raped, so, not waiting wasn’t even her choice (now you see why I’m eager to talk to my niece about this book?).Now let’s pass to some other also worrying topic that has little to do with what Meyer thinks is appropriate teenage behavior and life choices, and that is Meyer's take on non-European cultures. Vampires, all of them white and pretty, are cultured and refine, some of them even served in the French courts and are patron of the arts and sciences. Even those who are still brutal blood-drinking monsters, are well manner and educated. But werewolves, who are all Native Americans, run around half naked, enslaved to their lowest instincts, so brute they are they can't stop themselves from hurting those they love. In this first book the comparison is not so obvious as we see little of soon-to-be werewolf Jacob’s people, but the next books leave no doubt as to what Meyer thinks of them.Anyhow, Twilight marks the entrance of vampires into main stream teen-romance and it was a widely successful book (this one and Harry Potter have been credited to have pushed the publishing industry out of a huge slump). I can see why this book did so well: the clichés, the idea of eternal love and undying beauty, the yes-but-better-no romance are things that will fascinate most teens (and a few adults). And nonetheless, the need remains to talk to the teens reading this book to discuss about all those not-so-hidden and very toxic messages.",88,0.9377,0.128,0.73,0.142,0.5556907308377896,NEGATIVE,0.8075
68,5290590,08/29/2007,2.0,"It was entertaining, I guess. But I've never had much of an interest in romance books, or vampires, so you see my dilemma. But what I really don't enjoy are novels that are pure fluff. And that's what Twilight is - just a mildly entertaining story with enough borderline-makeout scenes and impossibly attractive characters to keep the most Myspace-addicted fourteen year old girl amused. If this book encourages the above mentioned girls to read more, great. But for the rest of us, Meyer's novel doesn't have a whole lot to offer. There seemed to be a lot of pointless scenes (the vampire family playing baseball in the woods? Are you kidding me?),and the ending was annoying. It was as if Stephanie Meyer realized that she would eventually have to end the Edward-Bella Romantic Tension Montage, and so she quickly and improbably introduced an antagonist for an ending that felt hasty and tacked-on.What I'm about to write next will, I know, count as nothing less than pure blasphemy to dedicated Twilight fans, but here it is: I didn't like Edward.Take a moment to collect yourselves, and I'll explain.I didn't understand why he liked Bella so much (or for that matter, why every single boy in her high school falls in love with her almost instantly), and sometimes in the scenes between him and Bella, he struck me as very patronizing and controlling. He had a need to constantly remind Bella that he could snap her like a twig if he wanted, and then went on to tell her that he would take care of her, and that he knew what was best for her. There was no balance in Edward and Bella's relationship - he held the power, and he made all the decisions. The scene at the very end, where he basically forces her to attend Prom depsite her objections, was especially unsettling to me. ",89,0.9764,0.057,0.809,0.135,0.4709672619047619,NEGATIVE,1.0

Second, there was a part of him-and I didn’t know how potent that part might be-that thirsted for my blood.

YES YOU ARE A SICK MASOCHISTIC LION LIGHT BULB.AND THEN WE HAVE THE BASEBALL GAME, WHERE ANOTHER VAMPIRE LOVES THE SMELL OF HER BLOOD. HOW MANY PEOPLE LIKE HER? OH WAIT I FORGOT ‘SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS’. SHE’S SPESHUL. HE BLOOD ATTRACTS SPARKLING VAMPIRES. AND THEN BECAUSE OF SO CALLED ‘RELATIONSHIP WITH EDWARD SHE CUT ALL OF HERE FRIENDS AND HER DAD OUT OF HER LIFE ALL FOR A BOY WHO WANTS TO KILL HER?!!!!!??!?!?

AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT SHE HAS AS MUCH PERSONALITY AND EMOTION AS THE DUST UNDER MY BED. 
Mr Light Bulb:
I don’t think anyone realised that LIGHT BULB IS A STALKER. THAT IS BAD BEHAVIOUR WATCHING SOMEONE SLEEP. STALKERISH!!! Also how THE HELL did MISS DUMB still look attractive while she was still asleep?! Because if a boy *shudders* watching me sleep I would make them run away by my appearance. 
Bella x Edward::
WHERE WAS THE CHEMISTRY?! IT WAS AS EXISTENT AS MISS DUMBS COMMON SENSEThis is the time to say that Miss Dumb and Light Bulbs relationship was extremely toxic, please don’t romanticize something that would affect someones mental health in real life, thank you!
Mr Fuzz balls::
This was the only character that I liked in the first 3 books because He didn't want to kill Miss DumbHe didn't want to suck Miss Dumbs bloodHe was WARM and not as ‘cold as marble’ He is actually attractive unlike Light Bulb He was niceHe wasn't controllingHE DIDN’T SPY ON HER WHILE SHE SLEPTHe is niceHe was relatable So overall he was WAY BETTER than Light Bulb…..And THENNNNNN in the fourth book we find out the only reason he was attracted to Miss Dumb was because she had one egg inside of her that would produce his mate?! How FUCKED UP IS THAT??!First Miss Dumb and Light Bulbs age gap and now Fuzz Balls and Miss Dumbs egg age gap?!? Oh for FUCKS SAKE I AM DONE WITH THIS ILLEGAL SHIT. *takes another deep breath*

70,1397363755,09/21/2015,3.0,"For years I didn't even think of ever reading this book, that's how convinced I was of how this must be the worst novel anyone has ever written on this planet. Until four days ago I had marked it on Goodreads on my ""to go a long way round it"" shelf. And now that I have finally read it as a result of some weird mood I must have been in ... I can confirm that it isn't quite as bad as a lot of people proclaim it to be. Sure, a lot of things can be found in this book which are simply wrong; it is full of plot holes and inconsistencies, but it is addictive and keeps you hooked if you are in the mood for a fast-paced story to which it is easy to get attached. I was so convinced I would read Twilight only so that I could hate it and tear it apart in a one-star review that I didn't expect of how it would actually surprise me. That it would be entertaining. Gripping. That I would not have to force myself to reading it, but rather had to force myself to put it down.""There are a few flaws with that story.""Bella Swan might have talked about a different topic, but she definitely knew how to perfectly summarize the book Stephenie Meyer wrote about her. Yes, that book which teens have cried about, that book about sparkling vampires and teenie-weenie romance stuff. From a literary point of view, this book is pretty bad. It was easy to find moments in which you wanted to get into a serious conversation with Stephenie Meyer about whether she thinks that the way her characters behave is really okay. (I mean, watching someone sleep without them knowing - nobody can tell me that's normal.)Nevertheless, I will not spend any money on the cash cow Meyer turned her series into, yet I have to confess that Twilight made me feel like a lot of the hate surrounding this novel is directed towards 15-year-old fangirls screaming their mind to the heavens by the mere thought of Edward Cullen. Don't get me wrong, from an objective point of view, Twilight still deserves quite a huge number of 1-star ratings, and I would have been one of those people who hated it if I had expected to love it and be completely enthralled by a fascinating plot and heart-breaking romance. That was not the case, obviously. My first introduction to the series was back in eighth school class, when in our German classes each of us had to choose a book of our liking to present to the rest of the students. One girl chose to read from a passage of Twilight, a girl who fit perfectly into the definition of the term fangirl. I never understood the hype, and still can't see why exactly Edward Cullen is so well-beloved. Would he have turned into such a famous character if Robert Pattinson hadn't portrayed him in the movie adaption? (Which, by the way, made me appreciate the book even more because of the movie's awfulness.)To mention some more positive aspects about Twilight: It introduces teenagers to literature, and while it would of course be more appreciable if teenagers were reading the great classics, at least it is better than reading nothing at all. With reading being regarded more and more as something old-fashioned and obsolete among teenagers, this can never be seen as a bad thing. Before I discovered classics and literary fiction, YA fantasy has always been some kind of comfort zone, something you can identify with as a teenager. The question is, should teenagers even identify with characters like they are portrayed in Twilight? The shy and emotionally acting Bella; the super-attractive and hey-let's-watch-girls-while-they-are-sleeping Edward - it's questionable if they are indeed characters to look up to. It's also questionable if Stephenie Meyer is a great writer (I don't think so; at some points her writing made me cringe), but millions of fans will probably tend to disagree with me. Twilight is not for everyone and it has definitely divided its readers, but I have personally read books which were far worse than this.",86,0.9982,0.067,0.761,0.172,0.5872403613600795,NEGATIVE,0.9999

76,1454019337,11/28/2015,1.0,"So yesterday, my friend Aditi and I had this conversation about how some people think Twilight is better than Harry Potter. I did some research on this, and turns out that people actually are of this opinion. I don't usually compare books, but I did find this thread that I need to reply to; otherwise I will have no inner peace. I initially thought that these posts were ironic or sarcastic, because of the bad grammar and whatnot, but towards the end of it, there was evidence of research having been conducted in this regard, and hence my...childishness. Also, while I will be rebutting the points made on this thread with all the rage I can muster, this is my reply to anyone who has similar opinions which have been voiced on other websites. Leggo.I repeat, I did not start this. This isn't as much about liking Twilight or disliking it, as much as it is about refuting the points made in this article. 
REBUTTALS TO POINTS 1-10:
1. Robert Pattinson, can you say HOT? And he's totally sexy when he sparkles!And there, lies your first problem. To categorise a book as better than another merely because the main character is hot and he sparkles is a big mistake. Big. Huge. And seriously, how is the sparkly bit sexy? Vampires perish in sunlight, they do not sparkle. Besides, Edward Cullen lacks personality. Besides, Robert Pattinson was in Harry Potter first. He's also mentioned that he hates both the Twilight franchise and Edward Cullen. Weren't we supposed to be talking books here?2. Taylor Lautner, I mean, have you SEEN those muscles?Why does everything have to be about the physical attractiveness of the actors? But okay, I'll play. Tom Felton, I mean, have you seen him? And Matthew Lewis, who played Neville Longbottom was responsible for the term 'Longbottomed'! Have you seen those muscles?3. Kristen Stewart. An extremely talented and beautiful actress, with loads of potential.If this is a pattern, seeing as how Harry Potter definitely has more actors than Twilight, I could start listing every actor and his/her traits. But anyway, Emma Watson. Not only is she a talented and beautiful actress, she's smart, a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, and a proud feminist.4. The Volturi. REALISTIC villains, instead of insane freaks in cloaks, like Voldemort and the Death Eaters.How is a bunch of ""royal"", aged vampires who do absolutely nothing over the course of four books more realistic than Lord Voldemort, who became who he was because of his tragic parenthood, and the resulting...childhood? His features and magical powers may not be realistic, but as a character, he is a lot more real than the Volturi. Almost all of the 6th installment is dedicated to Voldemort's backstory! Also, Death Eaters are real people who were either too scared, too judgmental, or plain power hungry to not have sided with Voldemort.5. Because its just common sence to like twilight!!! Haha. Romance means everything. Bella and Edward are like, MENT 4 each other, and everything is just......PERFECT!! In Harry potter, u would that that harry and harmonie would like...fall in love or something....and then u watch people die in freaky ways, and then there are creepy things....GAHH!!! but yea. (:First of all, the spelling and grammar here are giving me a headache. More importantly, how naive are you to think that romance is everything?! In the immortal words of Hermione Granger, 
""there are more important things - friendship and bravery...""
 There are elements of romance in Harry Potter, but that is not the focus of it! It's about believing in yourself, about trusting others, and about the transcendental nature of love; not romantic love, but love in general. But if romance is what you're taking away from Harry Potter, you're reading it wrong. And seriously, Bella just has Stockholm Syndrome. She's a doormat that falls for a control freak; she hates making her own decisions and he enjoys making all their decisions. Besides, Harry and Hermione (note the correct spelling) share a platonic, almost sibling-like love. Hermione falls in love with Ron, and this happens over a period of time - it grows from friendship. This friendship makes their love that much stronger. Love at first sight is not a real thing! The deaths aren't freaky, they're heart-breaking. They also teach you that sometimes, bad things happen to good people, because it's the circle of life.6. Because it's one of the greatest love stories ever!! Harry Potter is good too, but Twilight has way more romance and more hot guys....EDWARD, JASPER, EMMETT, CARLISLE!! Need I say more!I see a pattern here. But because I've already started, listen up. It is not one of the greatest love stories ever. Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest love stories ever. Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Gone With the Wind, even Romeo and Juliet, which is a story I despise, are amongst the greatest love stories ever written. Twilight wouldn't hold a candle to even the worst adaptations of these stories. Harry Potter, I mention again is not a love story. It doesn't want to be one; it doesn't pretend to be one. And seriously, 'nuff with the hawt guys. There's more to life than looks. Need I say more? Besides, as Janhavi mentioned in one of the comments, Rowling created one of the most beautiful love stories with just one word. ""Always"". The sentiment behind this one word is greater and more tragically beautiful than anything Twilight has ever spewed. 7. Yes, we all know that Harry Potter and Twilight are both fiction, but Twilight is clearly better. When I read a book, I like to imagine myself in the plot or relate to the story somewhat. Aside from the vampire theme, Twilight actually takes place in a REAL town with up to date things. ex) cars, school, etc. I'm sorry but I just can't picture myself on a flying train, eating chocolate covered frogs, headed to a non existent magical school. In my opinion, Twilight is obviously better.In my opinion, Twilight is a million leagues below Harry Potter. How do you relate to a plot that contains...*inhales*a teenage girl falling in love with a 108 year old vampire who is, in fact not even a real vampire, because he a) sparkles, b) drinks only animal blood, and c) gets a girl pregnant; has a paedophile shapeshifter werewolf as a friend; gets married at the ripe young age of 17; has a demon-hybrid child that said werewolf friend who was previously in love with the girl falls in love with; partakes in the zombie apocalypse, except in this case it's the vampire apocalypse?!!!*exhales* Whew. If this is realistic, then sweetheart, you're on drugs. I'm not saying a school of magic is realistic; far from it (also, note that there is neither a flying train, nor chocolate covered frogs in Harry Potter). However, Harry Potter deals with themes that are much more realistic, like, I repeat, love, friendship, bravery, misunderstanding, and even war. A story where a boy was ready to sacrifice himself to save everyone he loved is not only more realistic, but also more endearing than a story about a vampire and a human falling in love. 8. OMGGG Harry POtter is messed up. Like seriusly, he needs to grow up and stop being so boring cuz edward is like waaaaaaay more AMAZINNNG. therees no love in hary potter and nobodies hot who wants to read a book without hot peeps?I'm sorry, but are you telling me Bella grows up and becomes interesting? No. Her thought process is exclusively, ""Edward pls. fuck me"" and ""Everyone else is a fucking plebe"". Harry, on the other hand grows immensely in the span of the seven books, he becomes more mature and understanding. And he is infinitely more interesting. Besides, how did Edward show any growth during the course of the book? In fact, I don't think he's shown any emotional maturity since his untimely death over a century ago. There is more love in Harry Potter than in Twilight. Edward and Bella's lust for each other doesn't count as love. There's all kinds of love in Harry Potter. Seriously, love is one of the central themes of the book. Maternal love, specifically, because it is the most powerful kind of love. There is also love between friends, love expressed as fanaticism, love within families, alongwith your requisite romantic love. Again, at the cost of repeating, being 'hot' isn't the most important thing in life. People in general read books without hot characters, because we're not shallow.9. Each book in the twilight series has a different story line. It is mainly about Bella's Lovestory but in the 1st book it was about how Edward had to save Bella and in each book the story changes. The main reason of the book is for Bella To become A vampire. Then after that it is the story with Renesmee. In Harry Potter it takes 7 or 8 books to get to the point. Killing the one who must not be named. it drags on and on and becomes boring.This is pure and utter bullshit. There is literally only one point to the Twilight books - Bella wants to get laid. Renesmee is the product of said laying, so your point becomes redundant. Besides, she comes for about the latter half of the last book, which isn't really much print space, if you ask me. It isn't mainly about Bella's love story, it is solely about Bella's love story. Harry Potter may, at its centre be about defeating the Dark Lord, but there is a steady build to the story; it gets progressively darker and more intricate, and by extension, more interesting. Initially, the scar is just a scar, but towards the end, it becomes so much more. Besides, Rowling's attention to detail and subtleties ensures that nothing you read is ever irrelevant. It is beautifully clever10. Twilight has a more reasonable plot than HarryPotter. Look at Harry and you'll see he's more angsty than Bella. And all the Harry Potter books are like Harry being ""My life sucks"" and then Voldemort shows up and he's like ""I'm going to kill you"" and Harry's all like ""No way"" and then Harry wins in the end. It's way obvious, especially when the author already tells you how many books there's going to be. I mean, why can't we live in total suspense on what's going to happen next? Twilight gives that suspense that something amazing is going to happen that Harry Potter never gave us. Plus, Harry Potter is a wizard and wizards are demonic creatures. Who would want to root for a demon as the good guys? In twilight, everyone's a vampire, and vampires aren't Satan's spawn.I'm sorry, am I reading that right? And so, I ask again. How? Where? Twilight has no plot! Unless, of course, you consider insatiable lust as ""plot"". And how is Harry more angsty than Bella?! Case in point, Bella tries killing herself and goes into a catatonic state when Edward leaves her. Now, Harry is dramatic, as in he likes throwing and breaking things, but he isn't any more angst-filled than any other boy his age. Harry never says his life sucks - he is unhappy with his life at the Dursleys because they treat him little better than a keep. Besides, even after having everything she wanted, Bella thinks her life sucks because she's in a place where it rains, and because everyone thinks she's so hot, and the one boy she wants isn't paying any attention to her. The whole Voldemort/Harry relationship is so much more complicated than ""Harry being ""My life sucks"" and then Voldemort shows up and he's like ""I'm going to kill you"" and Harry's all like ""No way"" and then Harry wins in the end"". Harry literally sacrifices himself before ""winning"", as you put it! There's plot for you. And trust me, as someone who's read the books more than a dozen times each, I can tell you it was very suspenseful. You never saw so many things coming! Just because she said there were going to be seven books doesn't mean she spoiled the ending. Nobody could've guessed the events that transpired in the last few books by having read the first book. Besides, are you telling me that Twilight wasn't predictable? I think everyone knew from line one of the blurb that by the end of it, Bella was going to get some bang-bang-bangitty-bang. There is zero suspense, yo! Also, the whole wizards are demonic creatures thing is just baloney.

79,315974527,04/20/2012,1.0,"Reviewing Twilight after reading War & Peace is definitely not the best thing.By the time I’m posting this review most of the people have already read it and those who have not, perhaps never will.After reading gazillion book-bashing reviews of Twilight there is no part of book left for me to bash upon (I see prospect for my bashing review in Fifty Shades of Grey)and perhaps nothing to add what all the reviewers have already said.I’m writing this because it’s been sometime that I’ve written a review and I have nothing else to write about. So, where to begin...First of all, two thingsTwilight isn’t bad! *Please, don’t unfriend me*And Twilight isn’t good either! *Now, we’re even. Eh?* For first point:Well, Twilight turned out not to be that bad as I was expecting it. After I didn’t enjoyed The Hunger Games, one thing that I learned is to keep my expectations really low to enjoy YA-novels. This wasn’t a hard job after reading umpteen 1-star reviews.Also one of the main reasons behind reading it was, I wanted to see how bad, really how bad a book can get.So I had my expectations really low, I was thinking it would be book to which giving even 1-star would be like inflating its rating. But once I started reading (keep in mind that I’ve not watched any movie in the series, just few random scenes), I was caught not-so-ready for the good parts of the novel that made me to give it 2-star rating.To start with I liked the characterisation of the main characters Bella and Edward, they certainly felt like real human, which is in my view very unusual for a YA-novel. Many people just hate this novel because they think Bella is a loser, well, she certainly can’t be source of any inspiration but it is not necessary that for a novel to be good that its protagonist should be kick-ass or bad-ass or something in the line of ass. Then Stephenie Meyer very cleverly chooses Forks as the setting of the novel, which assists the further things that she comes up in the novel.Then she shows her creativity by giving new aspects to age-old existing norms of vampire by telling they sparkle in sunlight, though it’s funny but nevertheless it’s creativity.And yes, the writing, I have heard a lot about Stephenie Meyer’s bad writing but for me it was kind of okay. Initially it was interesting too but then...But then Shit happened... Everything was fucked up, Bella was fucked up, Edward was fucked up, Stephenie Meyer’s writing was fucked up and the whole story was fucked up.All so good Bella started stumbling, would just fall down every now and then. “Are you referring to the fact that you can’t walk across a flat stable without finding something to trip over!”“Obviously”  I think Stephenie Meyer would have read somewhere that every human has some shortcoming and fault in their human aspect, so she came up with this shit, BELLA STUMBLES! For no reason she would just trip over nothing. What image should I have of Bella in my mind, in movie Bella looks like this:Beauty, isn't she!But after all those stumbling and falling down in every nook and corner of Forks, I think of her as something like this:Okay okay okay! I know that was way over the top but definitely something like this:See, she even seems to be telling “I was supposed to play Bella until that bitch came and took both movie and Robert Pattison.”No wonder characterisation is great, but not good since she takes 300 pages for this small task. In 90% of the book she talks about nothing but Bella and Edward. Bella talks about every body part visible of Edward: his topaz eyes, his nose, his hair, his teeth, his chest, his breath. She just knows that he is like some greek God and nothing beyond that, and so loves him. OMFG! This is what many people call the best love story ever.And Edward, umm.... He is the most beautiful, a vampire, he sparkles, he is 108 year old so definitely a paedophile and yes a stalker. Stalking may look all cute and loving in an immature story but in reality it is really not cool, who goes sneaking into his girlfriend’s room to watch her sleeping. That’s friggin’ weird and creepy.Oh! And he chuckles too, like Bella who keeps falling for no reason this Edward the 108 years old, keeps chuckling all the time, for no reason. I read a line today that said: “Never trust people who smile constantly.They’re either selling something or they are not very bright” For Edward, I don’t know... And finally the story, actually Stephenie Meyer must have writing continuously for 300 pages how Bella and Edward love each other and how handsome Edward is, then suddenly she must have realised something is missing in the whole book: Oh yes! The story. So she came up with this GREAT STORY. They play baseball in thunderstorm (really?) and other vampire come to join them after hearing the sound of hitting (really?) and one of them(James) become obsessed with tracking and killing Bella, but in the end James dies. End of the story. Thank you!Oh fuck it! Who am I kidding! 1-star.",74,0.9974,0.112,0.7,0.188,0.5276148368539674,NEGATIVE,1.0

“Death is Peaceful, Life is Harder” 
I MISS this book. I MISS those days when I was young and love is someting beyond the realm of understanding for my age. Twilight is my first romance book, it also introduced me to many new things, especially Edward and Bella's true love. She's an ordinary girl but her world is turned upside down when Edward walks into her life. THAT SCENE ! That scene when they first meet, my brain was scattered and my heart was beating so fast I couldn't breath, it's perfect I almost cried over it.
“You are my life now.”
 This is not a good book, though. Twilight is NOT for everyone. Bella is quite annoying. Edward is too perfect. BUT this book is my youth, my first love and my memory. I cherish it like this is my second heart. Twilight gave me something that changed my life then.

No. Unfortunately, there are too many awful books out there to count.Now, while it wasn’t trash, it was the epitome problematic and toxic. There was only one character with common sense in this book, which was kind of sad because common sense is called common sense for a reason.I lowkey don’t want to analyze our delightful characters, but there’s no way around it.First off, we have Isabella Swan, who sadly happens to be our main character. She likes to be called Bella, and oh she prefers a driving rusty noisy truck to a shiny volvo because it’s quirky. I think she’s missing a brain, but of course we need a damsel in distress so that a hot vampire can come and save her. I cannot count the number of times “unordinary” or “special” is used to describe her, mostly by *cough cough* Edward. We get it. She’s Different™Edward Cullen is a creepy stalker who happens to be wherever Bella is all the time so that he can protect her and ‘keep her out of trouble.’ He follows her home every night, which is, y’know, totally normal. He is described many times as a “godlike creature” which is strange because to me he seems like a weird and crusty old man. He’s also a possessive and controlling pain in the ass. Idk what Bella finds so appealing in him but I guess that’s just the way things go.Charlie was stupid and annoying. He was lazy, watched tv and baseball, went to work all day but was he really working, and didn’t even cook for himself. He expected Bella to make dinner for him and for her to do all the housework and cleaning while he was “working,” which I find extremely sexist. I don’t know what else to say, except, I’d be fine if he were dead.Carlisle and Esme are fine enough. They don’t have much personality besides being kind and welcoming to Bella (which is stupid) and turning people into vampires after they’re almost dead?? But Esme seemed nice so I can’t really have anything against her and Carlisle is basically a super young model doctor or something.Alice Cullen had a very interesting gift. She can see the future, which honestly I wouldn’t want to do because that would be kind of scary. Her power is weird though because she can only see the future after someone’s made a decision which is kind of pointless. She’s also constantly described as pixie-like, which got tedious after a while but I guess it's important??Emmett Cullen kills bears and is apparently very strong which is cool. At least he’s not Edward. And he’s surprised when Bella actually says something smart (once, in a 500+ page book) which I appreciate. But then he becomes friends with Bella just like Alice and suddenly he’s lacking some braincells too.Jasper Hale may have a brain, that is to be determined for now. He’s the only one who’s somewhat friendly to Bella but not exactly friends with her. I don’t know what to think, though, because in Adela’s review of Twilight she mentioned that he was part of the Confederate Army. Which means he could have been racist, in which case I hate him. So I kind of need confirmation or denial.Rosalie Hale was - surprise - the ONLY one with common sense in this book! Yay! She hated Bella, which I completely understand because Bella is very unlikable. She was also basically a supermodel which was amazing. She doesn’t care about some stupid needy hUmAn and she doesn’t need to waste her time helping them either.On the topic of common sense, Edward has a thirst for Bella’s blood but she’s still obsessed with him which is highly inadvisable but when does Bella ever do anything that’s advisable in the least?Edward and Bella were possibly the most toxic romance I’ve ever read about. We start out with a cringey instalove situation, which normally I can tolerate, just barely, but it gets worse, don’t worry. Then, Edward swoops in on like three occasions in just the first 200 or so pages and saves Bella from almost dying. One time she almost got run over by a truck but Edward just happened to be there to save her.Oh wait, it gets even worse. Bella, Jessica, and Angela (idk what happened to Lauren. Or maybe she didn’t come and I totally imagined that line, I don’t know anymore, guys.) go on a girl’s night to pick out prom dresses a few hours away from Forks, which is the dreary and rainy town they live in. And oh no, Bella gets cornered into a dark alley by some guys!! But we don’t have to worry anymore, because Edward is there too!! He followed them!! In his car!! And he saves her again!! Yay!!It would’ve been easier if she’d just died there, but no.So then we have these cheesy, melodramatic lines that are dropped throughout the book. Here are some lovely examples: “It’s been almost a century that Edward’s been alone. Now he’s found you.”
Ah, yes. A creepy old stalker following an idiotic whiny girl home. The absolute perfect pairing. “His face startled me - his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful…” I...Edward can’t even let you go to class without looking pained because you have to leave for an hour?? But wait. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, it did. They were at Bella’s house, and then Edward admits to having followed her home every single night and watching her sleep.You read that correctly. She was surprised, but then she found it attractive. And not only attractive, but romantic. *aggressively throws up* And we’re still not done. Edward is a possessive, condescending, creepy stalker. Here are some more beautiful, beautiful quotes. “Don’t be difficult, Bella.” 
Oh my god she’s seventeen and even though she’s helpless, she’s not a baby.
“No, I’ll mostly be watching you.” 
...Excuse me? They’re watching a movie, and instead Edward wants to watch Bella because he thinks the movie is boring anyways.
""He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless.""
1) Bella is unhealthily obsessed with Edward.2) With his Special ~Golden Eyes~ and ~Crooked Smile~, Bella is always breathless. I'm surprised she's even alive at this point. “I think your friends are angry at me for stealing you.”“They’ll survive.” I could feel their stares boring into my back.“I may not give you back, though,” he said with a wicked glint in his eyes.I gulped.
That whole conversation was so problematic, I don’t even know where to start.Kill me now :DThere was one thing that Twilight did well, though, and that was pure entertainment. The 
plot
 was well-paced and balanced out drama and action. Never once was I bored. While I couldn’t connect to the characters at all, it was definitely entertaining.I know that I clearly expressed my dislike for this book throughout this review, but let me be clear that I, by no means, think it is an absolute dumpster fire. I think we need to put it in perspective.To prove my stupidity, I will be reading the rest of the series, or at least New Moon.

92,7944360,10/19/2007,2.0,"The problem I have with Twilight is that while my inner fangirl loves this book my outer author (though amateur) knows how poor a book this is. But Twilight is a romance meant for teenage girls longing for a romantic escape, realism would only detract from the magic of Forks and the Cullens, if you want to enjoy this book then you must embrace that inner fangirl and let go of your outer author. I only wish that Mrs. Meyer had put more effort into at least making the characters more real. Questions such as why the Cullens returned to Forks arise or why they are attending high school again (according to an FAQ it is to stay current with new discoveries but surely such a small town is not ideal for knowledge), I like to pretend that the Cullens returned to Forks for Alice and Jasper's sake so they could be at the beginning of the vampires' enemies as well as learn to be human in a small town before moving on to bigger things- alas, such reasoning is not used and we must accept this reality without explanation, which even my inner fangirl cannot accept.The romance- some love it, some complain how unrealistic and stupid it is. Well, it is Bella's first love, despite all the male attention she didn't care. Edward has read the minds of everyone around him for 90 years, immediately labeling someone and (most likely) not giving them a chance beyond politeness, then comes along a girl whose mind he can't read and whose blood drives him to the edge of insanity; when he learns more about Bella he sees a, mature girl who shares similar hobbies, and enjoys old fashioned things (like himself). Alas, what I have pointed out (actually based on someone else's review) is not remarked upon in the book; we are to accept that they love each other and that is all- no questions, their love transcends time and they shall die for the other and blah, blah, blah. If only Meyer had Bella and Edward explain their attraction to each other, then this book would be more liked.The main character is either called smart or stupid. Bella does display positive traits: unlike the sequels she is selfless enough to get her friends together and move to Forks so her mother can be happy with her boyfriend, Bella is also intelligent enough to be placed in an advanced program, she displays a sarcastic wit which eventually turns into decent humor rather than complaining, she reads the classics like Austen, listens to Debussy and other music quite often, and most importantly, is very observant- she notices the Cullens vampire speed speaking to each other, how they don't eat their food, how Edward's eye color changes, their abnormal camping season, and how beautifully alike they all are. On the bad side: Bella is not wise enough to think that as a danger prone, clumsy, bad luck magnet that she may be in danger at night, alone, in an unfamiliar city. Her intelligence is arguable when she is in Edward's presence since she either is too consumed by first love to think clearly or she is perhaps, so stupid and selfish she doesn't care (which becomes apparent in the sequels). A neutral trait is Bella's clumsiness- a common Moe Moe trait- which is actually rather cute given that it is random and not serious (unlike the sequels) but her clumsiness is questionable in it's realism- though thankfully, her clumsiness didn't set in motion events (unlike the sequels which only happened because of an ACCIDENT than her clumsiness). Her issue with blood is my biggest gripe, I know real people are hemophobes (fear of blood) but it just seems out of place with Bella, of all her traits, this one feels the most tacked on, existing only for irony.The biggest flaw is not even of her character but of her appearance. If you read Meyer's FAQ you will see just how similar Bella is to Stephenie only her appearance reminds me of a cute anime girl- the clumsy Moe Moe. Bella's name is even worse: Isabella Marie Swan- Beautiful Swan- gee, that's subtle. I cannot fathom how Eric, Mike, Tyler, and Jacob all came to pursue Bella- Eric is desperate, Mike is popular so he doesn't make sense, Tyler only wants to make up nearly killing Bella, and Jacob falls in love with Bella with nothing more than the knowledge that this girl used to hang out with his older sisters. Then of course is Lauren- the most popular girl in school- who becomes jealous of Bella for the rest of high school for having so much attention and not wanting it.Bella reminds me of Fujioka Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club, only Haruhi is cool and special, I can understand why four guys and a girl love her and why a mean girl is envious. Only Bella chooses to fight because she knows she will trip if she tries to run while Haruhi will choose to fight to protect girls from jerks.Edward's appeal comes largely from the fact that no man (or woman) can be THAT romantically perfect. My fangirl coos at Edward's suave, flirtatious, and mysterious nature (also because he wears a turtleneck) while my author longs for a more solid character. All of Edward's charming characteristics stem from his experience as a vampire rather than the son of a wealthy lawyer in Chicago who dreamed of fighting in the war- but either 90 years of mind reading and some of killing bad people leads to a questionable conclusion, I just don't feel that Edward's past is part of the vampire Bella meets. Also, his angst- laughably dumb. Sorry Ed, but I just don't care, perhaps it is Edward's nature to try and help others but his past escapades of murder and heroics are forgotten after they are mention and are not recalled in the sequels.The writing was simple and had a nice magical ring to it, it brought a real sense of the misty, green atmosphere behind Bella's house and the sunny yellow meadow of Edward's.A big problem I have with Twilight is how we must exit Bella's head to analyze characters. Bella's self esteem seems fine in the beginning given how she doesn't care for the male attention nor cares for Lauren's envy but as she falls in love with Edward he is seen through her ""first love and with the perfect guy"" eyes and Edward as a person is lost to Bella considering him perfect. Luckily, we only encounter a few of her self-depreciating comments- only when she is caught by surprise by Edward's vampiric beauty (and for the first time). But I do not enjoy having to analyze these characters through the eyes of a girl who can see nothing but absolute perfection. Bella is supposed to be observant and yet cannot pick out characteristics like how much Edward questions her since he can't read her mind and especially not what someone would be like after 90 years of immediately labeling someone by reading their thoughts.As an author and reader, I roll my eyes at Meyer's biggest mistake- whereas my fangirl was excited and happy with the random encounter of James' coven, I still know how desperate Meyer must have been for an exciting conclusion and so tossed this in. Albeit, fangirls will enjoy the cat-and-mouse game at the end (as well as the character development of Alice and most definitely Jasper) but critics will scoff at the sudden appearance to conclude what just was a mystery and romance driven plot where the only danger was Edward himself. The worst part of the encounter is how this completely random wind sets in motion the hunt, not even Bella's clumsiness (which may have improved the chase), but a wind.Meyer had plenty of opportunities to be the new Anne Rice (with actual literary credit rather than a strong fan following) and yet she fails to create strong supporting characters, secondary characters, world, vampire mythology, and overall a strong story. Her vampires have NO WEAKNESSES, rather than die in sunlight they sparkle, they even have super, special, awesome powers- some which effect Bella and some that don't, which goes unexplained for two books. While I am not a romance fan and have no interest in romance myself, I was still enchanted with Twilight. Alas dear reader, the magic shrivels up and dies in New Moon and Eclipse; trust me, stop here- maybe read New Moon since a lot happens plot and relationship wise, but DO NOT read Eclipse for even though important stuff does happen it is handled so poorly I can scarcely acknowledge it.",44,0.9993,0.133,0.664,0.203,0.5866169304284056,NEGATIVE,0.9961
93,3741645227,10/17/2021,1.0,"1 star (for the 1 brain cell that Bella has)DNF @ 13%✨What a bad excuse for something called a “book”.✨Why this is a shitty book - An essay, from someone who DNFed the book.Published in 2005, Twilight is a young adult book by Stephanie Meyer. For the lack of a better word, I describe this book as bad.The first issue with the book is the main character - Bella Swan. Bella Swan has no personality, no hobbies, and only one brain cell. Evidence; Bella describes everything robotically, Bella talks too much about things that should be ✨basic logic✨, Bella spends all her time thinking about Edward or going to school, and, Bella falls in love with the strangest person in her new town. “That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen”I would like to think “Is Bella okay?”, and try to help her. But I can’t, so leave me alone.The second issue with this book is the writing. Normally, I don’t pay too much attention to the writing in books style in books. Every author has their own writing style, and as long as it doesn’t distract from the story, and as long as it makes sense, I don’t care that much. However, the writing here was an abomination. Not only an abomination of general writing criteria but also, an abomination of the ✨ reader’s brain✨.“I slept seamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night before.” “Charlie called out goodbye, watching the dust motes stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window”I” decided to kill an hour with non-school related reading. I had a small collection of books that came with me to Forks”It’s hard to put my finger on it, but the writing is bland, indeed. It feels like it was written by a 7-year-old with good grammar skills. Also, the most irrelevant details are emphasized. Nobody cares about the ✨dust motes stirring in the sunlight✨ The third, and final, issue with the book is the general premise of the book Maybe this premise is just your thing, so don’t be offended. Okay?As someone who DNFed this book, I might be going out on a limb here. And, I might be using some *coughs* things I’ve heard from friends and *coughs* things I’ve heard from youtube videos. But this book is basically just about a very pointless person falling in love with a dumb vampire. And, ✨paranormal romance✨. So, maybe I am bringing a little too much personal opinion into this. Or, maybe the premise is just terrible. Who really cares anyway?The fourth, and final issue, is that this book is basically just a knock off of The Vampire DiariesIf you haven’t heard of The Vampire Diaries, it’s basically the equivalent of a proper guilty pleasure - something trashy that is still good enough to properly enjoy.  The Vampire Diaries has ✨actual good plot✨. It also has high school students, vampires, etc. same difference. So, maybe I am going a little bit insane here, and I am using too much *coughs* outside info. However, ✨we don’t talk about that✨.In conclusion, Twilight is a shitty book, with shitty characters, and a shitty plot. You are probably laughing at how ridiculous I seem right now. With my ✨essay✨ and ✨quotes✨ and ✨bad reasoning✨ and ✨sparkles✨. But I don’t care✨, I had fun writing this.~~~A little bit about this book, and people’s sexist attitude toward it - I hate this book - I hate it because it has bad writing, bad plot, and bad characters. However, some people seem to come for this book, not because of the actual issues with it, but because the majority of the fans of this book are teen girls. It seems that everything liked by teen girls is automatically deemed as “trashy” or “stupid”. And yes, things liked by teen girls can be deemed as “trashy” or “stupid”(anything can be deemed “trashy” or “stupid”), but deeming it that way cannot be justified by the fact that teen girls like it. Deeming anything bad because it is liked by teen girls is incredibly sexist, as you are basically saying that things liked by teen girls are bad. Sure, I hate this book, but I just genuinely don’t like it. It could be mainly liked by teen boys, that wouldn’t change my opinion of it.Your hate for something cannot be justified by sexist excuses.

94,3732771656,08/09/2021,4.0,"What nearly everyone is wondering? How in the world did I like this book? Well here come the answers!~3.5 Stars~Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, A lot which most people I know hate so much. I was sad so I read it. I was warned by my lovely friends not to read it. But as you can see I read it and somehow I didn’t hate it. Also this review is gonna have a lot of hate for Bella. Just warning Bella lovers out there! (If there are any👀)~The Plot~The book started with boring old Bella moving to live with her father in a town named Forks, so her mother could be happy. (Not because her mother didn’t want her.) Anyways in Forks she made friends with some people. She saw this guy named Edward and something about Edward intrigued her, but he was avoiding her. Until, she almost died when this guy almost banged his truck to her, and Edward saved her. Bella kept asking Edward things and he never seemed to answer properly. Later Bella remembered something her friend Jacob said and did some research. After that she asked Edward if he was a vampire, he was. (NOT A SPOILER, IT WAS SO OBVIOUS, LIKE SO OBVIOUS) Anyway they started dating (No surprise there at all). And some weird and maybe even creepy things happened. Looking at you Edward. (Who likes to look at someone sleep, CREEPY) Anyway after that one day Edward decided to take Bella to his house where when they were playing baseball this guy called James showed up and he wanted to eat Bella’s blood or something (I think that’s right) So all the Cullens wanted to protect Bella, they got like a safe house for her or something (Again I think that’s right), where Alice and Jasper guarded her. Anyway when Bella was supposed to meet Edward, she ran away from the airport so she could save her mom. Long story short it was a trap and James almost made Bella into a vampire. Later in the hospital Edward sucked all the venom from Bella so she could be human (AHHHHH, EDWARD WHYYYYY?, I COULD’VE HAVE RESTED IN PEACE, DIDN’T YOU WANT ME TO REST IN PEACE. . . Also that was so long, I know sorry)This is kinda my thoughts for the plot at times!~My thoughts on the plot~The plot was weirdly predictable. I knew Edward and all his was a vampire, I knew that at the end something kinda tragic would happen. Even I’m surprised I liked the plot. It was good I guess!, though I do think it could’ve been better cause I'm in the middle it got really boring. ~Writing~I actually liked the writing. It was good. I mean the writing did help me get through some of the book. (Idk if that made any sense) But I think it makes sense to me. I mean for a book a lot of people hated. The writing style wasn't bad. I was a little surprised about that. ~Characters~~Bella~I ABSOLUTELY HATE BELLA, WITH EVERYTHING, I WOULDN’T CARE IF SHE WENT TO HELL!, (That was extreme, but it’s true) I hate everything about her, and I know she’s literally narrating the book, so I have no idea how I got through the book and liked it. (Also I hate movie Bella more than book Bella) I hate Bella’s personality so much. It irritates me so much. I cannot stand it. I also think she’s so weak and she constantly makes everyone worry about her, and in the book it looks like she doesn’t want anyone to worry about her but I totally think she’s pesurfully doing it. I mean it’s not natural for someone to get hurt so much. Also what the heck is special about Bella, that a vampire falls in love with her. I don’t think there’s anything unique about her, other than Edward not being able to read her mind. I mean all I find unique about her is that she gets hurt too much, it’s annoying. I have never hated a character so much, like ever. Also she puts everyone around her in danger. I MEAN SERIOUSLY WHAT THE HECK IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT HER THAT EVERYONE WANTS HER. Also hate when she’s sad, not because I feel bad for her, (Cause I’ll probably never feel bad for her) but cause when she’s sad SHE MAKES EVERYTHING AROUND HER GLOOMY EVEN ME, I HATE IT, JUST BECAUSE YOUR SAD DON’T MAKE EVERYONE AROUND YOU SAD TOO!~Edward~Ok so I found out a lot of people don’t like Edward, and I guess I kinda get why but I personally liked Edward. He’s what kept me sane through the book when Bella was around. I like his personality, I guess, I mean I don’t like his personality as much as I’d love another character’s but still. I also imagine him looking handsome and cute! I also think that his reading minds thing is cool, I mean it’s not a new power but it’s cool for a vampire to have it! ~Alice~I like Alice. She seems so very nice! She is my favorite person from the Cullens family, other than Edward. I absolutely love her personality. She’s so sweet. I love that about her. She might just be one of my favorite characters! I also love her power to see the future, like I said before it’s not a new power it just seems cool on a vampire. ~Jesper~I think he’s cool, I also like his power too! He can manipulate emotions or something like that I think. I do also wish I’d seen him more in the book. He only really appeared after half of the book, which was sad cause I think if I knew more about him I’d really like him. Also his personality seems interesting in a good way, ~Rosalie~I only like Rosalie cause she doesn’t like Bella. That probably isn't a good enough reason to like her, but I don’t really care. Ok so other than Rosalie not liking Bella I don’t like her much. She just doesn’t seem to fit with me. I also weirdly imagine her as one of those cool mean girls. Who will later realise her personality mistakes, and apologise to Bella, but I don’t want that to happen. ALSO ROSALIE WHY THE HECK ARE YOU JEALOUS OF BELLA!, SHE’S NOTHING COMPARED TO ANYONE LIKE EVER. OUT OF ALL PEOPLE YOU HAD TO BE JEALOUS OF BELLA. Also there are more characters, but some of them aren’t really much in the book, and a few I have no idea what to say about them, like Emmett, Carlisle, Esme, etc. ~Ending~The ending was peaceful, it was kinda a happily ever after-ish ending. I mean with the ending you didn’t need anything much more!, but of course there’s more! Idk if that's good or bad. Hopefully good, but I have a bad feeling. (READ THE NEXT BOOK, BAD THING IT'S TERRIBLE WHY COULDN’T THIS BOOK WRAP UP EVERYTHING AHHH) ~Romance~I want to ship Edward & Bella, but I don’t think Bella’s right for him. I mean Bella’s everything someone would not want, and still Edward wants her, you're a good guy Edward. So in the end I don’t think I ship Edward & Bella. Also I totally think Jacob has a crush on Bella and I totally think in the next books Edward and Jacob are gonna have some fight sort of thing. (I know this for sure now, read the next book, New moon) And I wouldn’t ship Jacob and Bella if it happened. Again it’s all Bella’s fault. ~Overall~I didn’t hate this book, but it wasn’t something I really loved either. I’ll probably never ever read this again. If I do it’ll probably be because I’m sed and want to be mean to myself. Also if I do re-read it I'll hate it! Lastly, I don’t recommend you read this book even though I somehow weirdly liked it because I'm pretty sure you won’t really like it👀. Also now that I wrote this review I feel like I like this book less, but I don't like changing my rating because then i find it wrong after some time and I change it back.

96,124756362,10/04/2010,1.0,"Okay, the star rating is a lie. Twilight rox. But you know what does not rock and gets only one star? Real-life Twilight experiences. Twilight tells the basic creepy-old-man-stalks-young-girl story. You know the one. It’s everywhere. He woos her by being vaguely threatening and manipulative. She sees his condescension as the patient musings of a wiser soul. It’s fun in a book, but when you see it in real life, walk the other direction. In my experience, it is possible for creepy stalkers to come around almost anywhere, and the internet is no exception. I don’t want to get lecturey on you, but I think that, especially for people who are the typical targets of stalkers (all you Bellas out there), but really for everyone, it is important to be aware and smart and even suspicious. Don’t give your address to people you don’t know. And don’t think that a compliment is always what it seems. Sometimes compliments are manipulation. If someone makes you uncomfortable or seems suspicious, don’t be afraid to tell them that. Don’t feel pressured to keep yourself in an uncomfortable situation or to talk to people who skeeze you out. You don’t have to be afraid, just remove yourself from the situation. If a friend tells you to watch out for someone, give that advice a chance. I know it’s obvious to say, but I like being reminded every once in a while that you can’t control other people’s actions, but you can control your own.As an example, I’ll tell you a story of one time when I wasn’t smart and didn’t remove myself from a situation. This is a pretty specific situation, and it takes place in Ukraine, but I really think things like it could happen anywhere. So, my friend, Vanessa, lived in the middle of the country, and I was going to visit her. We met in Kyiv to take the bus back to her city. The bus we got on was old and rickety, and the only seat was right in the front. We were exhausted and Vanessa fell asleep against the window. The bus driver kept looking at us in the rear-view mirror, but I didn’t think anything of it because we were American and got stared at all the time. He must have been going about thirty miles an hour the entire way there, because I think we got in about two hours after we were supposed to. Vanessa told the driver, in Ukrainian, where to drop us off, but he drove right past the stop down to the regular station. We got out at the station and Vanessa was pissed. It was really late, and it would have been easy for them to let us off at her stop. She had just woken up, too. We had both been sleeping off and on.We got out of the bus to get our luggage, and as we were grumbling and trying to find our bags, the driver’s assistant came up to us and explained that they were actually going to let everyone off and drive us BACK to her stop. Oh! We slapped our foreheads. That makes so much more sense. We got back into the bus. (NEVER GET BACK INTO AN EMPTY BUS.) Duh. We were really tired, so that’s some excuse, but not much. Anyway, the driver’s assistant got behind the wheel, and took off in the opposite direction of the town. So, there we are, driving out in the middle of the country (but really the middle of nowhere because there aren’t even houses or lights or anything) with these two old, creepy Ukrainian guys. Vanessa was freaking out a little bit, and started gathering weapons around her. She had her keys out and some kind of antenna from the dashboard. I don’t remember what else, but that is exactly what you should do if you find yourself in a situation like that. Self-defense 101. The driver, now freed from his driving responsibilities, sat across from me and asked us the Ukrainian for “do you girls like to party?” We quickly answered “no.” He told us that he had a stash of vodka stored in the back of the bus for just such an occasion. He slid his hand over onto my leg. Vanessa immediately slapped it off. You could see the gears in our brains turning. What if we were murdered, there in the Ukrainian countryside, and just left out to rot? What if we escaped, but spent days wandering in circles in the empty fields and eventually died of thirst? Could we jump from a moving bus? Why did we get back on the fucking bus?Then, after about ten or fifteen minutes, they pulled up to a gas station – in the middle of friggin’ nowhere, mind you – got gas, and headed back to town. We were fine. We were shaken, and it wasn’t a safe situation, but we were fine. What I’m telling you is this: it’s not your fault if you are the victim of unwanted attention, but there are a lot of things you can do to be smart and safe. Take a self-defense class. Be honest with other people. Listen to your instincts. Block people on the internet if they are making you uncomfortable. Don’t harass people yourself, but if you’re uncomfortable, be smart. Learn from your mistakes.Twilight is fun. I’m the first to admit it. Fictional Edward is a boyfriend you could buy at Claire’s™. How much does that rock? But in real life Edward is just an old, bossy man with a thirst for blood. That’s not romantic. It’s gross. While awesome, fictional Edward got into Bella’s home through her window, gross, real-life Edwards get into our homes through our computers. (Not literally, although, oooo sci-fi fan-fic waiting to happen?) It recently came to my attention that a member of goodreads was accused on another website of using Goodreads(.com) and other places on the internets to harass people - basically he was accused of being a real-life Edward. (I expressly claim the content of that link, though I apologize for its graphic nature. Goodreads(.com) does not claim the content of that link. : this should in no way constitute legal advice to anyone, including Goodreads(.com) or affiliated agencies, but according to §§10, 12, and 14 of my and the accused member's contract with Goodreads(.com), as well as U.S. federal law, 47 U.S.C. sec. 230(c)(1), and U.K. law, Defamation Act of 1996 §1(3), Goodreads(.com) is only a content provider, not a publisher of my statements, and has no liability for what I say on here.  Although Goodreads(.com) may not be convinced that any users of its service are creepy, I am persuaded. We are separate. Please don’t blame it for what I say. I have talked to both parties involved in the incident. Below are the accused’s responses to me. The girl who originally posted the accusations has asked that we not contact her, as all of the harassment she has received from questions about that post has been just about as awful as the original harassment. I hope you will respect those wishes. I would be glad to answer any questions I can about this either in the thread below or in a private message. You might not think that the accusations are true, and that is entirely valid. I did the investigation I needed to do in order to confirm for myself that the accused member of Goodreads is creepy, you can do what you need, or ignore the situation entirely, as you like. I understand the importance in a trial of presuming someone innocent until proven guilty, but I do not believe that I need to wait to have an opinion about someone until that person has gone through a trial. I can have an opinion based on whatever standard of evidence I like, and the testimony of a witness, combined with my own experience, and countered by nothing, is enough evidence to persuade me. Also, I am willing to err on the side of caution where the potential for harm is either exposing Bellas to stalking and harassment, or exposing an innocent man to loss of business. Both are horrible, but the former is more horrible to me. Again, everyone should balance that for themselves. Honestly, beyond blocking him myself, I'm not very interested in this particular person, as I don't think he's at all unique. He serves as a symbol in this review, yes, but a symbol of something much larger and more ubiquitous. If someone STARTS harassing the accused member because of the things I wrote here or for whatever reason, I will think that harassment is as stupid as any other harassment.The community manager of Goodreads(.com) has informed me that the appropriate way to deal with a potential predator on Goodreads is to inform the community manager of where the offensive posts exist, and he will delete them. That seems to me like just about the worst way possible to deal with situations like this. Not only does it cover up for the offender by erasing evidence, it also makes it difficult to warn people in the future of patterns. I think the stupidest (bless their ‘lil hearts) way to deal with stalking is to pretend you can stop it by erasing it. I have already blocked the accused member because I don’t want him to access my friends through my profile, but I think censoring his account or his comments is a ludicrous way of “dealing” with a situation. Also, I frankly think that crazy people have the right to read books and talk about them, too. Just because I don’t want to be friends with the accused member, doesn’t mean other people, who are not in danger of being targeted by him, shouldn’t. Plus, deleting his account or comments doesn’t accomplish anything, as he can make a new profile, or write new comments. The point is that we should all be careful (especially the Bellas). Again, trust your instincts and learn from your mistakes. If you have bad instincts, trust your friends. Do the opposite of what Bella does because Edward, in real life, is the opposite of what Edward is in fiction.I’m a big fan of the Take Back the Night movement, but I don’t think the night is the only thing that shouldn’t be dominated by fear. So this is your call to take back the internet. When goodreads originally took down this review and the others like it, I had invited people to copy my review and write about their own experiences with real-life Edwards. I invite you to do that again if you would like. You are definitely responsible for whatever you copy or change from this review, but you are welcome to it. The world is there for all of us to enjoy, for men and women. Parents shouldn’t be afraid to let their kids use the internet. We are real people on here and should treat each other as such. Don’t let people gain power through fear. ______________________________________POSTS from me to the accused Goodreads(.com) membermessage 10: Sep 26, 2010 09:14amPeople around here seem to be very concerned, and with good reason, about this: http://morbidprose.livejournal.com/24399...Do you have a response to these accusations? More specifically, have you given attention to other people that they have perceived as unwanted or offensive, or have you threatened people? I'm also specifically interested to hear what you have to say about the accusation of racism.For myself, I'm not very concerned about being friends because if you harass me, I can always block you. I don't want my posts to expose other friends of mine to that kind of harassment, though. If you don't respond to this with some kind of reasonable explanation, or if you delete this post, I will probably block you. I would rather not block anyone, but I don't want people I care about to feel uncomfortable posting on my threads. I look forward to your response. message 11: Sep 28, 2010 07:54amI had hoped you would be upfront about answering the livejournal accusations because it seems both childish and overly formal to need to set a deadline for you. However, because you have not responded, I will be more clear. I am willing to wait until 11:59 p.m., PST, on Wednesday, September 29, 2010 for you to provide a reasonable explanation for the accusations listed on the livejournal link in my comment below. If you delete either of these posts, or if you do not respond by that time, I will understand that as you acknowledging that the accusations are true. At that point I plan to block you as a user and do what I can to make it known on goodreads that you have acknowledged the accusations. I recommend you post your explanation here on your own profile for future reference in case this issue comes up again. (At this point, the accused member sent me a PM with the quoted language in the message below.)message 12: Sep 28, 2010 01:45pm[The accused member] Wrote: ""I saw the first line on your comment to me and couldn't read any further.

I'm left to assume that you mean that you cannot read anything derisive about yourself. I think it has come to a point where you might need to learn how to read that type of material, as many people, including myself, are prepared to take your silence on the topic as admission of guilt.

97,478160288,05/03/2017,2.0,"Universally loathed and loved by so many. Before reading, I browsed reviews from friends who I respect and saw a mixed consensus there, too. I was surprised a few of them rated so highly, but even though I hated the movie, I won't diss a book until I've read it myself.. I have a friend offline who warned me the writing was atrocious, and another offline friend who is a huge fan of the books and told me they were much better than the movie. Because of all this conflicting stuff, I didn't know what to expect going in.What I found was a poorly written book that made me cringe and get annoyed, but was strangely difficult to put down and made a quick read. Pros - » Strangely hard to put down - is witchcraft involved?» The overly simple writing style makes it a quick read» Bella is clumsy. I like clumsy characters.» I like stories set in schools and/or small towns.» Um. Charlie seems like a decent father. (Although the parenting situation comes off kind of weird)» It got younger generations back into reading» At least sunblock wasn't involved....Cons -» Edward changes his moods way too much. I couldn't keep up. I can get a character or person occasionally changing three emotions in one minute with one dialogue exchange, but to have it happen every time made me want to scream and pound the walls. It was so annoying. » The author relied too much on facial expressions. How many times can his face turn stone cold, his lips deadline and flatten, his smile disappear, he half smile, he almost smile, he...? Argh.» Why was Bella obsessed with him from the beginning when he didn't know her and already acted like a jerk? She would have had no emotional bond unless it was a fated-to-be-mated type of story.» Why does Bella spend her life upset he's not paying attention to her, but when he finally does, she gets instantly mad at a lame joke and stalks off upset??» Why is there so much angst?» If Bella is so average, why does every guy want to be with her when she comes back to town? She seems like a magnet.» Why does her blood smell so unique/good? It's admitted it does to other vamps as well but not to the degree it does Edward. Does this mean it really is a fated-to-be-mated type of story and the author just never explains it? The smell angle has been used in other FTBM books.» How can she be okay when he tells her if they stay together no sex will be involved, ever? Eek.» Why can't she write her poor mother longer e-mails?» It spawned ""the movies""» The writing is awkward and inconsistent with its rhythm, especially during the first half when they author was trying to find her footing.» The sparkling thing was lame, but it was less lame in the book than the movie. The baseball game was just as lame - maybe more so - in the book. Seriously, out there no one could hear the impact. If they could, would thunder really cover the sound? And the bats would break?Overall it was a strange experience. I groaned most of the time and wanted to strangle the two main characters. The angst was real. The emotions were silly. It was taking YA and young hormones to a Romeo and Juliet level. Since I read so many paranormal Fated-to-be-mated books I'm convinced this is secretly one and the author didn't flesh that detail out. FTBM are the only ones who can convincingly do or die in books, they are attracted by the smell of their mates, they never have interest in anyone other than their mates, they get obsessively clingy and needy, and they're always meant to be together no matter what. Yes with this book no one is seeing that, including the other vamps who would know if they could possibly be FTBM because of the possibility of that in the world-building, so it's like the author just took the symptoms of that trope type but didn't actually have it.

This series was a complete game changer for me! I'm crazy in love with Bella and Edward's love story.Reading TWILIGHT is always a 
magical 
experience for me. Reading it for the first time changed my life. Twilight will always have a very special place in my heart. If not number one. Many Twilight fanfiction has been published since this first came out-only with changed names-but I still have to say the original story is my favorite. I was late into the Twilight universe and was very hesistant to read them but i wanted to see what all he fuss was about. I wasn't at all a reader back then so obviously this was the first one in this genre I read. And it took me a while untill i was sold on this book. But when I was it was magical! I adored everything about the world Stehenie Meyer created in Forks. First, Bella and Edward's epic love story COMPLETELY SPELLBOUND  me. I found the fact that he was a 100+ year old vampire, trapped inside a 17 year old body, completely miserable as a vampire, to finally find his true love with Bella, so romantic. Some people found it creepy but.... come on people, this is fiction. Don't take things so seriously. I think Twillight is the only book I have read and started again right away when I was done, so much do I love it. I must have read it 10+ times in about 5 years. And everytime it's like coming home. I seriously don't think any book series ever has or ever will hold a grip like Twilight did over me ever again. I read every four books in a week. Needless to say that thrilled would be a understatement of what I'd be if Stephenie Meyer would finish Midnight Sun!

99,21814239,05/07/2008,1.0,"(First part borrowed from an Amazon review, because it says the same thing I'm thinking, just better:)---------------------------------------------------------This is quite literally a romance novel, but written with teenagers in mind. It has all the prerequisites of your run-of-the-mill romance (note that I don't say ""good"" or even ""mediocre""). Let's check them off:1) Impossibly beautiful heroine who has no idea she's beautiful.2) Mysterious two-dimensional hero with a dark secret.3) Frequent urple prose descriptions of hair and eye colors.4) The doormat of a heroine needs rescuing every few pages.5) The Neanderthal of a hero runs roughshod over any opinions and desires the heroine has of her own, unless, of course, they coincide with his.6) They suddenly fall in love. No build up, no rationalization, no sense, just a statement of illogical fact.7) The hero's Deep Dark Secret is revealed and much angsting on his part ensues.8) Out of nowhere the heroine's life is threatened and she makes an incredibly stupid decision that nearly kills her.9) Rescue at the last minute and declarations of twu lurv all around.Bella's character itself gets more and more annoying as the book goes on. To the point where you want to slap her and yell at her to stop making the female half of the species look bad. I've seen jellyfish with more spine than she exhibits through most of the book. She lets Edward dictate to her and push her around and never does more than sulk and glare. She never makes any real attempt at enforcing her own opinions/desires. The one time she actually shows some initiative, it's to do something so deeply stupid that you wish the two-dimensional bad guy had just killed her and taken her out of the breeding pool.And goodness gracious, has this woman no common sense? I can give no credence to her claim of having grown up in a big city, not when she goes wandering brainlessly on her own down empty streets in an unfamiliar city. No woman who grows up in even a small city would do such a thing. We know better. Bella acts more like she grew up in the suburbs or the country, where they're still under the delusion that crime can't touch them there. She'd be far more believable as a character if that was the background she'd been given. But coming from Phoenix? I don't think so. It just makes her look like, ""All new: Victim Barbie! Push a button and she screams for her man to rescue her!""---------------------------------------------------It should also be noted that this is a looooong book. Not long as in ""many pages"", but long as in ""many pages without anything happening"". I mean, ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" are both under 200 pages, so is it unreasonable to expect a book that goes past 200 pages to actually, I dunno, do something? I didn't have the heart or the time to pick up the next two books, but Mayreen did. So I had Mayreen tell me what happens in the next two books (1200+ pages total). It took her about 10 minutes to summarize the story. And I am confident the 10 minute summary was just as thrilling and engaging as the actual act of reading the 1200 pages.To put it another way, they are making a movie of this book. Usually, when you hear they are making a movie of a book, you wonder ""What will they take out?"". For the first time in my life, I actually wondered ""How are they going to squeeze 80 minutes of story out of this book?""***Apologies to Katherine, Mayreen and the other women in my life who enjoyed this book. I may not understand what this book does for you, but I am not making a judgment towards what may have happened to both of your historically excellent tastes in books.

103,28852917,07/31/2008,1.0,"Where to begin with this book?I guess I should start with a quick summary: Bella is a 17 year old who moves from sunny Phoenix to a tiny town called Forks in rainy Washington state. After she enrolls in the local high school, she finds herself fascinated with the Cullen family, all of them beautiful and mysterious. As she grows closer to the youngest, Edward Cullen, she discovers their secret (they're vampires), and falls madly in love.Okay, that done, let's get on with the main review. . . Confession: I only bought this book to make fun of it. I'd read a lot of hilarious parodies, as well as a few painful excerpts, and decided it would be amusing enough to keep me interested. To be fair to Meyer, it wasn't quite as awful as I'd heard. My guilty pleasure has always been wangsty supernatural romances, after all. That said, it still has a long list of faults and parts of it were absolutely laughable.To begin with, until Bella explicitly stated her age, I thought she was 15. She's shallow, mean (her casual, often condescending criticisms of her classmates and the small town make her seem like a total brat), and generally just feels incredibly young. I don't think Meyer really remembers what it's like to 17; that's the only explanation I have for this flaw. Although I fully admit to being shallow when I was that age, I wasn't quite as shallow or dim as Bella and so my overall first impression was how immature the so-called heroine is.She's also stupid. Really, really stupid. There's a section of the book where Edward, once Bella knows his true vampire nature, takes her far away from the town to a secluded forest, and basically tells her that he chose this place in case he loses control and murders her. He even warns her that she might never return home, and insinuates that his family is preparing to clean up after him. Bella's response? Oh, she doesn't care! She KNOWS he'd never hurt her! I mean, she's only known this weird boy for a few weeks/months (and for most of that time he avoided her), and he's only a vampire fighting against his base nature and living on a knife edge, so obviously she's, like, totally safe! I suppose we, the reader, are supposed to think that this is already Twu Wub even though barely any time has passed, and that Bella is just, like, SO brave, but she just reads as a total moron. I was also really uncomfortable with how abusive Edward sounds during these scenes where he warns her that he might just murder her where she stands. He MIGHT kill her but only because she just smells so scrumptious! It's totally her fault! It's just far too reminiscent of 'I only hit you because I love you, baby'.As if that isn't bad enough, we're told that (aside from her delicious scent) Edward is drawn to Bella because she's the only person whose mind he cannot read (yes, he reads minds as well as being super fast, strong, and immortal), and because she 'responds so differently' to everyone else. She does? When? As far as I could see, she acts like a typical shallow American teenager up until she starts telling him that it's okay if he kills her, because she knows he loves her oh so much! So basically Edward loves her because she's a victim.Speaking of Edward, he's not without flaws either. Although Meyer paints him as a typical angsty vampire; fighting against his thirst for human blood so that he can love again, he's often boring and expressionless, and his constant drama was absolutely sickening. By the end of the book, I thought I'd throw up if I had to hear, yet again, how torn he is as he looks into Bella's eyes. Not to mention how he's just SO beautiful and perfect and angelic. Hell, he's so angelic that he freakin' sparkles in direct sunlight.HE SPARKLES, PEOPLE. Enough said.The romance, once you get passed all the angst and purple prose over Edward's incredible beauty, is only okay. Bella and Edward can never have sex, apparently, and can barely even kiss, so there are lots of scenes where Edward teases Bella with his light touches whilst her heart stops. No, really; at one point Meyer actually writes that Bella's heart stops so noticeably at Edward's touch that the EKG machine she's hooked up to picks it up, which is actually a sign of a major cardiac condition. Oh, he also makes her faint at least once. How realistic! Either his touch is really magical, or Bella has a heart problem and will die by age 30 from massive cardiac arrest.When there's about one third of the book left, Meyer seems to realise that she'll never get published if something doesn't actually happen, so she throws in a villain and has Bella being hunted by another vampire, one who does not abstain like the wonderful, all-American baseball playing Cullens. Suddenly, Edward's family, who has only met Bella a handful of times, races to save her from this evil man, and even goes on to tell her they love her, even though they hardly know her. D'aww! She's just so speshul. This is, however, my favourite part of the book because the pace actually picks up for the first time, and eventually Bella has the shit kicked out of her. YAH! I was cheering the baddie on but, boo, Edward rushes in to save her, and in her haze of pain she believes him to be an angel because he's JUST SO BEAUTIFUL. Meyer just wants to drive that home, as if we didn't even know from the previous 300+ pages of her going on about this.The book ends with Edward taking Bella to prom. Yes, really. And, suddenly, Bella knows she wants to be a vampire, because it's true love and it will last forever! It's not as if we ALL thought our first love would last forever back when we were kids/teenagers, but Bella KNOWS this because Edward is just so special and beautiful and hawt! She gives absolutely no thought to how this will change her life. In fact, she's so needy that she panics when Edward mentions leaving her to protect her from further attacks by rogue vampires, and is so disgustingly upset by the mere insinuation that I think she borders on the deranged. However, considering Edward's confession to stalking her earlier in the novel (he watches her sleep and follows her everywhere, just like a 'normal' boyfriend!), I shouldn't be surprised. Edward, however, is not willing to inflict upon Bella the PAIN and SUFFERING that is his undead life. And so the book ends.As much as I dislike this book, I do understand why some people are so nuts for it. Meyer is unabashedly over the top with her depiction of Bella and Edward's love, and it has everything that every other vampire book has ever covered; angst, mortality vs immortality, bad vampires vs good, beautiful characters, the heroine being supposedly 'special', etc. Over all, though, it cannot hold a candle to previous books of this genre and is just a shoddy rehashing of a very old story. And when I say 'shoddy', I mean it. The prose is clumsy and stilted, and there were a number of what I hope were editing errors, because otherwise Meyer has the worst grammar I've ever seen printed.Big thumbs down from me. But fun if you're willing to laugh at such drivel!",40,0.9982,0.111,0.719,0.17,0.5825729567189194,NEGATIVE,0.9995

111,691116818,08/10/2013,1.0,"My review of the ""Critically acclaimed"" (how? How? HOW!?) novel TWILIGHT Is it possible for someone to like both Twilight and Pride and Prejudice? I ask because I feel as though I'm about to get kicked in the literary nards again. The last time I stepped on a chick-lit favorite, Jane Austen's dull, but well written ""romance"", I was described as someone who ""lacks the will to understand,"" and that was one of the more flattering comments! So you can see why I'm a little hesitant reviewing Twilight.Here's my problem with Stephenie Meyer's debut novel: Twilight reads just like a novel written by an over-imaginative pre-teen, only without any evidence of editing or skill, or even a grasp of the English language. Tenses are put through a food processor and the characters have no more depth than the pretty posters we all saw for the horrible movies. Bella, the character is all over the board. Half the time her emotional state is completely incongruent to the scene she is in. It's as if Meyer kept a hat near her computer and pulled from it scraps of paper with the words mopey, or angry, or depressed, written on them.It's rainy outside, let's see what the magic Emo hat says Bella should feel...hmm...hate. ""I hate anything that's wet."" What a great line--AND YES, THAT'S IN THE BOOK! How long did it take her to think up that one? And why was it left in by the editors?Sadly, there are more that are even worse: ""The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born.""Been belonged? What the hell is that?Here's another line that I just had to read over and over wondering how it made it into the book: ""Through their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular.""Through their noses???? I'm clueless what that's supposed to mean. And, what's, with, all, the, commas,?Then there are the endless repetitious 'perfect' descriptions of Edward: His perfect golden eyes smoldered heatedly out from his flawless and perfect brow so that the ocher perfectly singed me with their perfection and heat--I exaggerate, but only barely.It makes me wonder how this became a New York Times ""Editor's choice."" Or how on earth it could be described as ""The best book of the Year"" by Publisher's Weekly? I can only surmise that there weren't any other books written that year.I just don't get it. It is a complete mystery how someone can become a millionaire writing like this. Maybe I should not start stopping, practicing to write weller than I does.I could be famous too.PS Can anyone tell me why girls fall for Edward when it's obvious he's gay. Let's look at the facts as presented by the book: He's a smart dresser. He's neat and trim. He sparkles, ""smells fruity,""(what?) and has a musical voice...la, la, la, la. Clearly he's not just gay, but flaming, feather boa-wearing, ""I'm a dancer"" gay. (Not that there's anything wrong with that--it's just an observation.)PPS Even more of a question is how anyone can find Bella appealing? She's so proudly klutzy(why?) that she can't walk into a bathroom without fear of falling in the toilet--trust me when I say it's not an endearing trait. She's also annoyingly condescending to everyone. To call her moody is a joke. She's bi-polar with a side-order of manic. In the space of a minute she can be laughing, glaring angrily and crying. Yet all the boys want her. I get that Edward is using her as ""cover"" but the rest of them? It stretches the limits of fiction.If you enjoyed this review you'll probably like my Youtube reviews--be warned, I enjoy some good snark!

112,134816256,12/12/2010,2.0,"well here's what i learned in a group last week: apparently the way to get hundreds upon hundreds of ongoing votes on Goodreads is to simply write a review of Twilight, any kind of review, a review that hates or loves or is lukewarm or is scornful or is a big sloppy wet kiss or is all lyrics or is one joke or one word or one bit of punctuation, just any old review really - and then all of a sudden magic happens, a wonderful Goodreads circle jerk ensues, all those overwhelming feelings of connection and community come to the forefront of the mind, maybe even back to the reptile part of the brain... and instant Likes spontaneously generate like fruitflies over garbage. it seems that people can't control themselves: their adoration of bella and edward and sparkly sparkle type things takes over, stiffening and moistening happens uncontrollably, the very mind glazes over, the finger starts twitching and it is Like Like Like Like Like, as if pushing Like is somehow connecting with the novel itself, as if choosing to Like is like spurting your appreciation of the novel all over the keyboard. ecstasy in one small left click. la petite mort, ooo-la-la, delish!so let's conduct a community experiment: how long can a Twilight review go with no Likes? i have a theoretical respect for the human mind and feel that the Twilight community is certainly one representation of humanity, a sparkly one perhaps, but nonetheless humans who can control their Like-ability if pressed. therefore you are encouraged to not Like this review. and there is a very good chance it does not Like you in return! just say no kids, just say no.oh and here's the review itself: i did not find it to be a truly bad novel. it was dull. it was a fast read. i read it in the back of a moving car. i probably should have engaged in conversation instead. i discovered that i do not like sparkle magic. i preferred the film. the film was also rather dull. end review.",37,0.9926,0.061,0.731,0.208,0.4769523809523809,NEGATIVE,1.0

116,31590324,08/30/2008,1.0,"Okay. I had to know. All right, so, everyone's frothing or squeeing about this series. I'd made my thoughts on what I'd heard pretty clear, but I thought I'd have a quick look at the actual text. Bear in mind that these thoughts were noted while I was only 108 pages in.Oh boy.1. Stephanie Meyer. I don't know how she got printed. Seriously. Every four sentences in five is 'I did this'. Where is the 'show, don't tell'? Most of it's about as interesting as reading someone's 'to do' list. And there have been some truly odd turns of phrase, and some word usages that are just bizarre.For example: I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish.How the hell do you walk alertly? And, O HAI THAR, another sentence starting with 'I'. Writing class 101: CHANGE STUFF AROUND. 'After Spanish, Jessica and I walked to the cafeteria.' See what I did there? It only took me five seconds.I've lost count of the amount of repetitions and gratuitous mentions of Edward's eye colour and general beauty. WE GET IT, OKAY?2. Bella. I know teenagers have a fuck-off attitude, but seriously, this girl just doesn't give a shit about anyone, does she? And not in an angry, petulant, stuff-you-all-you-don't-know-what-it's-like way; she's about as emotionally responsive as a clam. She claims she never had friends in Phoenix, and yet she's too cool for anyone who tries to be nice to her in Forks? Please. Anyone that aloof is either completely self obsessed and up themselves, or... no, that's it. She's not just in her own little pity party, she's detached from everyone around her. This level of detachment isn't normal, and suggests to me some kind of psychopathology. (Possibly related to the brain tumour or degenerative neurological disease that makes her fall over more than a toddler.) With the amount of time she spends trying to shake off her new friends or just tuning them out while they're talking to her, I'm surprised they didn't just give up on her within a couple of days. Also, that self pity? Really gets old when she's so obviously vain and shallow.3. Edward. Yes, I know a lot of people swoon over him, but seriously, he makes every cell in my body scream, ""RUN!"" And, no, it's not because he'd want to eat me like a snack, but because the more I read of him, the more things I'm checking off on my list of ""Hallmarks of a Predator"". No, not that kind of predator. I mean the kind who gets insanely jealous when their partner talks on the phone, and listens into their conversations. The kind who monitors their partner's every movement. The kind whose behaviour is erratic from one day to the next, or even one minute to the next, so that eventually their partner doesn't know if laughing at a joke will get her hit, or not laughing at it will get her hit. The kind who tells their partner over and over that they can't take care of themselves, that they'd be lost without them, that they love them so much it makes them crazy sometimes. The kind that flips out, and then the partner ends up having to apologise. Because, after all, it was the partner's fault for setting them off.Any of this ringing any bells?I had a fair bit of counselling in my teens, from the age of eleven to about sixteen. One thing that I learnt a lot about is how abusers work, and most of it's not the physical violence. Most of it is emotional manipulation and battering. I have a very good radar for creeps. Have done since I was about six years old, and I first laid eyes on my mum's best friend's new fiancée. Knew he set all my alarms ringing, when I saw him from across the room, before I ever spoke to him. Didn't know why. It came out when I was in my teens, after he was killed in a car accident, that he'd been beating mum's friend for years. All I knew was that he made my skin crawl.Meyer has created a remote, erratic, controlling boy with Godlike powers, and a weak, narcissistic, constantly-needing-rescue girl, trapped in what she perceives to be a dull life. But Bella isn't trapped at all; she went to Forks on purpose, and then decided to act like a martyr about it. And like those women that always manage to find abusive boyfriends, she decides to seek out the one boy at school who doesn't treat her nicely, because she wants the thrill.If Edward and Bella were a regular couple, no sparkles involved, I'd predict domestic or verbal violence within a year or two of marriage, if not before. And it makes me seriously concerned for Meyer's own marriage, if this is the way she thinks the 'perfect' man should behave and treat someone.Edward is no Mr Darcy, who is rude and sarcastic and hides his love. Darcy has reasons for his obnoxious behaviour that are grounded in the field of normal, believable human emotion and reaction. Edward is dangerous because he seems to think that his behaviour is perfectly reasonable, and it's not. Edward isn't mysterious, and he's not tragic. He's coercive and emotionally abusive from the first time he speaks to Bella, and it has nothing to do with his vampirism. He's utterly condescending to her, and treats her like she couldn't take two steps without him. (And let's face it, she probably can't.)To be brutally honest, for all that they were set two centuries ago, Austen's novels come across as more progressive than Twilight. At least Elizabeth Bennet and Elinor Dashwood has some fight in them, and some self respect. They were assertive, and they exercised the freedoms they had in the society they lived in. Besides making some vague references to Bella having read some classic works of fiction and having listened to classical music, she comes across as ignorant, dull and apathetic. She does nothing but go to school, cook for her father, drive her truck and stalk Edward. Where are her interests? What does she feel? She's utterly flat. Maybe in Meyer's head, and in the heads of people who project themselves into her shoes, Bella seems three dimensional, but the actual meat of it sure isn't there on the page. In fact, we know more about what she doesn't like and doesn't care about than what she actually does like. It would be different if she cooked because she genuinely enjoyed it, but she seems to only do it because she seems to think her father would starve without it. Really, how does someone so clumsy, who faints at the slightest hint of blood, cook at all? Does she wear baseball gloves whenever she has to handle knives?Anyway, I really can't be bothered writing any more. If I had actually finished the book I might have had more to say, but every new page made me cringe. My advice, if you can't keep away? Read Cleolinda's summaries of the whole series instead.",36,-0.987,0.137,0.752,0.111,0.5331166940237737,NEGATIVE,0.9999
117,2347197700,04/01/2018,4.0,"Yes, I’m giving Twilight four stars. Bear with me.I read this series for the first time when I was 11, and then again when I was 13. I found them to be highly enjoyable then, but felt a bit embarrassed about it, eagerly agreeing with those who critiqued the series.However, as I’ve grown older, my memories for the series remained fond. Even with its silliness of sparkling vampires and sexy shirtless werewolves, I couldn’t deny that I’d had fun with them and that they were a staple of my younger self’s reading experience.Because of that, I kept the entire series, which seems to always be the first to draw the attention of anyone who sees my shelves. I’m often asked if Twilight is really good, leaving me at a bit of a loss for a response.Is Twilight actually a good book?I decided the best way to find out would be to embark on a reread.I have been reading YA since I started middle school. I was there for the paranormal romance trend and the dystopian craze. I’ve seen YA grow from a floundering mess of tropes into a something admirable. Diversity has finally stopped being a rarity in YA (though improvement is to be made), and I rarely find new books being published that are plain bad - most are unique, well written, insightful, and books I would feel confident recommending to almost any age group.The thing is, whether you like this novel or not, you have Twilight to thank for nearly all of your favorite YA novels.First published in 2005, Twilight came before The Hunger Games and many other popular YA books. Many publishers were still under the impression that teens weren’t interested in reading, making YA novels practically abysmal - certainly not something with multiple rows in bookstores.Twilight changed all of that. An almost instant hit, it opened the door for many similar novels to be published, and with the continued success of these YA novels came more and more diverse YA novels.On top of revolutionizing the publishing industry, Twilight is responsible for turning many people into readers. Ask around in the book community and it won’t take more than a few tries to find someone who credits Twilight for sparking their love of reading. While I wouldn’t say it was the book that made me into a reader, it was one of the first YA novels I read and it definitely showed me a different type of story that renewed my interest in literature in a different way than what I had been reading previously.The amount of hate that this book gets, frankly, pisses me off. As a person who gives more negative than positive reviews, I certainly respect that anyone has the right to like or dislike any book. However, a lot of Twilight’s hate comes from middle aged men with nothing better to do than hate on anything that they think teenage girls enjoy without actually knowing or caring about the contents of the book.Twilight, despite its flaws, has numerous strengths. The writing, which is highly criticized, is something I actually quite appreciate. As someone who has seen so much worse, I like that the writing in Twilight is incredibly approachable. It’s simple, sure, with some awkward phrasing here and there, but most of the word choice is strong and Bella’s inner monologue serves to help develop her as a character.Bella is another oft nitpicked element of this story. People describe her as a Mary Sue, a girl who doesn’t believe herself to be pretty while guys fall at her feet.While it can be repetitive, the Mary Sue trope doesn’t even make my top ten in terms of my least favorite tropes. Sure, I’ve complained about it in some books, but y’know what? There’s nothing wrong with seeing an insecure girl allowed to be the hero. What’s wrong with allowing women to feel like they see themselves in a main character? To feel that they too have potential to be the hero and win the hot vampire boyfriend? Sure, Bella is clumsy, stubborn, and prone to insecurity, but who isn’t? It’s what makes her character so relatable and, in my opinion, kind of endearing.Also, Twilight is nowhere near as bad as most of the paranormal romances that followed it. You think this is bad? Try Halo.I also want to praise Twilight for having mostly positive female relationships. Bella gets along with more girls than she doesn’t, and I was prepared from some intense girl hate and slut shaming, as I’ve basically come to expect it from any book in the genre (just look at Beautiful Creatures), so I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is barely any at all here. Bella develops a friendship with Alice that burgeons over the course of the series, and while she doesn’t initially get along with Rosalie, it’s not senseless hate or some bitchy rivalry - Rosalie’s initial disliking of Bella stems from her own background and she becomes much more complex throughout the series.As far as the relationship goes, I see why so many people take issues with Edward’s pushiness. Personally, I think that in the context of a contemporary novel, Edward’s behavior would be unacceptable. However, his attitude to me seems more consistent with the fact that he’s supposed to be an extremely dangerous vampire that’s over 100 years old. Yeah, he can be kind of a dick, but it makes sense for him to be abrasive and unsure of how to interact with a human. I will call him out on the reckless driving though - it’s one of my biggest pet peeves, so I feel Bella there.Anyway, I think I’m always going to view Twilight more fondly than not. It reminds me of a rain streaked forest (what? The Pacific Northwest is hella pretty) and being young and willing to just be immersed in a story no matter how ridiculous some of the content may be.So yeah, I like Twilight. Bite me. (view spoiler)[I can’t believe I just made a pun that awful, but I’m leaving it lmao (hide spoiler)]I for one will always be grateful to this story for opening doors for the book community to become what it is today. Also, I kind of owe it for one of my favorite shows as a teen, The Vampire Diaries. Looking forward to continuing the series and rewatching the adaptations!",36,0.9991,0.111,0.682,0.207,0.5511326433982682,POSITIVE,0.9997
118,327498628,05/10/2012,,"I'll leave part of my review below because it was interesting for me to look back on, but I am removing my ratings for this series. Google the racism. I know these books are old news and my ratings wouldn't make any impact on their success but I don't want to contribute to the average score in any way.-----------------------------------------------When I first read Twilight I was maybe 21, 22? The movie was in the works but not out yet and I had been hearing lots of people getting excited about it. I read the book and could see why; I absolutely loved it. Here is what probably contributed to me loving it the most : I was young, single, and a hopeless romantic. There is no doubt about it, this book appeals to young girls.The single most fascinating thing to me about the book was the way that the book made me FEEL. Bella was extremely relateable to me at that time, and despite what anyone wants to say about Stephenie Meyer's writing skills, she somehow made me feel everything that Bella felt as she was feeling it, and I had never experienced that with a book before.So, now that it has been 5 years since I first read the book and I am now married and don't have my head in the clouds, I decided that it would be interesting to re-read the series and see if it really was as awful as people like to say. This time I didn't feel moved by any of the romantic scenes. However, I was surprised that I felt a sense of urgency from the conflict in the book, which I had always remember as hating. It's not a good example of normal human relationships, but this is a fantasy fiction novel, it's not meant to be anything other than entertainment and I believe/hope most readers are intelligent enough to know which parts of the romance are unhealthy. The book didn't particularly hold my interest now as an adult, but I appreciate the sense of excitement it gave me when I was younger as well as the memories I have with friends.",31,0.9926,0.09,0.719,0.191,0.4777255639097744,NEGATIVE,0.9896

It's possible to just look pass all the cliches and the cringy-ness and trick yourself into a 1 hour trance where you're just lying there reading this book completing ignoring the fact that you could be reading other literary successes. At least that's what happened to me. ____________________Because I believe vulnerability is necessary, so I'll confess that twilight at one point in my life, was everything. Here's to revisiting my dark past.

I read reviews saying how much they hate this story and the characters! I don't know why! Whats the problem? because vampires sparkle in Twilight Saga? Why some people can't accept the fact that Stephenie Meyer created her Vampires in a much beautiful way in which the Vampires sparkle like the angels? What if they sparkle? Is that a bad idea? and Bella Swan is not naive she is just an innocent teen girl.I respect everyone's thoughts. so its not necessary that everyone should like/read this novel. So if you hate this novel, just ignore, move on! Criticizing, or analyzing a work of art is okay, but 'hateful- criticism' is not right.

124,100542386,04/28/2010,2.0,"Well just to post another unpopular review (there are lots of books I do love, just look at my favourites!) ... here's one I wrote for Mercatornet.com a while ago.It is hard not to notice when a book takes off like a bushfire around the teen/tween female population...Twilight is the story of 17-year-old Isabella Swan and her “forbidden love” relationship with Edward Cullen, a vampire who masquerades as a human.Bella is plain, clumsy and prone to accidents, but having recently moved to rainy Forks she enjoys popularity as the new girl. She has no real friends -- none that she spends unforced time with. She has a shallow relationship with her father, Charlie, whom she “hates lying to” even though she does so frequently since, “for his own good”, he remains ignorant about vampires. While Edward is always telling Bella how selfless she is, she never does anything to support the theory. All she wants is for him to make her a vampire so that she can be breathless in his presence 24/7 for all eternity.Edward should be 100, but since vampires do not age he has remained 17. He is perfect in every regard (beauty, strength, speed, intelligence, immortality...) but, strangely, he never fell in love until he met Bella, to whose blood scent he is irresistibly attracted.Jacob Black is a 16-year-old werewolf, mortal enemy of vampires. His declaration of love for Bella turns the romance into a love triangle.One thing is for certain: it is not characterisation that makes these books irresistible to adolescent girls. It's romance, of a sort. What is more, Bella’s ordinary, vaguely sketched looks allow any female reader to put herself in place of the heroine. Tens of thousands are joining Facebook and MySpace groups such as, “I am absolutely in love with Edward Cullen”, or signing on as friends to his hundreds of profiles. No need to be beautiful, just hide behind a pretty name and you can still manage to attract the most perfect guy in existence -- it’s a teenage girl’s dream.Sensuality, with a dash of ‘virtue’For parents, however, Meyers’ romantic world is a nightmare. While there is, technically, no premarital sex in the books, sex is a big part of what they’re about. The characters’ dominant -- almost exclusive -- trait is emotional (hormonal) sensitivity. The tone is one of perpetual breathlessness brought on by intense physical attraction. The language is very, very sensual. For example:“Bella?” I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious face just inches from mine. My heart stopped beating.“Sleep well,” he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It was the same exquisite scent that clung to his jacket, but in a more concentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away.I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself...” (Twilight, p193)By book three things are more explicit:“Bella...” He shook his head slowly, but it didn’t feel like a denial as his face, his lips, moved back and forth across my throat. It felt more like surrender. My heart, racing already, spluttered frantically...He did not stop kissing me. I was the one who had to break away, gasping for air. Even then his lips did not leave my skin, they just moved to my throat... (Eclipse, p449)Meyer told the London Times she finds it “fun” to write about teen romance: “It’s the first time you fall in love, it’s the first time you kiss somebody. All those feelings are so much stronger. You are not calloused up yet...” Not yet. But, by leading girls down the path of sexual fantasy, she hastens the day when the callouses appear.The odd thing is that Meyer is an observant Mormon. She attended Brigham Young University (run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) where premarital sex is considered “a violation of the honour code”. As a mother of three boys she hates to see young people “screw up” their lives with sex and she hopes her sons “are smart enough to…make the right choices”. With their mother as guide they’ll have to be more than smart.“The right choices” in her fictional world are about not falling off a tightrope. The scene quoted above, for example, continues like this:“No,” he promised solemnly. “I swear to you, we will try. After you marry me.”I shook my head, and laughed glumly.“You make me feel like a villain in a melodrama – twirling my moustache while I try to steal some poor girl’s virtue.”His eyes were wary as they flashed across my face, then he quickly ducked down to press his lips against my collarbone.“That’s it, isn’t it?” The short laugh that escaped me was more shocked than amused. “You’re trying to protect your virtue!” I covered my mouth with my hand to muffle the giggle that followed. The words were so... old-fashioned.”“No, silly girl,” he muttered against my shoulder. “I’m trying to protect yours. And you’re making it shockingly difficult.” (Eclipse, pp452-453)In the midst of all this sensuality the sudden appearance of restraint seems incongruous -- if not dishonest. “Virtue” turns out to be simply a line that can’t be crossed. Keep a sheet between you and it is all OK. But who could go that far and maintain real virtue? Sounds like a recipe for a lot of baby Junos with jaded teenage mums.Meyer seems to think a “thou shalt not” ethic is a soul’s ticket to heaven: “Most religions believe there are some rules to follow,” says Edward piously. Rules. What a contrast to John Paul II’s “theology of the body”, which understands sex, relationships and affectivity as wonderful dimensions of human life, to be guarded and affirmed, not simply out of a fear of hell but to enable human beings to reach their full potential in a free and total gift of self.Other problemsThere are several other problems with these romances. Edward’s struggle to control his monstrous desire for Bella’s blood make human desires seem wonderfully natural by comparison. How bad can sex be compared to killing someone and feeding on their blood? The moral benchmark has moved way off centre.There is a complete lack of realism in the expectations placed on the male in this relationship. After a century of resisting human blood, this vampire has the strength to resist crossing the sexual line too. But leading a girl to believe she can push a guy this far and then expect him to be as strong as Edward is unrealistic and unfair. Mind you, many girls are clued up to this lack of realism: see the Facebook groups Because I read Twilight I have unrealistic Expectations in Men (53,547 members) and After Reading Twilight, Human Boys Just Seem Lacking (19,413 members). But if you read the wall posts, it doesn’t stop them wishing.Another concern is the mocking of parental authority. When Bella’s father tries to give her the “responsible sex” talk she is able to shout at him “I’m a virgin!” She knows that Charlie would freak out if he knew Edward spent the night in her room (watching her, because vampires can’t sleep), but she dismisses his concern exclaiming “nothing’s going to happen!” Then, in the very next paragraph she is breathless (again), and he’s struggling not to give in to his desires.And what messages are coming to girls through all of this? The only thing that makes life worth living is having your (irresistibly attractive) man. Forget all your other aspirations, friends, family, interests, education... Growing old is a fate worse than death. Love is based on appearances and physical attraction.One of the most serious issues is the glorification of obsessive love, an intensely emotional experience which is more important than life itself, yours or anyone’s. Then there’s the problem of having this obsessive love for more than one person at the same time. Jacob also loves Bella, and she realises she loves him too (a bit of kissing helps this along). Many girls have told me how desperate they find this: “She’s fully fallen in love with two people, both love her truly, this is an impossible dilemma, how can she live?”Based on Twilight’s definition of the word, it is possible to fall in “love” with any number of people. Yet, in the real world, people do live, and what’s more, they really learn to love, sometimes giving up a love they might feel because it’s not right (for example, the person is married to someone else), or many times learning to love a person once feelings have faded, or rather, have deepened and matured. But when Jacob gives up Bella at the end of book three, he appears completely emotionally crushed. The message is that it’s not really possible to live if you have to give up this kind of love.There are serious consequences for marriage. It is presented as a commitment based on this intense feeling of desire, when a person is so essential to your happiness that you can’t live without them. I’m not sure that many marriages would last long with that premise.What there is not in these books is the usual trash talk one finds in young adult literature -- no drugs, alcohol, dirty jokes, just a lot of sensuality and obsessive love to make up for it.To read, or not to read?In view of all that, should we just tell teens “Don’t read it!”? I don’t think so. The books are not obscene, and many good kids have found practically nothing wrong with them. A few have felt the need to read a book on true love after reading this series, but most think it’s just the author’s skill that makes them so engrossing. So there is a lot of ground to cover, and that might be impossible if all you tell them is “don’t read it!” I suggest the Twilight saga falls into the “read and talk about” category.Ask the girls who read them: What do you think about this scene? What’s missing there? What else could she have done? If you were in this situation, what would you do? What would be the best thing to do? Do you think there is anything more to relationships than this?Can you think of one guy like Edward? Do you think it’s very realistic to pressure a guy like that and expect him not to give in? What’s a more likely response or action from a guy? What do you think is the right thing for a guy to do in this situation? How could you help him do what’s right?This kind of discussion can be invaluable for good kids to help them avoid naively falling into situations they don’t know how to deal with. It also develops mature readers; when a book does not offer great role models it can still help readers to think for themselves. That is worth encouraging.Looking at the themes introduced in these books, where emotions play such an important role, it is important to open readers to the much broader panorama of what love can bring to life. (Someone, please, write a novel, any genre, that gives teens something they can chew on, something they can feel with and learn with, not preachy, just honest.)Love is not about having to live restraint in order not to mess up an unbroken record. Affectivity, the connection between body and soul, is not fully human when the soul is just a slave to the body and emotions. It reaches its full potential when human beings are able to make a true gift of themselves to another in a way that transcends selfishness.",28,0.9998,0.083,0.718,0.199,0.5031465185904435,NEGATIVE,0.9916
125,4159191581,08/07/2021,1.0,"Twilight is easily one the most well known and popularised novels out there, and frankly in my opinion, it wasn’t good. It had the potential to be fantastic, and I understand why many love this series, gosh, there are a lot of sexy vampires after all(of which the reader is reminded of on essentially every page of how godlike and stunning the Cullen’s are).Now, there was simply a lack of any form of personality in Bella Swan, as if the author attempted to make her as flat and bland of a character as possible. The same could be said of Edward Cullen, where there was no shred of soul or personality in his character either. Oh, maybe that’s why they suit each other so well. I mean, I get why people are Team Jacob now because at least he amused me somewhat.With regard to the plot, there simply wasn’t one. It was a lot of the same wearisome content repeated throughout and had far less action than your typical YA contemporary romance. In fact, if Edward was replaced with your typical self-obsessed high school jock, there would have been practically no change to the plot for the first 400 hundred pages. There was no sense of direction and this entire novel lacked purpose. The build up to the climax was abrupt and uninteresting, where the pinnacle of the story ended far too quickly before the novel resolved back to its dillydallying with an ending that dragged for an obscene amount of time.One somewhat positive element was that Meyer’s prose was in fact fine. It was certainly not brilliant, but it read easily and flowed well - and thankfully didn’t read like fanfiction. The issue was that the writing featured tasteless characters and a non-existent plot. It’s quite incredulous to me that such a tedious and unimaginative story was crafted here when there were fricken vampires!

133,340688811,06/01/2012,2.0,"The last time I read it, I wrote a top ten list of the Reasons to Avoid Twilight. This spring I decided to use Twilight in a first year class. My reading list also included Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Batman The Killing Joke, A History of Violence, and a couple of movies. Many people asked me ""Why?"" A valid question, I think. My answer is that we're stuck with Twilight. It's not going anywhere, and despite all the Twilight backlash, it is now a piece of pop culture that speaks to a huge portion of our society and probably always will. I understand those who refuse to analyze it, who refuse to dignify it with serious discussion, but I am not in their camp. To me, those stories that become pop culture touchstones -- be they Star Wars, Harry Potter or Twilight -- are precisely the texts we should be analyzing, quality be damned. So I went into this reading trying to keep an open mind, trying to see things in a different way. I think I succeeded, and I was surprised to discover that I was occassionally surprised. My original #10 was The pathetic nature of Meyer's men., and I stand by that. They are about as vanilla as one can get, which is the last thing you want in a Vampire. Alabaster? Yes. Vanilla? No. My #9 was that Mormon morality is not conducive to interesting Vampirism, and it's not, but I have to say that Mormon theology is a wonderful basis for the battle between the Vampires and Werewolves in Meyer's books. Recast the former as the Nephites and the latter as the Lamanites and you'll have Joseph Smith coughing up a marrow ball in his grave. Perhaps I am going to piss some of my friends off with this, but I have increasingly noticed that my #8: Teenage girl angst from a thirty-something, middle class soccer mom isn't such an anomaly. I am not sure when this new breed of mom is going to grow up, but many of them haven't yet, and the fact that Meyer writes from a teenage perspective isn't surprising to me anymore (I hasten to add that I know no ""soccer moms"" here on goodreads, I am merely surrounded by them in my real life, so please don't take it as an insult if you are reading this).Then there's #7. The total lack of meaningful conflict, the #6. Romance novel prose and #4. Movie of the week dialogue.I can't argue with those three observations. The first is bang on, and I've read a considerable amount of romance since my last reading of Twilight to know that my gut was correct on number six, and I was a screenwriter by trade, so you know what I think about my number four.(Okay, I am boring myself while writing this. Are you bored yet?)I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that my #5. The unheroic, even laughable, heroism of Bella Swan isn't entirely fair. Bella does the best with what she's got, and I don't think Meyer intended her as a hero. She's no Ripley (Alien was one of my movies this semester), nor was she ever meant to be. She's a clumsy high school student driven by her hormones, but considering the supernatural forces arrayed against her, she's stands up pretty well. Not as well as Mina Harker or Sookie Stackhouse, but pretty well. But now we come to my #3. Edward's inexplicable love for Bella and my #2. The insufferability of Bella. I was wrong about these two. First, Edward's love makes total sense. We get to hear every insipid thing flowing through Bella's brain, and when you can hear (or read) that stuff, it is almost impossible to fall in love with Bella (though I think you can have a positive response to her, even if you are a jaded cat like me), but Edward doesn't get any of that. The Bella he gets is decisive, mysterious, combative, confident, semi-intelligent and unreadable (the classic cat-nip for telepaths). If I didnn't hear her thoughts I would fall in love with Bella, and I missed that the first time through (go figure). On top of that, I didn't find Bella nearly as insufferable as I did the first time. Sure I grew annoyed with her mooning over Edward's beauty, btu I tried to put myself back to my own teenage years and imagine what it was like to be in love with curly-haired Christine in my Math class, and once I did that I could cut Bella plenty of slack. I learned no math in that class, but I can still see Christine's perfect eyelashes, long and naturaly dark, acting like eye-fireworks every time she blinked. It wasn't as bad as I remembered. Finally, my #1. was That the movie WILL BE better than the book. Well, I've since seen the movie, and I think the book is marginally better, simply because the first person narrative cannot translate to the big screen, and it makes the job of Kristin Stewart, as Bella, an impossible task. I feel for her. I really do.So there it is, my revision of what I thought the first time I tackled this book. Don't get me wrong, though. Twilight is far from great. It's okay at best. But I get why it is beloved, and I think I was a bit unfair the first time out. Will I teach it again? Maybe. But I think I'd rather teach One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich for the twentieth time. It's better. Trust me.And here's a final bit of fun for this painfully long, beast of a review -- some things asked or overheard while I was rereading this:“You hate Anna Karenina but you’re defending Twilight?! How does that work?”“Bella is perfect, except for her silly clumsiness. How convenient,” then the same person said later on, “She’s pathetic.”""Fag!"" whipered under someone's breath as I was buying wine, but it could have been because of my cut-offs rather than the book. I get that a lot. “Bella doesn’t love her family correctly.”“You’re rereading it? I’ve read it three times and I always find something I missed before. It is soooo good.”“You’re an idiot.” Indeed.",27,0.9988,0.095,0.727,0.177,0.5673940514717213,NEGATIVE,0.9802
134,11915578,01/07/2008,1.0,"All in all, this is enjoyable if you shut off your brain for a few hundred pages and pretend you are Bella Swan. It's a good beach read. It's comforting when you're locked up in a dorm room the size of a closet, attempting to study for finals. It is also (as evidenced from my review) kind of memorable.Critically speaking, though, this gets a huge NO. Also a YES. As in, NO, I do not recommend this book, and YES, this book should never have been written. I'm pretty sure it's been done about 5000x before and Stephenie Meyer has brought nothing new to the table here (with the possible exception of sparkly vampires. But What the Hell). My reasons as follows:1. Most awful characterization in a blockbuster since Dan Brown's semi-plagiarized cheap-thrills no-plot Guide to France The Da Vinci Code. However, I must say Dan is a better writer, and definitely more inventive. The comparison to TDVC does not end there. However, since each book should be evaluated individually...the characters in this book are flat without meaning to be. The only reason this book is romantic (and yes, I was a little dazzled by the romance when I first read this) is that Edward the vampire is supposed to be amazingly hot. And when I say ""supposed to be,"" I don't mean he actually is. He's boring. There are lots of pretty people who are boring as shit. He is one of them. He is not unique AT ALL and should not be written about in such a capacity. Given his penchant for sneaking into people's bedrooms and watching them sleep, he would have made a much more interesting villain. As for Bella....2. Self-indulgent. When I liked this book (somewhat, at least), I visited Stephenie Meyer's website, only to discover that yes, Bella was based on her. As suspected. Meyer is new to writing or perhaps just very bad at writing, because the author insertion is obvious and obviously unintended. Bella supposedly doesn't have faults. She exhibits the maturity of an adult around the true adults and is somehow completely ridiculous around Edward (because she's so infatuated with him? Who knows!). She isn't supposed to be a bombshell, yet every guy at her new school wants her. (Right....) If I were a guy I wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole. She's boring and annoying-- which I can only attribute to the fact that Meyer neglected to flesh her out. The biggest trap of writing about yourself is that you forget that other people don't know you as well as you do, and the resulting character becomes, well, Bella Swan.A good example of an obvious author insertion: Kurt Vonnegut in Breakfast of Champions. A good example of a standard author insertion: Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (and Ulysses, too, but I haven't read that yet). But this is silly of me. Vonnegut and Joyce are Great Writers. Hardly anyone is a Great Writer. Stephenie Meyer can put together sentences, but by no means does she write well.3. Plot: illogical, unoriginal, and boring. Everything comes out of nowhere. I don't remember it at all, except that there's prom and some lame feeble enemy vampires who come prancing along to suck some virgin blood. Whatever. The most exciting part of this book is at the beginning, when Edward is mysterious and shoots Bella glares of hatred. Downhill from there.4. I tried reading the second book and it was straight-up Boring. As in, not even a good beach read. Not even something I would want to slog through to distract me from finals. I'd rather go on Facebook.[EDIT: Took off another star for this book's disservice to humanity. Robert Pattinson? Seriously?]",27,0.8756,0.089,0.799,0.112,0.6523742219637741,NEGATIVE,0.9994

This is one of those novels that belongs on the list, ""Don't Judge Me by My Film Adaptation"" because when you compare them both, you realize there is no comparison. The book definitely takes the cake. Despite what all the haters say, I really loved this book, and honestly, it was one of the first series/books that introduced me to the wonderful world of paranormal romance, filled with naive heroines and mysteriously sexy and brooding heroes. There are so many memorable quotes in this entire series, especially this book, and my romance-loving heart just sings with happiness. I agree that neither Bella nor Edward is perfect, but my recommendation is to give this one an HONEST try--with an open mind and no previous expectations--and you might be surprised by what you find.

I will just say that I enjoyed it, though Bella was a bit obsessive at times about being with Edward all the time, Edward was a bit cold (haha pun intended) and pushy sometimes and the middle was a bit slow. The overall story was good, it really picked up toward the end and kept me entertained. I did like the love story, I just have to keep myself from thinking ""But she's only 16!"", and concentrate on the emotion between them. Sometimes Edward felt like a Harlequin hero the way he treated Bella kind of meanly and bosses her around like a child - but hey I guess I am used to that because it didn't bother me too much.One question though: How can anyone who has read this say they don't read romance?

141,29910684,08/11/2008,2.0,"I know it’s only young adult fiction, but I was appalled. I had read some online people who said this was truly atrocious and I was sure they were totally overreacting, because it couldn’t be THAT BAD. I am filled with shame for my naivete. For those of you who don’t know, it’s the story of Bella & Edward. They meet when Bella moves to WAshington to live with her father during her junior year in high school. Edward is actually a 108 year old vampire who can’t seem to find anything better to do than repeat high school over and over and over again. Oh, and Edward has a “family” of other vampires - 4 of whom play his siblings and 2 of whom play his parents. So there are 5 of them hanging out at the high school (which….WHAT? How many times can you take Biology without losing your mind?) and, of course, Bella is intrigued by them from day 1. And, wouldn’t you know it, something about Bella’s stink makes her the one true only soulmate for Edward - who can’t decide whether to marry her or eat her. At first, she thinks he hates her because he’s all angry-faced and won’t even look at her (which is only because the smell of her is beyond his ability to control his urges), but, of course, they fall truly, madly, deeply in love and have to figure out how to work her into his vampire family - she wants to become one and he doesn’t want her to. Within this not-too-bad story, there is some of the most annoying writing I’ve ever read. You see - the these vampires can’t go out in the sun, but not for the reason you think. They don’t burst into flame. They SPARKLE. Like rainbows and glitter and unicorns and prisms. Here are my thoughts:This is the second scariest “love story” I’ve ever subjected myself to - the first being the incestuous death-romp that is the Flowers in the Attic series. The fact that people are promoting this as the BESTESTTRUELOVEEVEROMG!!!!!!! story makes me cringe, weep and crap my pants at the same time. Why, why, why do people think that insane, psychotic, abusive, controlling guys are totally the hotness???I cannot fully describe to you the deep, loud, hysterical laughter that overtook me as I realized that EDWARDSPARKLES. But it totally makes sense! In the world of 14 year old girls, of course nothing truly bad would happen to the soopersexehvampire that is the embodiment of every teenage girl’s dreamguy. He couldn’t possibly, I don’t know, BURST INTO FLAME when the sun hits because how could they sit together in the lunchroom and walk moodily to class together if dude is on fire?Bella keeps describing Edward’s PERFECT, BEAUTIFULNESS as “cold, marbly hardness”. Ew. Just….oh my god, ew. How do you “snuggle up” with somebody who feels like a marble bench? That isn’t sexy or romantic or anything. It’s icky.Bella?? Cutting your brakes to keep you from visiting your BFF who’s a guy isn’t TWU WUV. It’s stalking. Coming into your room while you sleep to WATCH YOU? Isn’t romantic. It’s terrifyingly creepy. Your boyfriend isn’t supposed to order you around or tell you what you can & cannot do. The fact that your father, THE LONE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN TOWN, hasn’t started posting excerpts from “The Gift of Fear” on your bathroom mirror, on your steering wheel, in the refrigerator and as bookcovers for all of your school books is just ridiculous. Charlie might not be the most effusive parent, but he’s not BLIND. Only an idiot would miss all the signs of Edward’s scary behavior.The whining was more than I could handle. As the mother of a preteen, I have to listen to much of that every day and reading it was enough to put a gun to my head. Poor, poor Bella. Every guy at the high school wants to be the new girl’s boyfriend. They’re all falling over each other to walk you to class and take you to the dance and hit you with their car. How sad it must be for you. And, of course, you poor thing, you are just so adorably clumsy that you can’t even dance or even walk across the room without cracking your sternum, so you couldn’t think of anything more horrible than having to attend a DANCE with someone. Stupid, idiotic human boys. Because, goodness knows, you couldn’t possibly ATTEND the dance and have FUN with people you LIKE without having to do a lot of dancing. Shall I punch you in the larynx NOW or wait till that whiny noise comes out of your pie-hole again?Jacob is Bella’s BFF who, surprise surprise, is also in love with Bella. But, in Bella’s world, Edward is as essential as oxygen and she cannot exist without him. (Great lesson, Stephenie) Dude. You’re a 6′7″ hot Native American WEREWOLF. You can do 2578465847% better than Bella. Why on earth would you torture yourself with that little moron? Here’s a suggestion - GET OUT MORE. Use your sooperspeshul wolfie powers to go to Seattle or Portland or Alaska and MEET SOME REAL WOMEN. Stop stalking the insane vamphag.Rosalie? You’re mind-boogleingly beautiful. Like, our puny human minds cannot wrap around it. I get it. Now GET OVER YOURSELF. As I read your little expositional story to Bella, in which I’m supposed to feel all sorry for you for being all sparkly against your will, I felt nothing but all punchy. Poor Rose. She’s never been taken seriously cuz she’s so purty. And she’s not at all above reminding us how purty she is.If only she could have been plain & ugly like her friend and have babies. And she cannot believe that Edward would pass on her and choose ordinary old Bella.I almost can’t wait till my daughter’s old enough to read this crap. So I can totally point out the flaws, get completely snarktastic about it and pound into her head that THIS IS NOT TWU WUV - IT’S OBSESSIVE INSANITY. No wonder so many teenage girls get involved in abusive relationships - they’re taught that obsessive, stalker behavior means that he really, really loves you. NO IT DOESN’T. Buy The Gift of Fear.

On Bella's first day of school, you realize she gets some personality traits from her father. You know, pale, socially awkward. But she gets taken in anyway, and makes some new friends Jessica and Angela (there are others but those are the girls). While at lunch, this is when she first gets a glimpse of the elusive Cullen family. Gorgeous, pale, seemingly perfect and totally aloof from the rest of the student body. Immediately Bella locks onto Edward.“That’s Edward. He’s gorgeous, of course, but don’t waste your time. He doesn’t date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enough for him. ” She sniffed(Jessica). But she does, and eventually him and Bella get together, at the annoyance of Edward's whole entire family.

144,2308057641,06/29/2018,5.0,"Twilight is the story of Edward and Bella’s romance. Forget any vampire romance you have read before, Twilight is so unique it is almost like it’s in its own genre. The book is marketed at Young Adult readers but it has the ability to cross age barriers and will satisfy both teenagers and adults alike.The story is told in first person from the perspective of Bella, so the reader only ever know what she knows, making Edward and his family a mystery that is slowly unravelled through out the book. Even by the end of the book I was still thirsting for more of the Cullen family back story - hopefully their characters might be developed further in future books. Bella herself is a well written and realistic character, shy and lacking in confidence, her sarcastic inner voice narrates the story for the reader.Twilight is simply and yet beautifully written. The descriptions of Forks leave you feeling like you can almost smell the damp air and hear the rain falling on the roof. The romance between Edward and Bella is both touching and compelling. There is a melancholic feel to their impossible love, yet at the same time they both are unwilling to give up hope that their relationship is not doomed. The book reaches a fever pitch of excitement as the romance between Bella and Edward turns into a frantic race to stay alive. I have heard Twilight described as “a vampire story for people who don’t like vampire stories” and I think I would agree with that. This book really has something for everyone.

The vampires are, as all vampires should be, creepy afThe MehThe writing The BadI almost put this in ‘good’ but because it is per the author’s remarks completely unintentional, an unsettlingly realistic portrayal of a teenager whose parental abuse led to dependence on an abusive boyfriend who neither expects her to take care of him (except, you know, his ego) nor ignores her. Casual sexismThat’s it, that’s all she wrote!If you believed that this is the first review you’ve read of mine.A DISCUSSION.As I mentioned in my previous review, the experience of reading this as an adult is different than reading it as a teenager. As a teenager, I felt similarly to a lot of things I’ve seen floating around: Bella, to me, was an ungrateful brat and undeserving of all the attention heaped on her, and deeply stupid for falling so hard so fast for Edward. How could she not see what he was? I seethed.As an adult, I feel comfortable putting the blame squarely on Bella’s parents’ shoulders (I will elaborate momentarily)Is Bella unpleasant? Yes. But let’s be honest amongst ourselves here: who among us was not unpleasant at seventeen? (apologies to the seventeen year olds reading this, you probably aren’t in the same boat as Bella, but if you are I promise the stupid hormones will pass and eventually you will probably stop hating the world)(no promises on the world being a better place to be, but we’re working on it)Is Bella a brat? Hmm. More complicated.You see, Bella has been handling the money and day-to-day issues of a household, including her mother’s day-to-day, since she can really remember. Apparently things were bad before Bella took over. Bella says that sometimes it’s like her mother is the child and Bella is the parent.That is, first of all, parentification. Bella was expected to be the adult in the household. This is unhealthy and leads to issues with anxiety and abandonment and difficulty with rejection.It is second of all abuse in the form of neglect. Renee does what she wants. Bella picks up after her. But Myth, you say, Bella chose to go to Forks! That wasn’t a case of Renee neglecting Bella! Oh, friend, I reply. It most definitely is.Renee did not have to send Bella to Forks. Renee could have sucked it up and stayed home, having fun with her daughter and providing income. We learn in New Moon that Renee was a kindergarten teacher: why then does she have all this freedom to travel to away games with her small time baseball player husband? Did she quit her job to live on his pay? He’s not even signed yet. Does Renee receive alimony from Charlie? I HAVE QUESTIONS.Most of those questions revolve around Renee’s treatment of Bella (and Charlie’s to a lesser degree. We’ll get there later). How was Bella so convinced that her mother was miserable, not following her new husband around? How is it that Bella is shocked that anyone would take the time to apply snow chains to her truck? Why does Bella not know that her mother is going back to Phoenix? Why are Renee’s first words to her daughter, upon Bella waking up after an unspecified amount of time of unconsciousness in a hospital, that Bella had upset her with her injuries, and moreover that Renee only stayed in the hospital with her because there had been crime in the neighborhood and she was afraid to go home alone?! Why does Bella (an infant when Renee left Charlie and took their daughter with her simply because she couldn’t stand small-town life) know the exact words her mother said when leaving her father? Meanwhile Charlie, while I will admit does appear to love his daughter, had no idea how to properly parent and moreover does not try. He routinely goes fishing rather than hang out with her. I realize she tells him it’s fine, but look. When you want to spend time with your child, and you have the time to do so, you fucking do it. Charlie could have cancelled his trip and gone and rented Bella’s favorite movie for a night in, or gone fishing AND rented Bella’s favorite movie for a night in. He could go grocery shopping with her. He could help fix dinner or do the dishes. He could - gasp - make lunch! (what does he DO with all that fish?!)I’m trying not to go into New Moon here, because I’m a couple of chapters into that, but like. Come on. Everyone believes that all of Bella’s accidents are her own fault for being clumsy? Bella has never had a parent in her life. This is why she is such easy prey for Edward, who is dangerous on a level different than blood-sucking fiend.Of course Bella thinks he’s perfect. He takes care of her. He takes into account what she likes (he doesn’t, they just happen to like the same things, but that’s beside the point). He makes time for her. He always wants to be around her. Never mind that the price for that comes in casual insults, victim blaming, controlling behavior, and literally life-threatening danger (I do not mean the other vampires. Let us never forget that Edward plotted multiple ways to murder Bella and get away with it, and his only concern was that Carlisle might be disappointed or the family might have to move). Never mind that every choice about her body is now Edward’s. (think I’m kidding? Look up the passage just after James gets murderized by Emmett and Jasper. Carlisle literally says, “It’s your choice, Edward.”)Bella then has a panic attack at the idea of Edward breaking up with her, because of course she does. To Bella, he’s the only person who prioritizes her.To sum up: Edward Cullen is an abusive boyfriend, but the way was paved perfectly for him by Bella’s abusive mother and neglectful father. Bella is an abused teen in need of affection and care, and if the only person who seems willing to give it hurts her sometimes or scares her a lot of explicitly threatens her life, what does that matter? He’s the only one who’s ever given a damn.",23,-0.9978,0.157,0.746,0.097,0.5388547697282636,NEGATIVE,0.9972

Yeah, I opened it for the first time in 2020. It was the worst idea I ever had... and the best. Bella is a 17-year-old woman whose only personality trait is that she's clumsy.

151,3249989411,04/10/2020,3.0,"3 stars ⭐Twilight isn’t that bad, y'all are just mean. Yeah, I said it, and you know it’s true. At this point, there are so many videos on Youtube discussing the trend of people hating everything teen girls love so I won't get into it, but Twilight is definitely a victim of that. That being said, is this book an amazing piece of literature? Well, no… but it’s also for sure not the worst book I’ve read looking at you Call Me By Your Name.As I’m sure you all know, Twilight is the story of a girl named Bella Swan who moves to this small town called Forks to go live with her dad. At her new school she is immediately fascinated by this mysterious guy named Edward Cullen who talks to no one but his adoptive siblings. Edward ends up taking an interest in Bella as well and her life is turned upside down when she finds out that Edward is actually a vampire.The plot of this book is inexistent. It’s sad, but true *swipes fake tear*. What I’m guessing is supposed to be the main conflict only really happens at the end of the story and Bella is passed out during it so we only get to read about the aftermath. The rest of the book is Bella and Edward lusting over each other, Bella being a forgettable and bland character and Edward being kinda creepy. Oh, and Jacob shows up once or twice, I think, but he is still so young in this book and does barely nothing, I kinda forgot about him.Bella, like I’ve mentioned, is just very basic and a poor attempt at a relatable teen girl. Edward is… Edward, I guess? He’s what I expected, to be honest, having watched all of the films many times. The dialogue between them is just so awkward and there was like no chemistry.Also, the writing is as if this book was first published on Wattpad. When you think about it, it’s kind of weird that it wasn't. Although it did serve as an inspiration for the masterpiece that is Fifty Shades of Grey, so points for that, I guess?Honestly, yes, Twilight could be better in so many ways, but I didn’t hate it.

Wasn't sure I was going to make it to the end of this 498 page book because the beginning started out with a lot of tedious details of daily life. Then I was put off by the irrational moodswings of Edward...So glad I stayed with it because the writing picked up, the character build-up brought the characters to life, there was ""edge of seat"" suspense, and the book took a mind of its own.The book focuses on Bella and her thoughts. I would like to have read the thoughts of Edward a time or two--especially in the beginning when Edward was friendly one day and openly hostile the next. But, he does explain himself very well as the book progresses...The last half of the book was the saving grace point for me; I could not put it down. The author completely dispelled the myth of the vampire by allowing them to walk in sunlight, kill whatever they eat, lead nomadic existence (mostly), etc. Interesting. The romance between Edward and Bella was nice. Eluded to the possibilities of furthering their affection(s), but never went beyond kissing in this one. Parents FYI. Rated PG-13I'm curious to all the polls I continue seeing as to which male character Bella should have ended up with. Huh? There was never a decision to make.

155,111194906,07/11/2010,1.0,"12 December: So, the night vampires forgot to take my blood last night, but it turns out there's a fucking day one who took about half an hour to find a place to stab me correctly and I'm really feeling like I am five years old again.The last time I was in hospital I was five, and an hour or so away from death from a burst appendix. I had to stay in hospital for quite a while and I must confess being stabbed all the time made me cry a lot.And just now as I'm writing this I find that I might as well be five again. Grown up and crying because people stick things in you. I could be braver than that.And it is probably my fault. I only know how to say 'merci beaucoup' and 'tres bien', one or other of which I use whenever anybody speaks to me in here. Maybe they think I like having my blood slowly leeched from me each day. Maybe if I learned French for fuck off and leave me alone, they'd stop. -----------------------11 December: I take back every disbelieving thing I might ever have thought about Count Yorga. I'm trapped in Europe, practically in Transylvania, and they keep coming in the middle of the night and taking blood. They are relentless, they don't care that you are covered in bruises and don't have any veins left. Many different ones come, so you think it is going to be somebody nice, but it turns out to be a vampire.Please. I'm in the Geneva University Hospital, which is a perfect cover for them. It's horrible and if somebody could please get me out of here. If they tell you I'm sick, don't believe them, they just mean I've still got a bit of blood left. HEELLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!--------------------------Thank you for coming to look at my Twilight review which starts here and goes like this.So I have this boyfriend and we are both in love with each other, and we did go to bed when I was 16 and he was 18, (thanks, my ‘friend’ Mandy for telling everybody) but we totally didn’t go all the way despite what you might hear from certain exfriends people. No. We waited exactly like Mrs Meyer would have wanted. And when we finally did do it properly, it was really really nice and definitely worth waiting for – honestly, I can say it for a fact. And no, I’m not a Seventh Da Jesuit. It is true that maybe this was a special case and it wouldn’t necessarily have been worth waiting for, I can’t say for sure, obviously, it could just be luck.Anyway, so we love each other and when we are together it’s better than anything in the world, it’s better than seeing all the Twilight movies in a row; it’s better than if you could have sex with Edward. But we aren’t together very often at the moment which sucks, though it isn’t totally the problem. What is the problem which does totally suck is that if I’m not there, it’s practically like I don’t exist at all. He’ll refuse to talk to me at nights and weekends and sometimes, like right now, for a week or two at a time. I’ll like beg him not to do this – like we don’t have skype and sms and mobile phones and emails and stuff – it’s like does he think I’m pondscum or something because that’s how he makes me feel. I haven’t read Twilight so I don’t know if there is a particular instance of this, but I imagine things like that happen and I want to know what to do. I only want constructive suggestions. Don’t say dump him, because we love each other. Don’t say cut off his dick. Apart from how rude that is, his penis (which is the word I would prefer to use) is totally his best bit and I particularly love it. And especially don’t say he is a weird undead thing who is only living between 9-5 Monday-Friday except when he actually sees me and then I have this magic counter-effect, because that’s what he said when I was complaining about him never talking to me and although I did believe it to begin with, I no longer think it is true since he accidentally told me he’d been to see a movie and I’m like so when was that…. Not that I know why he would make up such a story. I hope I’m not making him sound horrible, because he is only horrible at nights and weekends and those weeks he won’t talk to me. The rest of the time he is definitely not horrible.Anyway, I would especially like to make the point that I can hardly even eat. When my friends go down to MacDonalds and I used to have a Big Mac with the lot and extra large fries and a shake and an apple pie, now it’s all I can do to order a Quarterpounder with a small fries and they offer me a free upsize because I’m such a good customer and they want to cheer me up and I have to ask them sadly if they’d mind if my friends had it instead; that’s my friends who say I’m practically skin and bones but I can tell they are jealous and wish they had a tragic affair of the heart that would make them sad too, but they have no idea how awful it is not being able to be happy all the time and if they had half a clue they wouldn’t want to be me at all, though it is true that I get much better sex than they do which I suppose is because my boyfriend is so much more experienced than theirs which is because although we waited, he didn’t and so he found out quite a lot that came in very handy when we stopped waiting and if I could just mention at this juncture, Proust in case you haven’t noticed by now and you are reading this, you don’t have to be a posh French writer to make long sentences, just an plain ordinary writer such as I, me, myself (check this) who gets ‘Bs’ for essays all the time can make a perfectly good fairly long sentence and in fact this is by no means my longest sentence ever. I should also point out that it isn’t hard, anybody can do it, in fact Manny did it for his Proust review, although he did it to be clever, whereas it is just natural for me.Anyway, if you have any suggestions as to what I should say to my boyfriend, or how to make him behave better, I’d really like to hear.Thank you for reading my Twilight review which I hope you like.",21,0.9982,0.108,0.72,0.173,0.5507393680742737,NEGATIVE,0.9999
156,34201675,09/30/2008,5.0,"When these books first came out, I noticed them everywhere, but did not know anything about them nor have a desire to read them. My DH kept commenting about how cool the covers looked. Finally, my group of book blogging friends were getting into them, so I was hearing more about them. Then the debates started. As always when a general market book hits my ""Christian"" blogging friends there are skeptics. There are people like me who just look for quality fiction and it can be Christian Market or General and it doesn't matter where it came from as long as it is ""quality"". A comparison to the craze that this saga has caused, especially with the movie hitting Hollywood this month is to Harry Potter. I did not get on the HP bus until after the first movie and third book were published, but now I'm a die-hard fan. There are the ""Christians"" out there that are completely of the mind that HP is evil and it supports witchcraft and the Bible says that's evil, so I won't read it. etc etc. Well, I thoroughly ended the HP series, and realize that it is first and foremost Fiction. I get my theology from my Bible, not from fiction books, end of story. When it came to reading this series, I was hearing the debates... ""It's about vampires."" ""It's evil, and God does not want me exposed to that evil."" ""The Bible is against it."" So, I had not read them. I did not know anything more than what I heard, and just was fairly ambivalent to the entire situation. Then, DH was in the grocery store check out line and called me to check to make sure he got everything on the list and then some. During normal marital grocery store conversation, he said ""Oh, hey, you know those books that everyone is so crazy about? They're on sale here at the checkout line. It's two hardback, two paperback. You want them?"" (For those of you who do not know me, I'm a book-junkie. I love books. The problem is books are expensive, therefore, I only buy books that I'm crazy about reading. Since my wallet has become attached to my DH's income, book spending has decreasing exponentially, as books are not of dire importance to my sweet DH. Therefore, if DH wants to buy me books, I do not care what it is. BUY IT!!!!) Thus, my interest was fully peaked and I was prepared to read! Our move was started, and most things were packed, and now I have this pile of books to read. I was excited. So when there were lulls in packing and unpacked I was enveloped into the narrative world of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight... Oh my goodness! I had no idea what I was missing! To my understanding, this is a teen saga (four books in a series). It's a romance, it's a suspense, and it's about vampires. Through all of the debates that I read. One topic was on whether or not as a parent you should allow your teen to read these books. Well, they are meant for teens, which should mean sure they'd be okay. But today that is not always the case, so my best advice and pre-read opinion was to read the book first and discuss it with your teen if necessary, or to read it in cue and the same, discussion, etc. The best comment that I read from someone who had read the series was how to first realize that it is fiction, and not something to ""change your theology about"". And then, she went on to highlight her opinion that the book was about abstinence as a main theme, and how can there be something harmful in that! She said that the book is about a vampire boyfriend who desires his human girlfriend in a vampire thirst and how he works to abstain from hurting her and going about what is best for both of them. Imagine! So, with this thought in my head, as well as all of the people screaming, burn the books, I jumped in to read. Wow. Stephenie Meyer is a new favorite author for me. I am just plain ecstatic that I already have the rest of the saga to read, because if I did not, I would be on my way to the store to buy them immediately, before they are sold out! Call it a teen read, I do not care. I would say that it is an everyone read, but that definitely a teen could read it (safely) and love it. This is another one of those books that pulls you into their world and takes you on an adventure ride of love, friendship, family, jealousy, fear, and chills. It is a fact that a main theme through out is to live by what is right and not by what you simply and ultimately desire. There is a path for life and even though you may change it at your will, your efforts may cause more harm than good if you follow yourself instead of what is true and just. As a reader, I was fully enraptured in the day to day life of Bella and her emotions for Edward. I cannot wait to read the rest of the saga and I cannot wait to see the film! I do hope that it does it justice. Bella is an average teen. Going between parents in two states, and being a klutz prone to humiliation, she just rides on the sidelines of life with her good grades and normal behavior. Her story is one that any romantic girl who has loved or desires to love can fall into and be held to the pages as the story unfolds. I recommend this book for anyone and everyone. It truly is a keeper for my shelf. Put into the realm of the supernatural, this story portrays all that is dear and near as any Romeo and Juliet story in a different atmosphere can. There will always be two people that by appearances should not be together. It is in the making it work and love enduring that proves that there is a way for anything to happen when you follow what is good and not evil.

157,518120814,01/26/2013,1.0,"I once wrote an review on deviantart.com (http://vampirekiki.deviantart.com/art...) but I don't feel like re-posting the review up here again, so I write a new review here instead.Please note that I watched the Twilight movie before I read the book, and actually think the movie is better than the book. Plus it has been a long time since I read Twilight (a translated version) for the first and last time. I write the following review with my memory as the only reference.Important Note: the word ""vampire"" is being used VERY loosely in that review, not that I actually acknowledge sparking disco balls are qualified to be called vampires. Twilight is a simple enough story. Girl moves to a small town and meets a boy who turns out to be vampire, then hardly anything happens in the middle of the book until at the ending part all of a sudden three random 'bad' vampires show up, wanting to hurt the girl. But those bad vampires are eventually driven out of town, the end.The creator of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer is a first-timer author, and it shows quite obviously. Her characters and plots always seem juvenile and hopelessly flat to me, her novel as a whole reminds me strongly of some badly written fanfictions I've come across on the internet---it even reminds me of myself writing fanfic for the first time. These are by no mean good news.I must admit I'm not a fan for romances and that may partly explain why I have problem with Twilight. But oh goodness, I had read quite a number of far better written, more meaningful romances than Twilight. S.Meyer didn't offer us anything new or refreshing.We are told that Bella and Edward are in love, but strangely enough they don't seem to share interest in common, I never see them doing stuff together or enjoying each other's company. All I got is a lot of Bella and Edward staring at each other, a lot of ""I LOVE YOU!"" ""NO I LOVE YOU MORE!"" ""YOU SMELL SO GOOD!"" ""YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFULLLLL!!!"", plus Bella's LONG description on Edward's physical beauty. It doesn't look like a meaningful relationship to me.If I chose to view Twilight as a vampire novel, then I'd be in even more trouble. The so-called vampires in the novel freaking sparkle under the sun. What in the world, is that!?From time to time I wonder, did S.Meyer mistake vampires with immortals when she penned Twilight? Or did she want her male lead to be pretty, better-than-human and an immortal, so much that she picked up the idea of vampire and then stripped it of most of the offensive trapping that comes with the traditional vampire-package: the blood-drinking, the killing, the fear of cross and sunlight, cruelty, etc; so she just downplayed those 'darkside', leaving her 'vampires' hardly anything more than some lame, pretty, rich, immortal shells. As many, many people had already pointed out, the main character of the book, Bella Swan, has hardly any personality (I only learnt that Bella loves to complain and rant and she has no interest outside of her boyfriend, after reading the whole book) she is an empty shell for readers to insert themselves into. As to Edward Cullen, at first he's rude to Bella, acts like he doesn't want to have anything to do with her, then he goes watching her while she slept, without consent. Oh, what a creeper.Not only this, then Edward quite freely admits he has an uncontrollable urge to kill Bella, but it still isn't scary enough for her to run for her life? Is that girl too stupid to live or something? We are also told that Edward is an 100-plus years old vampire, he is supposed to have a 'dark past', which we know nothing of (Tell, not show. Bad.). But no, from start to end he acts like a 17 years old teenager. We're also supposed to believe Edward loves Bella because he can't read her mind. Give me a break! An 100 years old immortal needs mind-reading skill to figure out what is in a 17 years old girl's mind? You're joking, right? I think the bare-bone idea of Twilight (vampire meets girl, romance etc) is a workable one, it can be written into a descent enough novel with 200 or so pages if only it were written by a pair of more skillful hands, but sadly it isn't the case.",21,0.9417,0.14,0.707,0.153,0.4951989102851172,NEGATIVE,0.9908

And I'm glad she is because so many people bitch about her. She had her issues, but I related to her sense of being an old soul, or never really fitting in anywhere as I have always been ""popular"" enough, but never really fit into one group in my life. In her own words: “I didn’t relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn’t relate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain.”There was an overload of ""love"" and ""eye-gazing"", but Jesus tits, doesn't anyone remember being a teenager. That's what that shit is. Love and eye-gazing.

All in all, an enjoyable read, although trying at times. I would actually love to continue at some point and see how she progresses as an author. We get it Stephen King, not everyone can be you, but you don't have to shit on those that aren't. I actually really get pissed when everyone is taking about suicide awareness and not tagging authors in negative reviews and how we should all take care of each other, but then because it's so popular to do so, it's okay to shit on Stephenie Meyer publically. Why, because she made a bunch of money? Because you're a lemming and it's cool to do it? It's okay to not like something, but the negative reaction to this series is definitely in some part herd mentality. I will continue with the series at some point.

168,88423270,02/06/2010,1.0,"In 2009, I was naive to the world of YA. In middle school, I read Eragon, The Chocolate War, and Catcher in the Rye. Beyond that, I focused on Adult science-fiction (Octavia Butler and Ray Bradbury), Adult fantasy (Tolkien and Zelazny), Adult horror (Stephen King), and the occasional chick-lit novel (The Devil Wears Prada and something by Janet Evanovich, which I never finished). The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Thirteen Reasons Why were my first forays into modern YA. I loved them both. After that, I decided to give this much mocked genre a try. I did a Google search for ""best YA books"" or something to that extent. Then I clicked on one of the first results. It was a question on Yahoo answers. Almost everyone recommended Twilight. I'd never heard of it. Keep this in mind -- I was homeschooled and, therefore, sheltered from popular fads. At that time, I lived in Luxor, Egypt. Have you ever tried to find a library in a third world country? A country whose first language is not English? It's hard, to say the least. And there were no bookstores, outside of tourist traps, which sold postcards and travel guides. But I found a copy because, after all, this was Twilight. My expectations shot through the roof when I saw the cover. Imagine my surprise when I closed the book one minute later. I couldn't get into it. One week later, I opened it and turned to the last page. There was a passage with Edward kissing Bella's neck. I closed it again. Something was wrong with me. Twilight was the most popular YA book and I didn't like it. I didn't know of its reputation as one of the worst books ever written. I didn't come into the book looking for something to hate. For the record, I've never done that. Whenever I start a book I know I won't like, I never finish it because it's a bad book. I don't have the patience to read bad books. Nor do I have the time. I've started A Game of Thrones three times and not once have I made it past chapter one. To be honest, I've never finished Twilight. I can't bear to drag myself across the finish line. I don't think I've ever read past the point where Bella flirts with Jacob. And here's the thing -- it's not the worst book I've ever read. It's just incredibly boring. And it's my least favorite book in the series. Now that I’ve explored the YA genre, I realize that Bella isn’t the worst heroine in existence. I don’t like her and I don’t understand why people enjoy reading from her perspective, but I’m able to tolerate her. Her POV is simple, if not amusing, and she’s incredibly selfish. Everything revolves around Bella. No, this isn’t atypical of the average teenager. If you’re as self-absorbed as Bella, chances are, you’re a sociopath. Never have I ever met a person like her, unless we’re referring to family members of mine with less than stellar reputations. Unless a person is absolutely beautiful, they aren’t worth her time. And people say she’s just like the average teen. That’s incredibly insulting. She treats her father like a child and acts as if she raised herself, which, considering her attitude to humans, isn’t all that hard to believe – who’d want to stick around to raise a shallow, selfish child who somehow manages to judge everything and everyone?And Bella isn’t meant to be an unlikable character. Quite the opposite. We, the audience, are supposed to like, and even root for her. I don’t know what her goal is, outside of dating Edward, but I’m certainly not going to root for her. She’s rude to her human friends, rude to her mother, and to top it off, she’s rude to the human boys who find her attractive. Bella isn’t personality-less, quite the opposite. She thinks she can take advantage of everyone around her to achieve her shallow goal. For whatever reason, she flirts with Jacob to get information out of him. She doesn’t even try to care about her friends – Jessica and Angela – and as for Mike, Tyler, and Eric? They’re only there to prove that Bella really is beautiful, despite her protests. When the vampires appear, Bella is instantly drawn to them, despite Jessica’s warning. I don’t know about you, but whenever a nice, well meaning girl tells me to stay away from a group of pale kids with black marks around their eyes, I follow her advice.Bella becomes obsessed with Edward for no reason outside of his physical appearance. This, I don’t mind. I know people are prone to fall in lust, but a relationship can’t exist on it alone. There must be something more. What hobby do they share? What activities do they perform together? What common interests do they have? Does he make her laugh? Does she make him laugh? Do they engage in intelligent conversation? No. I didn’t expect Twilight to be great literature, but at the very least, I wanted to be entertained.As for Edward, he fails as a love interest. He reminded me of a creepy, overprotective father. I don’t find fathers sexy, so I’m under the impression that Bella has an Electra complex. It fits with her upbringing. She denies her own father and insists on having a sexual relationship with a vampire who could kill her at any moment.I don’t know why Edward likes Bella, outside of her scent. It would be pointless to explain his overbearing, borderline-psychopathic behavior. While I understand that he’s a vampire, his behavior is glorified. Regardless of his species, I don’t tolerate that from anyone. As for the supporting cast, they were all so thinly outlined, I can’t bring myself to care. I liked Jacob Black. That was it. I can’t name more than two character traits for any of the supporting characters, and that right there is a problem. Sure, this is an epic romance between Bella and Edward, but that’s no excuse to write poorly fleshed out characters without an inkling of personality outside of jealous, perky, fatherly, motherly, brotherly, depressed, and talkative. If it weren’t for the main characters, Twilight could get two stars. Sadly, it isn’t well written either. Whoever wrote, represented, and edited this book doesn’t know how to use a thesaurus. So many synonyms are incorrectly used in this book, it would take too much time to point them out. In addition, the prose was littered with unneeded description. That’s called purple prose. It’s when a writer waxes poetic for an unnecessary length of time about something that has nothing to do with the plot. I didn’t even want to mention the plot – or lack of a plot. I expect a commercial novel to follow a series of beats and keep me entertained. For the first one hundred pages, Bella does a series of mundane things that make even the worst Sweet Valley High book look like quality literature. The villains aren’t introduced until the third act and I’m unsure of the point of this novel. What is the theme? Two teenagers can fall in love despite unfortunate circumstances? I can’t even say I understand why people were able to finish this book. I enjoyed parts of New Moon and Eclipse, and I liked Breaking Dawn, despite the third part. I can’t find anything positive to say about Twilight. Honestly, I don’t know why I bothered finishing the series. It must’ve been because of Jacob. And we know how that turns out. As for the plot holes, science fails, and illogical inconsistencies? Well, it would take several essays to explain those. All I will say is this – whoever edited this book knows nothing about biology, history, economics, or anything related to the real world. I imagine that they live in a bubble, shielded from reality.And yes, I know Twilight is little more than teenybopper entertainment, but that’s no excuse for writing a story devoid of character development, scientific research, decent prose, and a functioning plot. Commercial doesn’t mean first draft sent in by a first time writer right out of college. I expect a certain level of quality when I purchase a book. Sadly, as with movies, publishers and studios realize that the majority of their audience will settle for this. ",20,0.9963,0.099,0.761,0.14,0.484080552856063,NEGATIVE,1.0

171,4175851659,08/23/2021,2.0,"HEY HEY HEY IM POSTING THIS REVEIW BC I HAD TO WRITE THIS FOR SCHOOL AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL POST IT >:D Why Twilight, Ultimately, and Entirely, Sucks by V. Oh Twilight. Where do I even start? What a monstrosity of a book, I ain’t lying when I tell you I could feel my brain cells shrivel up and die while reading this book. What the author, Stephenie Meyer, tried to pass off as a good novel ended up being an absolute dumpster fire. Reading Twilight felt like what I imagine drinking paint thinner feels like. Pain. Now as much as I detest Twilight, I must admit that there are quite a few books out there that are significantly worse. In my opinion, Twilight gets a bit too much hate then it deserves. Emphasis on “a bit”.Also keep in mind that when I say Twilight, I mean the first book in the Twilight Saga. If I was discussing the Twilight Saga as a whole, I would say there isn’t enough hate for it as it just gets progressively worse and more problematic throughout the series. Now with all that being said I still firmly believe the first book, simply labeled Twilight, is still complete and utter trash. 10/10 would definitely recommend never to read it. If you ever come across a copy I beg of you to dispose of it and do the world a favor. This thing, which is not worthy of the lovely title “book”, is not only problematic but entirely unappealing to read. Twilight is so problematic, I am absolutely disgusted by it. For the sake of this paper, I shall only be listing a few things because if I named them all this would be far too long. For one thing, Stephenie Meyer’s immense romanticization of toxic and emotionally abusive relationships. Edward Cullen the vampire (the main love interest) is portrayed as this perfect prince charming when in reality he’s a stalker, creep, and emotionally abusive to Bella. Edward literally breaks into Bella's house to watch her sleep and it’s supposed to be romantic?? Maybe when hell turns cold. He’s also extremely controlling of Bella, not letting her hang out with her friends just because he doesn’t like them, not letting her go places, and basically keeping her captive, but it’s only for “her safety” of course. Also, is everyone going to ignore the fact that Edward is a 104 year old man who seduces Bella, a 17 year old girl, aka a minor. Clearly there is nothing wrong going on. Edward is what we call a walking red flag.Now onto the main character, Bella Swan. Oh lord help, help, help. The only reason Edward can’t read her mind (that’s his special vampire ability) is because she doesn’t have a brain. I’ve come across many stupid YA protagonists in my day but none as bad as Bella. She is the definition of the stereotypical YA “Not Like Other Girls™️” trope and it is simply abominable. Bella Swan is probably the worst portrayal of a teenage girl I have ever witnessed. Her life revolves and depends on men, and she brings the term “boy crazy” to a whole other level. Bella amplifies the disgusting stereotype that women need men to be happy. She literally cannot function when Edward isn’t around, and I believe this is partly because of Edward’s emotional manipulation. Bella completely relies on Edward for her wellbeing and happiness which, obviously, isn’t healthy. Not only is Bella one of the most toxic portrayals of teenage girls, but she’s just all together a horrible character as far as how she was written. She has the personality of a piece of sliced white bread. Her one personality trait is that she reads Jane Austen, if you can even call that a personality trait. She’s a bland crust of bread. And that’s literally it. I hate how apparently everyone is in love with her because she’s so “different” and “not like other girls” when she’s actually the most generic person out there. The writing style of this book is also unbearably bland, boring, and just all around dull. The writing doesn’t flow whatsoever, it just states the things that happened almost like a list in a once and a while something of interest comes up. It is truly a trash masterpiece.So to sum this all up, please don’t read this abomination or your brain cells will shrivel up and perish just as Iron-Man did.

 “And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.”

First re-read after ten years or so. I am still liking it, just a little bit less than when I was teenager. There's a lot of things I usually hate in books (e.g. insta-love, not so clever heroine, soulmates trope) but I didn't mind them here. Maybe because of nostalgia?I just wish I never watched the movies because they ruined this book series for me.",20,-0.3675,0.134,0.764,0.102,0.4619047619047619,NEGATIVE,0.9569
173,35627038,10/18/2008,1.0,"Not being a teenage girl, I'm clearly not the intended audience for ""Twilight."" The only reason I read Stephenie Meyer's novel is it was the selection of a book group I'm in -- a book club that's all women except for me. (That may help explain why it was chosen.) The club met last night, and while the members were all critical of the book's clunky writing and no one much cared for its main character, Bella, they mostly found the book and its sequels -- they read them; I didn't -- to be trashy and fun. Even if they hadn't, though, there's no way they could've hated ""Twilight"" as much as I did.It's tempting to overanalyze ""Twilight."" While the book itself is hardly deserving of any analysis, the fact that it's become a huge bestseller makes one want to figure out why so many people are drawn to it. My best guess is that ""Twilight"" does the same thing for 14-year-old girls that romance books do for adult women: it serves as unchallenging wish-fulfillment.The target audience for ""Twilight"" likely has no problem identfying with Bella. Like them, she's a teenage girl who considers herself awkward and unremarkable, and whose primary passion is reading books. Just as ""Twilight""'s readers would like to do, Bella falls for a mysterious, worldly, older man who is muscular and handsome. He, in turn, is completely infatuated with her, protects her from dangerous situations, magically appears whenever she wants him there, and, finally -- this being the most important part for young readers attracted to romance but perhaps scared of the physical aspect -- doesn't want to have sex with her. (This last part must make ""Twilight"" easier for readers' parents too.)And the wish-fulfillment for the average reader isn't limited to Bella's relationship with Edward. It stretches to all parts of her life. Bella is so smart she doesn't have to study much to do well in school. Her parents are loving but remain largely in the background, freeing her to go wherever and do whatever she wants. And it's not just Edward who's interested in Bella; almost every other boy in her grade vies for her attention too.It's tempting, then, to conclude that Stephenie Meyer, rather than writing a book she honestly hoped would be good, instead developed a franchise intended to cynically cash in on girls' insecurities and misguided desires as anything on the CW or in a teen beauty magazine does. Is there even one button of a typical 14-year-old female reader that Meyer doesn't push?And I haven't even discussed how terrible the writing in ""Twilight"" is. Ms. Meyer, if you've written dialogue meant to be sarcastic, you don't need to use the phrase ""I said sarcastically."" By doing so, you're either admitting your dialogue isn't clear enough to be understandable on its own, or you're simply calling your readers stupid. In fact, kill ninety percent of your adverbs, and please just use ""said"" instead of ""replied,"" ""retorted"" and every other synonym in your thesaurus. You're already injuring readers enough with your half-baked story and uninteresting characters that you don't have to add the insult of writing so poorly too.",20,0.9556,0.084,0.787,0.129,0.5195436507936508,NEGATIVE,0.9944

Not only have I heard alot of...negative...things about this series, I also saw half of the first film once and all I can remember was that it was incredibly cringeworthy. The actual content of the movie was also very difficult for me to remember.However, I must say it was so much better than I had anticipated!Although I'm really not into all of that romantic ""mysterious boy falls inlove with out-of-place girl"" kinda stiff, I cannot disagree with the fact that at times, it could be incredibly romantic and very hard not to have a tinie, tiny (major) crush on Edward. Something that was supposed to be, as I heard, bad about it was the writing. But I was thouroughly surprised, because it was actually very well written. Yeah okay, it wasn't perfect but it was pretty good!But. Yes there is a but, there is always a but. The relantionship between Edward and Bella was SO problematic and just...wrong. And not because they are different species, it's BECAUSE Edward had so much fucking power and influence over Bella! Why? Why I wondered. I'll tell you why:It's because Bella, Isabella fucking Swan is such a drip and such naive little person. That's not to say I don't like, because I do. I think she is a likeable character and very realistic, but come on Bella? I mean when someone is standing outside your window every night watching you sleep, that ain't romantic anymore, that's your cue to run! And why does he get to boss you around so much? Whatever happend to being a strong independant woman?
