2,168850328,05/17/2011,4.0,"I was extremely surprised by this book. Let me tell you why (it's a funny story): On the Danish cover it says ""Pi's Liv"" (Pi's Life), but I hadn't noticed the apostrophe, so I thought it said ""Pis Liv"" (Piss Life) and I thought that was an interesting title at least, so perhaps I should give it a go. So I did. And... what I read was not at all what I had expected (I thought it was a book about a boy growing up amidst poverty and homelessness). It wasn't until I looked up the book in English I realized the title wasn't ""Piss Life"". I was deceived for longer than I like to admit and, well, not only about this. When I first read it I also thought it was based on a true story. I'm not sure why I thought this, I must have misread something (I vaguely recall thinking the prologue was instead an introduction). It was a sad (and ehm, slightly humiliating) day when I discovered the truth lay elsewhere. I guess your romantic beliefs must die someday, and that was the day for me.See, it's easier to believe in the world and be optimistic about it, when you also believe that world capable of containing a boy and a tiger co-existing on a lifeboat for 7 months and surviving. The truth is this book probably changed my life, not in any grand, extraordinary way. But with the small things, the small observations. Like how Pi was afraid to run out of paper, to document his days in the lifeboat, and instead he ran out of ink. Like how he chose to embrace three religions, not just one. This book, and Pi especially, represent and embody a way of life that I admire. It's not about believing in God, but about what it takes to believe in something, anything really. Yourself, the world, goodness, life, God. If it seemed real enough for me to believe it had happened, perhaps the real world is indeed a place where it could happen.

But are they worth it?Click the link for my video review of the big bois in my life.The Written Review:The beginning is rough.It's all like - Why do we keep going on and on about religion? Where's the boat? Where's the tiger? Stop and enjoy the roses.  The book will get to the tiger part when it wants to. Young Pi ( Piscine ""Pi"" Patel ) spends the first part of the book joining the Christian, Muslim and Hindu faiths. It's not a matter of he can't choose a religion - it's that he is able simultaneously believe in all of them. The philosophical musings and religious prose provide an extremely interesting insight on how these religions intersect:
If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' then surely we are also permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.
 And then...you get to the tiger part!Pi Patel's life quickly shifts from one of religious philosophy and animal care (at his family's zoo) to one of great uncertainty. His family is closing their Indian zoo and they need to travel by boat to a new county. Whatever animals they couldn't sell or trade are on the ship.Only, something goes wrong. Very. Wrong.The ship is capsizing and it looks like neither human nor animal will make it out alive. Soon, Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a menagerie of animals and within an adventure he will surely never forget. 
Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart.
Note: (view spoiler)[Was I the only one who was upset with the ending? I was so mad that we were given the two scenarios at the end of the story. It was like the rug was being pulled out from under me. According to Pi, either we are to believe the tiger adventure happened or it was the alternate version: cannibalism and watching his family die in the boat. I felt cheated and turned what was a huge triumphant moment into a truly giant downer.

6,27191630,07/14/2008,4.0,"Life of Pi was a fairly engaging story in terms of plot and character, but what made it such a memorable book, for me at least, was its thematic concerns. Is it a ""story that will make you believe in God,"" as Pi claims? I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I would recommend it to people who enjoy thinking about the nature of reality and the role of faith in our lives. To me, the entire thrust of the book is the idea that reality is a story, and therefore we can choose our own story (as the author himself puts it). So if life is a story, we have two basic choices: we can limit ourselves only to what we can know for sure - that is, to ""dry, yeastless factuality"" - or we can choose ""the better story."" I suppose in Pi's world the ""better story"" includes God, but he doesn't say this is the only meaningful possibility. In fact, Pi calls atheists his ""brothers and sisters of a different faith,"" because, like Pi, atheists ""go as far as the legs of reason will carry them - and then they leap."" Pi's point, in my opinion, is that human experience always involves interpretation, that our knowledge is necessarily limited, that both religious belief and atheism require a leap of faith of one kind or another - after all, there's so little we can know for sure. For Pi, then, we shouldn't limit ourselves only to beliefs that can be proven empirically. Instead, we should make choices that bring meaning and richness to our lives; we should exercise faith and strive for ideals (whatever the object of our faith and whatever those ideals might be). Or, as Pi says in taking a shot at agnosticism: ""To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation."" In the end, however, I didn't necessarily read this book as an invitation to believe in God. Instead, I saw it as a mirror held up to the reader, a test to see what kind of worldview the reader holds. That is, as Pi himself says, since ""it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with the animals or the story without the animals?"" Or, as I took it: Is it my nature to reach for and believe the better but less likely story? Or do I tend to believe the more likely but less lovely story? What view of reality do I generally hold? Another equally important question is this: How did I come by my view of reality? Do I view the world primarily through the lens of reason? Or do I view it through the lens of emotion? For Pi, I think it's safe to say his belief comes by way of emotion. He has, as one reviewer noted, a certain skepticism about reason (in fact, Pi calls it ""fool's gold for the bright""). Pi also has what I would call a subtle but real basis for his belief in God, namely, ""an intellect confounded yet a trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose."" But belief still isn't easy for him. Despite his trusting sense of purpose, Pi acknowledges that ""Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer."" So it's not that a life of faith is easier, in Pi's opinion, it's that for him belief is ultimately more worthwhile. This is not to say, however, that Pi holds a thoroughly postmodern view of God or that he believes as a matter of art rather than in a sincere way. True, Pi suggests that whether you believe his story had a tiger in it is also a reflection of your ability to believe in something higher. And of course it's easy to read Pi's entire story as an attempt to put an acceptable gloss on a horrific experience. Still, there are a number of clues throughout the book that give the reader at least some reason to believe Pi's story did have a tiger in it (for instance, the floating banana and the meerkat bones).As such, Pi's two stories could be seen as an acknowledgement that both atheism and belief in God require some faith, and therefore it's up to each of us to choose the way of life that makes us the happiest. He's not necessarily saying that the truth is what you make it, he's saying we don't have unadulterated access to the truth: our imagination, personalities, and experiences unavoidably influence the way we interact with the world. But that's not the same as saying whatever we imagine is true. I think Pi, for instance, knows which of his stories is true. It's not Pi but the reader who is left with uncertainty and who therefore has to throw her hands up and say ""I don't know,"" or else choose one story or the other. And to me, this isn't too far off from the predicament we all find ourselves in. And that's what makes Life of Pi such a challenge to the reader: Pi's first story is fantastic, wonderful, but hard to believe. Yet there's some evidence that it happened just the way he said it did. And Pi's second story is brutal, terrible, but much easier to accept as true. Yet it's not entirely plausible either, and it leaves no room for the meerkat bones or Pi's ""trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose."" If the reader personally dismisses the tiger story out of hand, I suppose that's another way of saying the reader, by nature, tends to believe the more likely but less lovely story. In the same way, if the reader gets to the story's payoff and still believes there was a tiger in the boat, the reader is probably inclined to believe the more emotionally satisfying story. But it should be born in mind that Pi doesn't definitively state which story was true, something which only he can know for sure. All we can really be sure of, in Pi's universe, is that he was stuck on a lifeboat for a while before making it to shore. So which story do I believe? I struggled with that question for a long time. But after thinking about it for a couple of days, I'll end this review with the final lines from the book: ""Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea as Mr. Patel, and none in the company of an adult Bengal Tiger.""

7,7691195,10/13/2007,5.0,"I read this book two years ago, but when we discussed it this month for book club, I remembered how much I liked it. A good discussion always ups my appreciation of a novel as does an ending that makes me requestion my givens in the story. I find myself reading contradictory interpretations and agreeing with both sides. That's the beauty of symbolism: as long as you back up your cause, it's plausible. Initially it took me several weeks to get into the book. The beginning reads more like a textbook with inserted clips of the main character's future self. While the knowledge I gained about zoology and theology was interesting, it wasn't intriguing enough to keep me awake for more than a few pages at a time and often I found the tidbits a confusing distraction. But with distance I enjoyed the backdrop information it offered. If you're struggling through the initial background, jump ahead to the second section. Yeah it's important, but it's not vital. And maybe once you've read the story you'll want to come back and appreciate his analysis.I highly enjoyed this strange journey at sea and found it almost believable--until the castaways encounter the island at which point I wondered how much of his sanity wavered. Being shipwreck is one of a plethora of phobias I have. Throw on top my even stronger fear of tigers and this was a story straight out of a nightmare, one that kept me intrigued for a resolution. How could a boy keep the upper hand shipwrecked with a tiger? I had a picture in my head of Pi clinging to the side of the boat to avoid both the salty water infested with sharks and a foodless boat housing a hungry carnivore.I found myself stuck in the unusual place where as a reader I find a story plausible with full knowledge that had this story been presented in real life I would have doubted its authenticity. I wanted to believe the story and all its fantasy. The end initially annoyed me, but if you look at the rich metaphors in the story, it becomes delectable for a story analyst like me. There is nothing I enjoy more than tearing apart a story and pulling out the intentions and symbols buried inside. Instead of just a fantastical story, you find a fable with a moral.Spoilers here.(view spoiler)[I want to reread the story now and analyze Richard Parker as Pi's alter ego, seeing that alpha and omega struggle as an internal one. Even the name Richard Parker is a hint at cannibalistic roots since it is the true account of a sailor who died at the hands of his cannibalistic crew members. I keep going back to that moment when Pi calls for Richard Parker to join him on the ship and then is appalled at what he has done. Once Richard Parker has joined his voyage, there is no banishing him. If they are one and the same, they beautifully represent that internal battle between the civilized vegetarian and the animalistic instinct to survive, showing the compartmentalization he needed to prevent madness. You would not expect the small boy to conquer the beast (whether animal or himself), and yet he keeps the upper hand for an unimaginable 227 days. Had the cannibal overrun his pysche, he would have lost his battle and landed a madman. When the duo landed on the beaches of Mexico, Richard Parker took off, never to be noted by civilians again, but alive and surviving. Thus the horror of the incident will always live in Pi's memory but he chooses to repress it as it has no part in civilization.I enjoyed the portrayal of the characters on the boat as animals. I could envision the quiet maternal sadness the orangutan gave his mother. Since the crew would be blamed for the demise of the ship, the wounded sailor as the zebra lying as prey to a demented and angry foreign chef who is just as crazy as we view the viscous hyena. The symbols were perfect and I think a second read would bring out their traits even stronger. Some of the richest symbolism comes from the cannibal island and sailor. I think Pi's childlike mind could not deal with the cannibalism of a loved one and lets this theme leak into other story elements. The blind sailor is a second portrayal of the French chef, a character too big and conflicting to fit into one projection. At first he is the mean animal thinking only of his own survival, but as the journey progresses, Pi is conflicted with his friendship for the man. A bond is bound to happen between the only two survivors in limited space and Pi could not come to terms with his human feelings for the barbaric man. So he invents a second character, one whom he can make human, worthy of connection, but in the end is still untrustworthy and Pi must kill or be killed. So what of the strange island? In his hallucinating state, it serves as a mirage where life is not as sweet as he suspected. The island parallels his own problems at sea with rich religious symbolism of the Garden of Eden. No matter what one's ethical code, the will to survive trumps one's moral haven. These vegetarians (person and island) don't want to harm, but are killing to survive. Something happened out at sea that his waning mind (and blindness both real and spiritual) could not substantiate and like all else he twisted it to a socially accepted tale. Since the island is discovered just after the sailor dies, maybe finding one of the chef's tooth on board turned him. Or maybe Pi happened upon a pile of garbage infested with rats and this boy, starving and demented enough to have tried his own waste, sees it as a heaven. His civilized nature knew he should scorn the filth but his barbaric needs were grateful for the nasty feast. The bones in the boat, proof that his experience was real, could have been rat bones. Whatever the cause of his epiphany, he had to enter the depths of his own personal hell to realize this was not a heaven, or Garden of Eden, and a return to civilized behavior was vital for his own survival. Richard Parker was winning as he felt completely detached from civilization. He almost wished to stay and die at sea, to live at a level of base survival, instead of have to emotionally deal with his ordeal to progress. But his innate need to survive wins out as he realizes that as the lone castaway if he does not fight his mind's descent into madness, the sea will eat him mentally and literally. One of my favorite interpretations of the island is a religious fork in the road. Whatever truly happened, the island cements your belief in the first or second account. Either you see the meerkat remains as proof that the beauty of the first story is true or the island is the point at which you start questioning the credence of his tale and believe he threw in this unbelievable turn of events to ready you to accept his alternate ending. As readers we are given the choice between two stories. We can pick the miraculous version of the first story, an icon of those who believe in God, or we can pick the grim atheist view of the pessimistic--although reasonable--second story, as do those who believe science disproofs God. In section one, Pi references religion to not only show where his beliefs give him strength but to give backbone to the religious allegory. He shows disdain for the indecisive agnostic (see quotes below) and bids you chose your path. The island serves to question your own religious devotion, but you have to pick what you think it represents, which story you care to believe. Pi states this is a story that makes you believe in God. As a believer in God and the second story, I don't think there is merely an atheist interpretation to the second. Either you accept God with a leap of faith despite dissenting controversy or you take the bleak realism and see God saved him from death at sea and even more protected him from mental anguish by healing his soul from the horrors he experienced. Both stories can justify the belief in God or justify your belief in nothing. Just as I don't believe people who buy the second story are atheists, I do not believe people who chose the first story follow blindly or idiotically. It's a matter of interpretation. The story isn't going to make you believe or disbelieve God anymore than you now do.At first I was annoyed he recanted his story because I wanted to believe his original story. It is imaginative and well written and I didn't like being called out for believing fantasy from the fantasy itself. But how could I not love an allegorical explanation to a literal story? So now I love that he presents both stories: the imaginative far-fetched one and the plausible horrific one and leaves you the reader to decide which one you want to buy into and let you ponder what it says about you. That is the point of the story.

8,23858991,06/06/2008,1.0,"No need to reinvent the wheel. Here's my Amazon.com review:It doesn't matter whether what you tell people is truth or fiction, because there's no such thing as truth, no real difference between fantasy and reality, so you might as well go with the more interesting story. That's ""Life of Pi"" in a nutshell. Sorry to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet. Remember that season of the TV series ""Dallas"" that turned out to be just a dream? That's kind of how you feel after you've invested hours of your time reading page after page of a quite engrossing survival narrative, only to find out that it was all something the survivor made up. Or was it? Ah, there's the twist that we're supposed to find so clever. But the officials from the ship company who tell Pi they don't believe his story are such hopelessly weak strawmen that the author pretty much forces you to accept the ""better story."" Pi, and, by extension, Martel, have no patience for the ""dry, yeastless factuality"" that the ship officials want, you see. Never mind whether it's closer to the truth -- it's just too boring, and we need colorful stories to make our lives richer. Besides, Pi and Martel say, as soon as something leaves your mouth, it's no longer reality -- it's only your interpretation of reality. So why bother grasping for the truth? You prefer the Creation story to the Big Bang? Then go with the Creation story, even if it defies logic and scientific discovery. That's all well and good. Everyone likes a good story. But there's a time and a place for them, and the ship officials didn't need a story -- they needed to know what happened to their ship. To that end, Pi's entire tale is irrelevant anyway. And that, in turn, makes you wonder what the whole point of the book was. Other than, maybe, to laud the power of storytelling in a really hamfisted manner. Or to advocate for taking refuge in fantastical fiction when reality is too harsh. Or to champion shallow religious beliefs (""Why, Islam is nothing but an easy sort of exercise, I thought. Hot-weather yoga for the Bedouins. Asanas without sweat, heaven without strain.""). Or to bash agnostics. Or something. Be advised that this is not a book for children or the squeamish. Pi's transformation from vegetarian to unflinching killer, and Richard Parker's dietary habits, are rife with gratuituously gory details about the manner in which animals suffer and are killed and eaten. The story promises to make you believe in God. Yet with Martel's insistence that a well-crafted story is just as good as or even preferable to reality, he leaves us not believing in a god of any kind, but rather suggesting that we embrace the stories that religions have made up about their gods, regardless of those stories' relation to scientific knowledge, since the stories are so darn nice, comfy, warm, and fuzzy in comparison with real life. Whether the God in the stories actually exists, meanwhile, becomes totally irrelevant. So ultimately, Martel makes a case for why he thinks people SHOULD believe in God -- it's a respite from harsh reality, we're told, a way to hide from life rather than meet it head-on with all of its pains and struggles -- and that's quite different from what he ostensibly set out to do. He trivializes God into a ""nice story,"" a trite characterization sure to offend many readers. Pi sums up this postmodern worldview by telling the ship investigators, ""The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no?"" Well, no, the world IS just the way it is, in all of its highs and lows, triumphs and tragedies, happiness and sadness. But Pi and Martel's solution is to avoid the whole messy thing altogether, pretend that the way things are don't really exist, and pull a security blanket of fiction over your head. Create your own reality as you see fit. That's called escapism. It's fine when you want to curl up with a good book on a rainy day and get lost in the story for a few hours, but it's a lousy way to try to deal with real life. Pi would tell me that I lack imagination, just as he told the investigators they lacked imagination when Pi claimed he couldn't ""imagine"" a bonsai tree since he's never seen one, as a way of mocking the investigators' reluctance to believe in Pi's carnivorous island. (Nice cultural stereotyping with the bonsai, by the way -- the investigators are Japanese.) But you see the problem, right? It's not a matter of lacking imagination. It's a matter of conflating things that are obviously imaginary with things that are obviously real. They're not one and the same. It's ludicrous to suggest otherwise. You might as well say that the story of Frodo and the Ring is every bit as real as the American Revolution. Pi also tells us, quite pointedly, that choosing agnosticism is immobilizing, while atheists and religious folks make a courageous leap of faith. Yet immobility is precisely where Pi places us, so that by the time the book ends, you're stuck not knowing what to think about what you've just read. Do you accept the original shipwreck story just because it's more engrossing, even if it's less believable? Or do you accept the plausible but boring story Pi gives to the officials after he's rescued? Fanciful religious allegories or cold, scientific recitation of facts that might come from the mouth of an atheist -- we're expected to pick one or the other. But it's a false dichotomy. We needn't make a choice between embracing religious tales merely because they're more interesting or settling for the sobering realities of science and reason. We can go as far as our reason will take us and then leave ourselves open to further possibilities -- just as Pi himself suggests. That's not immobility. That's intellectual honesty -- an admission that I don't know all the answers but am willing to keep an open mind about whatever else is presented to me. Seems better than saying you might as well just accept the better story since it really makes no difference. That's laziness. And it doesn't make for a very good story.

9,2306917657,02/24/2018,4.0,"On the surface Life of Pi is a funny little book, heart-warming and audacious, but dig a little deeper and you’ll see how complex the story actually is. The magically real elements make the story doubt itself; they call into question the probability of these events actually happening because they are so ridiculously unrealistic. As Pi says to those that disbelieve him:
""I know what you want. You want a story that won't surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won't make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.”
Such an assertion questions the truth of fiction. The details aren’t important. Change but a few of them and the journey Pi goes on remains the same. It does not matter if he was trapped on the boat with a bunch of zoo animals or people that reflected the animals in his life, the story remains the same: the truth is not changed. Belief is stretched to absolute breaking point and sometimes it needs to be with a story like this. And such a thing harkens to the religious ideas Pi holds. He practices several religions believing they all serve the same purpose. This never wavers despite the violent and desperate times he eventually faces. And I really did appreciate this idea; it demonstrates unity in a world divided over matters of faith when it should not be. Again, are the details really that important? To a religious zealot such a thing boarders on blasphemy, though the harmony of such an idea speaks for itself in this book. “If you stumble about believability, what are you living for? Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to believe?” Although I disagree with many of the sentiments in this book, sentiments that may belong to Pi as our narrator and perhaps even to the author himself, I appreciated the degree of time taken to clarify them. The stance on religion was an interesting one with disbelief being compared to a lack of movement in one’s life (not something that I see as truth.) Zoos are also described as places of wonderment for animals rich in safety and easy living, which can be true in some cases, though the horrors of bad commercial zoos and the cruelty and exploitation that go with them are completely ignored. For me, this is not a point that can be overlooked in such fiction or in life. To do so is somewhat naïve no matter the good intentions of Pi. I did not love Life of Pi, I never could, though it is a book that made me think about the purposes of fiction and the power of stories, true or untrue.",246,0.9534,0.122,0.728,0.15,0.4637820512820513,NEGATIVE,0.9989

And I'm always happy to stop and engage in conversation about what I'm reading, and I share a few thoughts about the book. ""Yeah, it's not bad. Pretty good so far.""""Really enjoying it! Better than I expected!""""Oh man, it's alright I guess. Kinda slow.""I like to keep my comments pretty general in nature. Also, that never actually happens to me. Or does it?Anyway, I did tell a few people I was reading Life of Pi and every single one of them said, ""Oh yeah, isn't that the book about the guy and a tiger on a raft?"" Because that's what everyone thinks of when they think of Life of Pi. The book about some guy on a boat with a tiger. And they are absolutely right. I mean, if you needed a one sentence synopsis of Life of Pi you would say it's about some dude floating around on a raft or a boat or something with a tiger, and that would be it. You nailed it. Except Pi isn't on a lifeboat with Richard Parker (the tiger) until about halfway through the book. So that synopsis isn't enough because there is so much more going on in Life of Pi. So much more. So let's start with the biggest reason this book gets a coveted five star rating from me: I got to learn all about zoos and the animals that inhabit them. I'm kidding, a little, kind of, but the beginning of the book is just fascinating to read. Pi weaves in stories of his childhood with facts about India, religion, animals, zoos, family, and all kinds of other stuff. One scene in particular that I loved was when Pi was trying to determine his religion and the choice that follows. Just humorous, insightful stuff all around, and I forgot all about what the book is really about. I won't remind you. The story moves from all of that stuff, like a memoir I guess, to an adventure story. Now, I'm not a huge adventure story kind of guy, but the writing was so engaging and the audiobook narration was so intoxicating that I kept plugging along with all the craziness Pi finds himself in. It gets pretty violent and a little disgusting at times, but you're reading about wild animals and about a guy who is caught in a horrible tale of survival. It's not too bad. Then, the end of the book comes along, and oh my god I can't even tell you about the end of the book. It's awesome though. Just trust me on this one if you haven't read it already. You've probably read it already. You've probably seen the movie, too, you awesome person you. Look at you go, all awesome and stuff. I'm gonna watch the movie as soon as possible. Looking forward to it. This was a fantastic audiobook that I spent almost a month listening to during my morning commute. Whatever I pop in next has a tough act to follow. January has been a pretty solid month of reading for me. Definitely ended it on a high note. I don't rate books five stars very often because I'm am overly critical book critic, but this is a five star read that deserves a little bit of your time.",159,0.9957,0.055,0.793,0.152,0.636750992063492,POSITIVE,0.9658
14,396282901,08/20/2012,3.0,"’ Life is a peephole, a single tiny entry onto a vastness.’We have all heard the phrase ‘you can’t judge a book by it’s cover.’ While this is a good life lesson, especially when taken as a metaphor that extends beyond books and into people, places, foods, etc., sometimes the cover of a novel is very telling of what lies within. Yann Martel’s Life of Pi wears it’s heart on it’s sleeve. A quick glance at the cover shows the overzealous stamp of ‘Winner of the Man Booker Prize’, INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER, the indication that, yes, this is ‘A Novel’, and an image that both depicts the major plot point of the novel, thus spoiling the surprise of who Richard Parker really is. All this praise lauded upon the cover is instantly telling that this is a novel that has reached a wide audience, and is most likely aimed towards wide critical acclaim. That is all fine, and bravo to Mr. Martel for being able to leave his mark on the bestseller list, something I can only imagine in my wildest of wildest dreams, but sometimes when reaching for a large audience you have to elbow out a small percentage of readers. I am that small percentage that was elbowed out by Martel’s attempt to make an accessible novel that will touch the reader on a spiritual level. This is a difficult novel to review as, firstly, I did enjoy reading the book. I gave in to reading this book that I have been purposely avoiding after reading the excellent review from mi Hermana. I had a lot of fun discussing this book with her, texting her my shocks and suprises in the plot, and discussing the book in several threads with fellow Goodreaders. As anyone can see with a quick glance at the overall ratings, this book seems to really strike a chord in many readers, yet also brings a large crowd of dissenters. While I did extract a good deal of pleasure from the novel, it just didn’t sit well with me at the same time. In all fairness to the novel, and to my usual reading list, I have to dissect this book with the same views of novels that I would any other. This begs the question as to ‘why do we read?’, and this reason differs from person to person much like each persons meaning of life – a theme explored in Pi. Life of Pi was a pleasurable read that suffered from a heavy-handed serving of morality. While Martel delivers one charming phrase after the next with a graceful flow, he would have greatly benefited from a touch of subtlety.All to often, Martel would draw conclusions for the reader. A prime example occurs in the first few pages when Pi’s science teacher visits the Zoo (a zoo that he does not hold back from explaining how it serves as a metaphor for humanity), and calls out the name of well-known scientists whose studies pertain to the activities of the animals he is currently viewing. Martel spoils the moment by explaining that Mr. Kumar liked to prove to himself ‘that everything was order’. It felt as if Martel didn’t believe his readers could connect the dot. Even more obscure ideas are spoiled in such a manner. When a rain of flying fish saves Pi and Richard Parker from certain hunger, he thanks Vishnu saying ‘once you saved the world by taking the form of a fish. Now you have saved me by taking the form of a fish’. While I would not have made this connection, it ruins that ‘ah-ha!’ moment for those that do. It is that special moment of understanding an allusion in literature that keeps me reading a wide variety of texts, and it seems insulting to have someone to make connections without giving you an opportunity. Even at the very end, in his shocking twist of an ending (I must profess this novel has an incredible conclusion), the two Chinese men literally draw the connections for you saying something to the effect of ‘oh, this is this and that means that…’. This all seems to be Martel’s way of making sure his message gets heard, and is able to reach everyone. It is a noble goal, and it gets people who do not typically read to like and enjoy a book, so I cannot necessarily knock him for it as that was his goal, but this is all to my chagrin. ‘It's important in life to conclude things properly,’ Pi explains, ‘only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse’. The question now is, does Martel conclude things properly? I personally loved the conclusion to this book. He successfully pulls the rug out from under the reader and exposes the real message behind the book. Without spoiling anything, this novel makes a good statement on the powers of storytelling with both a fun plot device and well crafted statements such as ‘that's what fiction is about, isn't it, the selective transforming of reality? The twisting of it to bring out its essence?’ Had he left it at that, it would have been wonderful and allowed for mass interpretability and the reader could have easily connected it to spirituality. However, Martel forces the connection to religion down the reader’s throat. The whole beginning section of the novel, which details Pi’s exploration of various religions, seems irrelevant for the majority the novel. Occasionally he will pray or include some stunning statements on the beauty of life and the grace of God/gods, but it seems to have been only there to make sure you were looking for the religious metaphors in the plot and comes across as Martel with a death grip on the readers head, jerking it back and forth shouting ‘look here! Notice that! Remember what we talked about!?’ While much of the focus on spirituality was well done, it was far too heavy-handed and led to a rather narrow interpretation on the ending. My major concern is that Martel only gave us what he thought the reader would want, making quotes such as ‘ I know what you want. You want a story that won’t surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won’t make you see higher or further or differently,’ seem like he wasn’t being as ironic with the ending as he hoped it would be. While the conclusion comes out as ‘bet you didn’t see that coming’, it really doesn’t say anything that hasn’t been said before. The novel is heralded as being an affirmation of faith, and that’s exactly what it is, an affirmation. It isn’t going to challenge your beliefs, although he does an excellent job allowing different religious figures to challenge the differences in belief of one another even if it is the same concepts anyone would learn in a 100 level humanities course; it isn’t going to convert any readers to a life of devotion; it only provides a blanket and a comfort to those that already believe. Which, once again, is not a bad thing, if that is what you are looking for. It reminded me of something a professor once told me in a World Religions course. He described church as something that, and this is his opinion, is a crutch for those who needed it. He compared the obligation to attend to telling a girlfriend you only hang out with them because you feel you have to and are obligated to. While his opinion is a bit harsh and easily offensive, what he was really trying to say is you should believe because you want to, not because you have to. Martel makes it seem like you have to believe in these things, and I see why that makes this book hard to swallow for someone who doesn’t. Once again, in hopes to reassure and reach a large audience, Martel rudely elbows out the remainder. However, I really feel uncomfortable discussing beliefs on the open seas of the internet, and I really hope nothing said here offends you as that is not my intention. Please understand I am only speaking in relevance to my thoughts on a book, not on religion. The insistence of Martel to wrap a cool concept with spirituality is a major reason why it is so difficult to talk about this book. It is hard to separate the two ideas, but I’m doing my best to keep this focused on the literary aspects. I’m getting too self-conscious! The whole point here is that a lot of what Martel says has been said before, better, and with more willingness to evoke a change in the reader.All that said, there is a lot that I truly enjoyed about this book. If you push all the aforementioned details aside, this was a wild ride. This made me want to visit zoos and hug a tiger. Look how cute this tiger is:  Tell me you don’t want to hug that! I really enjoyed the wealth of zoological knowledge Martel bestows upon the reader, and his insistence on seeming ‘realistic’ with his animals. After reading this book, you will know why you should never, ever try to hug a tiger or take a wild animal for granted. He makes an interesting point how we force cute cuddly animal toys on children and make them think they are some domestic pet. While this is used as an excellent point that humans are the villain, which is easily slotted into the religious issues as an explanation that it isn’t religion that causes violence but the people abusing the rhetoric, it does seem ironically opposed to his final statement of how religion glosses over the grimy, difficult to handle details of life and makes it easier to handle. Are cute cuddly animal toys then religion? This novel is a very positive message to the world, and anything promoting peace and harmony can’t be all that bad. I enjoyed statements such as ‘ If there's only one nation in the sky, shouldn't all passports be valid for it?’, which is an important idea considering the violence that takes place around the world. I also enjoyed how the animal story is also chock full of scientific facts and details, which fuses the idea of religion and science together instead of showing them as opposites. Thre were some symbolism, the ones he left untainted by a forced explanation, that really struck me. The tiger itself is open for many views, either as God, Pi, or life itself - something we must face and tame lest it destroy us. However, could it be the killer inside us all, an urge and animalistic force we must keep in check in order to exist in a civilized society? In a way, I felt that the ending could almost be an attack on religion, showing it as nothing more than a pretty way of viewing a world as ugly as our own. I felt that the tarpauline served as a similar symbol. It was a feeling of security, something to stand on, but underneath was the violent truth of a deadly tiger. Perhaps it was our personal sense of security which is actually just thin and flimsy. When Martel doesn't slap us with his meaning, it is quite good.I was simply not the intended audience for this novel. However, Martel has a positive message that he wanted to reach a wide audience in hopes to spread peace to a world badly in need of it, so I cannot be too harsh on him. He achieved his goals for the novel, but his novel did not reach my goals for literature. Still, this was a fun read and I would recommend it. Just ask yourself, ‘why read?’ and if the cons of this review outweigh the pros, then this novel is not for you. But if you desire something that will entertain, broaden your horizons of spirituality if you don’t know much about various religions, or reaffirm your faith, well look no further.3.5/5‘ Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can.’Here's more tigers.

In reality, this book is an examination of faith in all its forms. Young Pi loves God, and to prove it he becomes Christian and Muslim in addition to his native Hinduism. He also loves animals, and much of the book examines animal psychology and its relationship to human psychology in a vibrant, interesting way. This book had me asking questions about my life, my beliefs, and my society on just about every page....and when the reader gets to the end (which I won't spoil here), the reader is forced to ask themself the kind of person they really are. If ever there was a novel that could be called a litmus test, it's this one. ""The Life of Pi"" will, at the very least, entertain through its sharp storytelling, but it can also help a reader examine how they see the world - and isn't that the point of great literature?Favorite quotes:""I felt a kinship with him. It was my first clue that atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith, and every word they speak speaks of faith. LIke me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them - and then they leap.""""But I don't insist. I don't mean to defend zoos. Close them all down if you want (and let us hope that what wildlife remains can survive in what is left of the natural world). I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.""""And so, when she first heard of Hare Krishnas, she didn't hear right. She heard 'hairless Christians', and that is what they were to her for many years. When I corrected her, I told her that in fact she was not so wrong; that Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.""""Christianity is a religion in a rush. Look at the world created in seven days. Even on a symbolic level, that's creation in a frenzy. To one born in a religion where the battle for a single soul can be a relay race run over many centuries, with innumerable generations passing along the baton, the quick resolution of Christianity has a dizzying effect. If Hinduism flows placidly like the Ganges, then Christianity bustles like Toronto at rush hour. It is a religion as swift as a swallow, as urgent as an ambulance. It turns on a dime, expresses itself in the instant. In a moment, you are lost or saved. Christianity stretches back through the ages, but in essence it exists only at one time: right now.""",117,0.9975,0.034,0.792,0.174,0.4623666225749558,POSITIVE,0.6466

It's a castaway story and like all castaway and shipwreck stories it's about human endurance, indomitable spirit and man vs. nature. The things that distinguish this story from Robinson Crusoe or Tom Hanks in Cast Away, is that the main character (Pi, short for Piscine) is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. He's Indian and multi-religious - a true believer in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. He comes from a family of zookeepers who were transporting their animals by freighter. This is how he wound up with a tiger in his lifeboat. It's an inspiring book, but drags in spots -- more than 200 days at sea is a lot of fish and storm stories. I kept waiting for the multi-religious theme to play a real role in the story but it did so only peripherally, so the plot seems a bit disconnected. In the end, we are offered two stories: one of murder and cannibalism and one of a journey in the lifeboat with animals. A key theme comes at the end of the book in a throwaway line: Which story do you prefer? So it is with God. It's a good read and a unique plot.

21,427342870,10/03/2012,5.0,"This is not a story of a boy and his BFF tiger.This is nothing like Calvin and Hobbes.The tiger is nothing like Tigger or Lassie.This is not a YA book.That is worth pointing out I think, because the movie poster and trailer gave me this impression.This book has teeth.My initial thoughts on Life of Pi is that it is a book that demands to be read slowly due to a rambling nonlinear narrative in the first few chapters. Actually it is not, it can be read fairly quickly once you hit your stride with it. Any way, the novel got off to a slow start for me though I found the intro ""Author's Notes"" immediately appealing. Initially I was also a bit confused about which part is narrated by the author and which by Piscine ""Pi"" Molitor Patel‎ the book's protagonist. That sorts itself out after a while as I settled into the author's narrative style and the book's structure. There are some expositions about about running a zoo and animal psychology which I find very interesting. I certainly know some people who believe zoos are immoral and all the caged animals should be set free, this book presents a plausible case for why this may not be such a good idea and that the animals are unlikely to be grateful to the liberators. I am not normally a fan of infodumps, but these expositions are affably written and mostly non-technical.Once the main part of the story begins, where poor Pi is cast away on a life boat with some wild animals the books becomes very engaging and I was devouring his adventure and could not wait to find out what happen next. The ocean adventure part of the book is really a riveting read. As Pi settles into his life on the life boat the book becomes trippy and metaphysical in parts. If you read online discussions about this book you will find several interpretation of what it all means and what really transpires in the book. To go into too much detail about this ambiguous aspect of the book would risk spoiling the book for potential readers, suffice to say that the book left me with plenty of food for thought which is still swirling in my head as I write. Art by Neanderthal-JamThere are elements of humour scattered throughout the book, the style of humor tend to be fairly subtle, my favorite humorous scene involves three bickering wise men and a boy of multiple faiths. I also love how the major supporting character Richard Parker came by his name. My favorite aspect of the book is the prose style which is lyrical, accessible and generally very pleasant to read. Here is one of my favorite passages:
""I will not die. I refuse it. I will make it through this nightmare. I will beat the odds, as great as they are. I have survived so far, miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine. The amazing will be seen every day. I will put in all the hard work necessary. Yes, so long as God is with me, I will not die. Amen.""
Even if you are entirely irreligious you can still appreciate the eloquence of the writing.This book is often classified as a fantasy but I wonder if it is actually more scifi? Some strange places and things are rationalized with scientific assumptions, particularly a mysterious island that appears in the last section of the book. Some people are understandably frustrated and annoyed by the epilogue of the book where everything seems to turn upside down, or not depending on how you want to interpret this part of the book. It surprised the hell out of me but adds to the enjoyment of the book, and I don't think it invalidates anything that goes on in the preceding chapters. Looking at other Goodreads reviews Life of Pi seems to be divisive among its readers. Quite a few people find the book pretentious and not as intelligent or profound as the author presents it to be. They may be on to something, I don't really know. Oftentimes I find the reviewers just as pretentious as the book they are criticizing, is this a case of an eye for an eye? Personally I just wanted it to be entertaining and interesting and it meets these criteria in spades. A little pretentiousness does not bother me as long as the book is a good read.I have no qualms at all about recommending this book, may be you will love it like I do, may be it will make you mad and you will throw it at the wall. I really don't know how it will be for you. Totally worth a shot in my opinion. Art by gluecifer",98,0.9981,0.062,0.784,0.155,0.5282278613199667,NEGATIVE,0.7908

In the most desperate of circumstances, while Pi is on his lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, imagination and storytelling are the keys to Pi's incredible story of survival. Issues about believability, what really happened on the boat, take a backseat to wonder, love, creativity and to a certain extent, madness. The novel is heavy on spirituality, but it is compelling and Pi's evolving relationship with Richard Parker keeps their 227 days at sea interesting.

I can honestly say I’ve never pondered life, religion, survival - and how far a human can be pushed - as deeply as I have since I began my journey with Piscine Molitor Patel. I questioned faith and contemplated how far it could carry someone who's hanging on by a thread. I asked myself if I could have survived even half of what Pi had endured? Probably not, but who knows how strong the will to live is until it's put to the test? This is undoubtedly a book that gave me pause for thought.Nature is as volatile as it is beautiful and, as an animal lover, I must warn those who might be disturbed by scenes of savagery (i.e. the natural order of life and death as it exists in the animal kingdom).

25,378164127,07/27/2012,3.0,"As near as I can say, this should probably be 3.141592654 stars.I was disappointed in this novel, but not really surprised at this. Rather I was somewhat prepared for it, because the ratings for it, specifically by my GR friends and reviewers (people I follow), are all over the place. While over half of these ratings are good (4s and 5s), fully 28% are bad (1s and 2s). This is the highest percent of bad ratings for a Booker award winner since 2000 among these people.And, as indicated by my own rating, there were things I liked about the book. But before I get into any more detail, I will warn readers that there are some mild spoiler type comments in what follows. Most of these are general comments about the structure or message of the book. In one place where I say something very specific about the plot I have used the normal spoiler alert.So … what I liked about the book was (surprise) probably most of it. I found the main storyline taking place in the boat not only an enjoyable read, but even quite believable. I would be willing (if most of the novel had been published as an actual memoir by a sea disaster survivor) to believe even the bit about the companion that he survived with. I thought the explanation given of how the relation developed between Pi and his feline companion made enough sense to believe. But there were a number of things about the book that I really disliked. (1) The Author’s Note which begins the book is probably something that many readers didn’t even read, since I know some don’t read prefatory material in books. I always read this stuff, and I was quite confused when I read this note. Of course I assumed it was a genuine comment by Martel, but finally realized that it is itself part of the fiction. Besides being confused by this material, I was amazed that the author seemed to be claiming that the story he was about to relate would make me believe in God. But more on that later.(2) Skipping to the other end of the book, the last section, in which Pi is interviewed by the Japanese investigators, struck me first as a very lame attempt at humor (of a rather condescending nature, since it makes these investigators out as complete fools). The way in which Pi is represented as a superior being to these buffoons was more irritating to me than humorous. But the worst part of this section is the alternate story that Pi tells the men when they express disbelief in the story he tells them of his survival. Then, after relating this alternate story, he asks them to believe the one they “like best”. Not the one they think is more probably true, but the one they like best! And these simpletons take Pi up on his request, decide that they like his original story better (no small wonder) and conclude the investigation. Presumably readers are supposed to decide that we too will believe Pi’s story because we like it better than the grisly alternative? (But again, more on this later.) (3) Several chapters near the end of the sea story seemed weak to me, for various reasons. (view spoiler)[ - Chapter 85 (“Once there was lightning …”) seems like an obligatory couple hundred words on something that might happen at sea in a lifeboat, but plays no part in the story; rather, it simply provides a setting for Pi to blather on about how the experience of a close lightning strike swept him into paroxysms of wonder about divinity, God, etc. etc. - Chapter 86 relates the (unlikely in the extreme) incident of almost being run over by a gigantic tanker (aimed straight at them from thousands of miles away no doubt), which of course has a crew to whom the lifeboat is entirely invisible.- Chapter 88 (One day we came upon trash …) seems like a meaningless mention of the garbage floating in the Pacific – but it gives Pi the opportunity to pick up a corked (empty) wine bottle, put a note in it, and launch it back into the ocean and out of the story.- Chapter 89. Now, all of a sudden, the narrative shifts abruptly, with no explanation. Up to this point it has been an interesting survival story, in which Pi is getting along pretty well, Richard Parker has been “tamed”, Pi seems to be having no problem catching both fish and rain water to keep himself and R.P. eating and drinking. All of a sudden he and R.P. are both descending rapidly towards first blindness and then death.- Chapter 90. Here the nonsense really starts. The blind Pi’s boat amazingly bumps into another lifeboat being rowed by another blind man in the middle of the Pacific Ocean! This is a rather long chapter, filled with conversation between these two blind men, which I’m afraid went right over my head. The only thing I see it adding to the story is that Pi eventually gets some extra water from this man’s boat, and R.P. gets an extra several meals.- Chapter 92 (“I made an exceptional botanical discovery …”) must be terribly significant, since it goes on for almost 30 pages, and indeed basically concludes the sea portion of the story. This chapter is completely unbelievable, could almost make someone think we are engaged with magical realism. Except it doesn’t feel like that sort of writing. These strange occurrence aren’t “magical”, they are simply weird, near-but-not-entirely-impossible - or perhaps “divine”. Perhaps the last two chapters mentioned are meant to introduce a “miraculous” element into the plot, so that the claim that the story will prompt belief in God can be “demonstrated”. Anyway, once Pi and R.P. have left this living island, we find them completely resuscitated, sight and health (but not spirit, oddly) restored, and in less than 100 words (Chapter 93) the boat is washing through the surf towards a beach in Mexico. (hide spoiler)]So, in conclusion I’ll make the following observations:1. Much of the story was an enjoyable read for me; but much was irritating, as I’ve explained above. One thing I can be thankful for is that, although I could have spent the time reading any number of books I would have enjoyed more, reading Life of Pi at least saved me from spending money on the movie.2. I have to believe that many of the things I found irritating were actually felt to be strong points by the Booker voters. To me, these unusual/irritating aspects of the novel often felt gimmicky. This extends even to the first person narrative, which I think was likely a point in favor of the book’s winning, but which I’m not sure I enjoyed as much as most people apparently did.3. I’m pretty sure that many people who enjoyed the book were helped on that path by their view that the story, somehow or other, made them feel good about their religious outlook. Now this aspect of the book would certainly not appeal to me, but my perception that the book contained those ideas didn’t keep me from reading it. I have no problem with reading fiction about people who have different religious views than mine, and Pi certainly seems to qualify on that count.4. Finally, and commenting further on the last point, I began to wonder, as I was putting this review together, whether Pi’s views of God are actually meant to be admired. Might it not be the fact that the author is, however gently and tactfully, perhaps holding them up to ridicule? I certainly have no idea about the author’s religious beliefs, but for all I know he might not be religious at all. Consider: First, in the Author’s Note we find the assertion (by the fictitious Indian man who tells the tale to the author) that the story will make the author (and us readers by extension) believe in God. Does that mean that the author doesn’t believe in God? And of course, the author of this fiction must know very well that a fiction could not possibly have that effect on a rational person. Second, in the final short chapter before the sea-story ends on the Mexican beach, “Pi” writes The lower you are, the higher your mind will want to soar. It was natural that, bereft and desperate as I was, in the throes of unremitting suffering, I should turn to God.Right, that’s pretty much what Marx said about religion being an opiate. So, is Pi revealing (presumably unintentionally) his real reasons for believing in God? Third, in the final segment with the Japanese investigators, Pi is able to get them to “believe” his original story “with the animals” by simply asking them So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can’t prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with the animals or the story without animals?Mr. Okamoto: That’s an interesting question …Mr. Chiba: The story with animals.Mr. Okamoto: Yes. The story with animals is the better story.Pi: Thank you. And so it goes with God.Thus, the story with God is the better story … we like it more … it makes us feel better … … … QED",84,0.9987,0.085,0.77,0.145,0.5228198223733935,NEGATIVE,0.9999
26,111445355,07/13/2010,4.0,"A man very much aware of the literary elements (obviously an avid reader and serious lit student), Yann Martel proves that a classic can certainly be construed.

“The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no?Doesn't that make life a story?”
Life is a story and the story of Pi Patel is one of the most extraordinary stories that I have read in awhile. The story begins before the fateful shipwreck that makes up most of the novel. Pi is a little boy who lives in India on a zoo that his father owns. Pretty much the greatest place to live as a kid is on a zoo. After watching We Bought a Zoo and reading this book I really want to live on a zoo, even though I would have a very hard time NOT petting the animals. The talk that the father gives Pi and his brother Ravi is one I would also need cause I mean tigers are just so cute!but also deadly… http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBzolw...That leads to this remarkable story of how a boy manages to survive not only a shipwreck but also being in a lifeboat with a huge Bengal Tiger and several other animals. But before that all happens I found the beginning of the book quite interesting. I didn’t realize that this book dealt mainly with the theme of faith and belief. While Pi is growing up he explores different forms of faith and instead of picking one decides to be Catholic, Islamic, and Hindu all at the same time. Being Catholic I found the scene of him first talking to the priest really mind opening in a way. Pi questions a lot about the religion at first having a hard time imagining and having grown up Catholic I never asked those questions myself but when he asked them I found myself thinking, “you know now that I think about it some of this doesn’t make sense.” But that’s the point of faith I guess it doesn’t all have to make sense. With all the changes occurring in India Pi and his family choose to move to Canada and take most of the animals from the zoo with them to sell to zoos mostly in America. On the way the boat sinks and Pi is left alone in a lifeboat with a tiger, hyena, zebra, and orangutan. If it wasn’t for Pi’s internal conflict especially with how to deal with Richard Parker this book could have easily gotten very dry and boring as he just continues to float and going through a very repetitive day. Yet never once did this book get boring or even repetitive. While on the boat Pi has to come to face his fate, death by water or death by tiger, and also his faith. But even when things seemed the grimmest Pi never stopped fighting for his life.
“You might think I lost all hope at that point. I did. And as a result I perked up and felt much better.”
 This book was very beautifully written and moving. You really connect with Pi and hurt with him and love with him. You love the tiger that at any moment could kill Pi but I really believe what Pi says that without the tiger he would have died. Richard Parker gave him a reason to live, without him Richard would die, and if Richard died he would forever be alone. The parting of Pi and Richard was pretty much heart wrenching even though it was probably for the best. 
“Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart.”
 My favorite line of the entire book for many reasons. Ultimately this book is about faith and at the end about taking a leap of faith. After reading the whole book the last few chapters almost tore me apart. I don’t want to give away what happens but it just makes your heart fall. It ends with a big question mark and it is up for you to decide. Think one-way and the story changes for you and it isn’t at all what you thought it was. I decided to take a leap of faith and believe even when it seems impossible and I think that is truly what this book is about and what you take out of it is for you yourself to decide. Just like faith it can’t decide for you. Will you question and leave faith behind or let it lead you when all seems to change? 
“If you stumble about believability, what are you living for? Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to believe?”

I don't think Pi went through such pain as I did when I realized to my dismay that the middle and the end of the book didn't come close to the engaging, complex beginning. I loved the incorporation of the religious theme into Pi's life at the beginning. The time in the zoo set the stage for what would follow. But once out to sea, the spiritual connections disappeared and instead I felt like I was reading a raw, literal account of a survivor's journey. Like Hemingway might have written, but not as well done. There were rare moments of connection and deeper understanding, but not enough to keep me afloat to the end. By the end of Pi's journey, I felt as devastated as he must have -I guess the author succeeded in making me feel empathetic? But I still felt hope that the end would pull through and make my suffering well worth it. Instead, I felt like the end was almost as bad as the middle. It brought back the metaphorical and spiritual feel to a certain degree, but not enough to redeem the book for me, and not in the direction I had hoped.

Without it, no species would survive.”Pi's father put a living goat into the tiger's cage which did not eat in days, and pi witnessed the tiger eat the goat alive.He didn’t know that this is the fate that was waiting for him And that his brother words would come true and he would be the next goat And that he would experience his deepest, horrible and terrifyingfear.Reading this book with its continuous relating and humanization of animals acts ,remind me of a story that I have read a famous and tragic accident ,remind me of a story that I have read it happened in 1972 at Cairo circus.The story began in front of a crowd of spectators in the circus when a lion tamer turned his back to the lionsTo receive a well-deserved applause for the perfect and successful performance.in a brief moment a lion jumped on his shoulder and attacked him by his claws and teeth the coach fell to the ground bleeding and it was too late to save him he died in the hospital in a few days ,what the lion did later was really strange.  the lion was involved in a case of depression and refused food and the circus manager decided to transfer him to the zoo as this lion is not suitable for training in the circusany more the lion continued on a hunger strike, they get him a lioness but he cruelly beat and expelled her he continues his isolation and depression and psychotic insanity, finally he went on biting his body ,his tail and hand especially (the hand he put on his trainer)and started eating them in the wild, and raged manner ,he eventually bled and died,.the behavior of this lion, who committed suicide is very unique to this much he can understand and feel the responsibility of his act??!!And repent for his betrayalI cant call this action a""human action""As this is more noble animals only kill out of protection or out of necessity. Humans, on the other hand, kill for greed, insanity ,or forethnic or racial, religious purposesthis is whyI just want to believe the story with the animals.A similar theme was discussed in an old Arabic book of Ikhwan as-Safa or the Brethren of Purity,where a trial for human race was held by animals .""This was the terrible cost of Richard Parker. He gave me a life, my own, but at the expense of taking one. He ripped the flesh off the man's frame and cracked his bones. The smell of blood filled my nose. Something in me died then that has never come back to life.""One of the darkest momentsAnd I think the temporary blindness was a strong symbolism for blindness of his heart And loss of insight Which is Worse than the blindness of eyes And his silence about the unjust cruel Crime that is done in front of him.Richard Parker didn’t give pi a “proper farewell” as Richard didn’t feel pi ’s love he was always running scared of him in fear that he may eat him.you cant fear AND love someone at the same time, if u love someone your fear would be you loose this love."" fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever,treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, showsno mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unerring ease. It begins in your mind,always. One moment you are feeling calm, self-possessed, happy. Then fear, disguised in the garbof mild-mannered doubt, slips into your mind like a spy. Doubt meets disbelief and disbelief tries topush it out. But disbelief is a poorly armed foot soldier. Doubt does away with it with little trouble.""In order to save yourself from the enemy u should understand how his mind works. and this is when pi could interact with the tiger, when he could get into the tiger's mind.and the exhausting opposites"" The worst pair of opposites is boredom and terror.""""

37,281749529,02/21/2012,3.0,"Yann Martel has said his inspiration for Life of Pi came from a Brazilian book called Max And The Cats A Novel by Moacyr Scliar. The premise of a boy sharing a lifeboat with a big cat is the same and it's an obvious connection. Other than this basic premise, I don't know how much the two books have in common. But for tone and feel, I think the real inspiration for Martel is The Little Prince, a beautiful children's book with a philosophical subtext presented in a gentle whimsical manner. Both books are about being stranded all alone and then suddenly having to deal with an unpredictable companion, forced to question what is important and how one ought to approach life. Any writer striving after Saint-Exupéry has his heart in the right place. It is a hard act to follow however, and Martel's material completely gets away from him. Life of Pi has absolute moments of brilliance and I loved many things about it. How I wanted this book to succeed! I was cheering for it like a soccer mom at her kid's big game. Imagine my face falling then, when the kid has a breakaway and is running with the ball the wrong way to his own end zone...One of the ways things go wrong in Pi is Martel's complete lack of faith in the reader. He assumes we just won't get ""it"". He explains pretty much everything as it happens, and then re-explains it again later. Although I must say I'm not bitter about it because he doesn't do it in an insulting way. No, he's more like an enthusiastic child who is bursting with delight and cannot hold back.  The larger flaw is his fumbling of ambiguity, and for this story ambiguity is its heart and soul. These fumbles begin with his discussions of religion and philosophy, but it's really bad in the ending. I do not wish to add a spoiler, but I'll say that where a hint, an incongruity or even a single well placed word could have cast a doubt in our minds, Yann chooses rather to blast away and spell the whole thing out. I bought this edition at the Goodwill! My favourite store. They wanted to charge $4.00, but I *proved* it was a kid's book by showing the pictures, and got it for $1.49. The unsound ethics of buying books second-hand got just that little bit worse in my hands ;-)Life of Pi really inspires visual interpretation: I wish I could convey the perfection of a seal slipping into water or a spider monkey swinging from point to point or a lion merely turning its head. But language founders in such seas. Better to picture it in your head if you want to feel it. A few of the illustrations from my edition:

No real conclusions were drawn at this point. This was then followed in turn by a discussion on authors who Dr Nick was unsure of the gender of. And also some that I was confused about too.

If we, citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams.
This is a review I've been putting off writing. I read it almost two months ago, and I'm still not quite sure what to say about it that hasn't already been said. It has been on my radar for years, and then I saw the movie when it came out (knowing that I was committing a huge book nerd party foul since I hadn't yet read it) because it was just so beautiful, and that TIGER! Oh god, that tiger was amazing.I read this book at the request of my friend who knew I was going through some stuff. She promised me that I was not going to be disappointed. And I most definitely was not. Oh no. I read this during a time in my life when I seriously needed to believe in something. Anything. And this book will make you believe in something. I believe now more than ever in the power of words. Art. Storytelling. Because this book may be about a lot of things. An Indian Boy named Pi. A tiger named Richard Parker. Survival. Desperation. Loss of innocence. Fear. Hope. Faith. God. But above all, this book is about stories, and how humans have this innate need to tell them, hoping that some kind of wisdom or truth may be passed along with them from generation to generation. We humans have this pressing need to be heard.The first 100 or so pages of this novel can be interpreted as dull. Bland. Boring. This is the clinical side of Pi, the detailed and descriptive part of him. The part that desperately needs us to understand him. He tells the reader about his journey to find God. He first falls in love with the Hindu god Krishna, then the Christian Jesus, and finally the Muslim Allah. He embraces all three gods and all three religions as if they are one. His family and friends do not understand him, and think him odd, but Pi has this absolutely beautiful peace about him that even I, as only a reader, envied. Once Pi finds god, he goes on and on about his father's zoo, and more specifically about the science of zoology. What motivates different species to behave the way they do, how they interact with other species and each other. It was this part that I found the most intrusive and cumbersome, but honestly, it was only a small fraction of my reading experience. This clinical approach to his writing style comes into play much later, and I understood Yann Martel's decision to write in this way in the beginning. As you can find out for yourself by reading the back cover, Pi travels to Canada with his family and several animals after his zookeeper father decides to sell the zoo and leave India when the ship sinks and Pi is left as the only survivor. Well, the only human survivor.Pi's journey has now begun, and in his telling of his beautiful story, a story which will make you believe in God, all of the clinical backstory of the first hundred pages begins to make sense. It is this knowledge of animals that sets Pi apart and enables him to survive with a 450 pound adult Bengal tiger on board a small lifeboat in the ocean for months. He understands how and why they behave, and this knowledge not only saves his life, but creates a certain bond with the beast, as much of a bond as these two different species can have. This relationship becomes truly beautiful, and I hungrily read page after page, waiting for it to develop. Pi became such a strong and memorable character for me, and never once was I bored in reading this. Martel weaves some beauty and magic in this telling of Pi's story, and I realized just how perfect this story was for me during a crazy time in my own life. The movie was breathtakingly beautiful, but words...words bring it to life.Without being spoilery, I will say that at the end of the novel, the reader is faced with a choice of what to believe. We humans do tend to color our stories differently depending on our audience. Sometimes, two stories are colored differently, but the outcome is still the same. If the outcome is the same, does it matter how we get there? Just as art is an exaggeration of life, shouldn't words be the same? Isn't storytelling just another art form? Why shouldn't words express a more colorful world than the one the truth might offer? Pi Patel beleived in three different gods from three different religions equally. Each god has their own stories, their own myths, their own beliefs, values, and meanings. But really, in the end, all three are God. Sometimes it is the story of how we got here that makes us keep telling stories. And really, what are religions but a bunch of stories that teach us how to live? Did they happen exactly as they are told? Does it even matter? I got to the end of this beautiful book and realized that it doesn't matter what choice I've made and what it is that I believe. Both choices are the same, just colored in different ways.4.5 stars.",48,0.9989,0.03,0.821,0.149,0.5986538075145672,NEGATIVE,0.8814
40,150960788,02/27/2011,3.0,"Having finished this, I am finding myself feeling thoroughly ambivalent about it. I can't think of anything overwhelmingly positive or overhwelmingly negative to say in this review. It was just alright. I've read lots of books that could be described in the same way, but I expected more from this, particularly since it won the Booker prize. The beginning - describing narrator Pi Patel's childhood in India, growing up surrounded by exotic, dangerous animals as the son of a zookeeper - is promising. Some of the prose is rather beautiful, and at their best the descriptions evoke the sights and sounds of Pi's environment vividly. However, following this pleasant introduction, the bulk of the book is taken up by a lengthy account of the protagonist's attempts to survive on board a lifeboat after the ship carrying his family to Canada sinks, leaving Pi and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker the only survivors. The excitement of the situation soon abates; once the tiger has dispatched a few other surviving animals and Pi has managed to train him, all that's left is a repetitive series of chapters about how Pi stays alive. I couldn't stomach much of the stuff about Pi killing and eating whatever forms of life he comes across (there are more mentions of drinking turtles' blood than any story could ever need) and skipped the majority of these chapters (there's LOTS of them). The book becomes very monotonous, and while this may indeed represent what struggling to stay alive on a boat in the middle of a vast ocean would be like, it's not an attractive attribute in a work of fiction. Right at the end, there's suddenly a really good bit which makes you yearn for how good the book could have been. First there's a sequence - possibly a fantasy/dream/allegory - in which Pi disovers a seemingly idyllic island with a sinister secret. Then there's the last few chapters, in which he recounts his tale, alongside an alternative version, to a pair of investigators. This part of the story is intriguing, funny and contains a fascinating twist; I really enjoyed it. It's just a shame I couldn't feel the same way about most of what came before these concluding pages.Edited 29/12/12 to add... The film is better than the book. I've seen it in the cinema twice now, and it turns out this story is much more enjoyable to watch than it is to read.

41,1358870045,10/28/2016,2.0,"There is a compelling story in here, but unfortunately it's burdened by excessive explanation, confused religious allegory and mediocre writing. The Author's Note promises that the story will make you believe in God. The problem was not that I didn't find the message persuasive, it was that the message was so confused it wasn't clear what it actually was, or in what way it was supposed to point towards a confirmation of God. I get the impression that the aim was less about persuasion, than it was about reinforcing notions of the importance of faith that are already held by believers.From a literary standpoint, there is not much to redeem it. The book is poorly structured, the prose is often tacky and the story is longer than it deserves to be. The reader is constantly assumed to be unintelligent - every metaphor is explained, every connection pointed out, and any potential matter for contemplation is quickly snatched away by exposition. The plot however, for the most part, is engaging. It's basically a story of survival against the odds, and so has all the tension and anticipation you'd expect. The narrator does possess some humour and charm, however the story seems to get lost after a while, and takes a pointless detour or two towards the end. But overall it's entertaining enough to keep you reading.The ending is clever and surprising, and it casts the preceding story in a new light. But in some ways it also seems to undermine what has been developed. There is an implied lesson here about the truth being what you want it to be, which I don't agree with: the truth is what it is regardless of your attitude towards it. You can choose to deny reality and make up a less troubling version for yourself, but that's not a good choice in my opinion. Maybe that's why I didn't find the book's message all that convincing.",48,0.7926,0.12,0.734,0.146,0.5431573802541544,NEGATIVE,1.0

Richard Parker, a Bengali tiger who survives along with Pi is intense, subliminal yet authoritative in claiming his share despite being caught in the life and death situation. Pi is confused, irritated, tormented but determined to get to his destination. Despite losing all his family and animals which he dearly loved and adored, he keeps going strong through each obstacle and learning all the way. One thing which helped him survive was his way of dealing with time, he forgot the very notion of it so time didn’t matter much. Hence he was able to survive for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean, equal to over seven months. One thing which held importance in Pi’s life was the closure of things as it helped him let go off things.

My kid's book club picked this for their May meeting, and the parents are reading it as well. Going to do a dinner-discussion, then screen the movie in 3D! There shall be pizza pi and apple pi served!I cannot imagine there are very many readers out there who have not sunk their teeth into Life of Pi, but perhaps having viewed the movie at some point, there are those that think they've already consumed the whole tale. No - not so.While the movie version was absolutely excellent, the allegory about life itself can't be condensed like a can of soup. Do viewers consider the why behind Pi's name? Pi is infinite with no beginning or end. We hear about alpha and omega in training animals, but if the boy - in order to survive - has a tiger within him, he is both. The story is Life of Pi; not THE Life of Pi because it is all our story if we let it be.If all religious dogma has at heart only the concept of love, then taking a leap of faith makes no difference with religious preference. When Pi, a vegetarian since birth, has become animalistic in tearing apart live turtles and fish, when he is at the end of his life (or so he believes), he faces his sins and turns away from them. The 'Frenchman' who has killed a woman and a man but who is later killed by Richard Parker - in order to save Pi - is merely Pi's hallucinatory facing of a memory. It is his confession before dying...until the carnivorous island miraculously appears.The island full of sustenance but with no solid roots symbolizes food and luxury and slothfulness - the things that can make one feel full and sated...but will kill your soul in the end. When Pi cleans the lifeboat, he removes a human skeleton as well as animal. Who did the killing? Is Pi also Richard Parker? Or did the tiger really kill another castaway in a boat? Such fantastic allegory!I realize that the original concept of a boy stuck on a life raft came from an earlier work by a Brazilian author. If I were to write a book about a rooster sitting atop the back of a cat resting upon a dog who is riding a donkey, it would not imply theft.

My reason for reading it now is that The Mookse and The Gripes group is reading the 2002 Booker shortlist, and this is one of the few winners I had never read. My reluctance to read it before was simplistic and based on my aversion to fantasy and adventure stories.The core of the tale is familiar thanks to the film - a survival story told by a 16 year old Indian boy who is the sole survivor of the wreck of a cargo ship in the Pacific. He claims to have survived despite sharing his raft with a healthy adult tiger, but that is my no means the only implausible element of the tale. In some ways the opening section, in which Pi (or Piscine Molitor Patel to use his full name) relates his childhood in the south Indian French port of Pondicherry as the child of the zookeeper, is the most interesting. There is plenty of humour, particularly when he relates his simultaneous attempts to be a Hindu, a Muslim and a Catholic. Faith plays a big part in the story. Pi ascribes his survival to the will of God. He learns how to fish and to train the tiger to respect his territory, and in a bizarre interlude they find themselves on a floating island formed of algae and populated by meerkats. The final part of the book relates Pi's experiences after reading Mexico, as he is interrogated by two Japanese representatives of the company that owned the lost ship. Needless to say, they are sceptical of his account, and eventually (view spoiler)[they persuade him to relate an alternative version of the story in which his brother and mother also survive the initial shipwreck along with the ships's barbaric French cook, a bloodthirsty tale of murder and cannibalism. So Martel effectively asks us to choose between two different versions of the story, making Pi the ultimate unreliable narrator.

52,2543946794,10/05/2018,5.0,"I'd been planning to read Life of Pi for a few years now but never got around to it. I had this impression that it was about someone trapped alone on an island and I found that to be a bit boring. Fortunately I was dead wrong and this has been such a powerfully poignant and meaningful read.   ""The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no? Doesn't that make life a story?""   I don't want to talk about the plot because I went in completely blind and it was much better than if I had known what exactly this book was about. I'd believed certain things that were not very clear at first, (view spoiler)[ like who Richard Parker was,  (hide spoiler)] and it was a shock to realize the truth, so I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. From the very beginning the writing captured me. I simply loved it, and even had the story been boring -which it wasn't- I would've continued reading for the sake of the writing itself. It was excellent! Here's an example:  ""I enjoyed my meal as I watched the sun's descent in a cloudless sky. It was a relaxing moment. The vault of the world was magnificently tinted. The stars were eager to participate; hardly had the blanket of colour been pulled a little than they started to shine through the deep blue. The wind blew with a faint, warm breeze and the sea moved about kindly, the water peaking and troughing like people dancing in a circle who come together and raise their hands and move apart and come together again, over and over.""  And others:(view spoiler)[  ""So while I, who wouldn't think of pinching a tiger's paw, let alone of trying to swallow one, received a volcanic roar full in the face and quaked and trembled and turned liquid with fear and collapsed, the shark perceived only a dull vibration."" ""Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, a free act of love—but sometimes it was so hard to love. Sometimes my heart was sinking so fast with anger, desolation and weariness, I was afraid it would sink to the very bottom of the Pacific and I would not be able to lift it back up.""""...Oh, look. Speak of the devil. There he is. He's yawning. My, my, what an enormous pink cave. Look at those long yellow stalactites and stalagmites. Maybe today you'll get a chance to visit.""  (hide spoiler)] The story is brutal. The author has weaved fantasy into its fabric very subtly that I had to pause a bit to understand whether I'd read something wrong or whether this or that had actually happened. (view spoiler)[ What part was hallucination and delirium and what part was real *I'm talking about you, fellow blind Frenchman*  (hide spoiler)]. I loved that. Another point relating to the brutality of this novel was the realization that we can talk about morals all we like but when push comes to shove, we'd do anything to save our lives in the face of impending doom. Necessity is the mother of all. "" But in point of fact the explanation lies elsewhere. It is simple and brutal: a person can get used to anything, even to killing.""  I felt so deeply grateful for sitting comfortably at home, with plenty of water and food. We are so accustomed to having the basics of life always at hand that we forget how everything we are would crumble without one of them. (view spoiler)[ As someone who doesn't eat animals or their products, I was in deep anguish over what Pi had to do to survive. But I hold no illusions as to what I would've done were I in his shoes. It was just so heartbreaking to read about it in such detail. I'm grateful though. It has reminded me that when it's a battle for survival, you do what you have to do. Simple as that.  ""I broke its neck by leveraging its head backwards, one hand pushing up the beak, the other holding the neck. The feathers were so well attached that when I started pulling them out, skin came off—I was not plucking the bird; I was tearing it apart. It was light enough as it was, a volume with no weight. I took the knife and skinned it instead. For its size there was a disappointing amount of flesh, only a little on its chest. It had a more chewy texture than dorado flesh, but I didn't find there was much of a difference in taste. In its stomach, besides the morsel of dorado I had just given it, I found three small fish. After rinsing them of digestive juices, I ate them. I ate the bird's heart, liver and lungs. I swallowed its eyes and tongue with a gulp of water. I crashed its head and picked out its small brain. I ate the webbings of its feet. The rest of the bird was skin, bone and feathers.  (hide spoiler)] The ending was brilliant in its idea. I had my jaw hanging open through the last 30 pages or so. (view spoiler)[ I loved that the author left the choice of which story to believe up to the reader. And while the 2nd story is most likely the real one because it's more  realistic,  I personally can't bring myself to accept it. It doesn't explain everything Pi has experienced, and I've grown fond of Richard Parker. I was SO GLAD when he made it in the end, as it's been a constant worry of mine that he'd have to die at some point. I had to look up the ending on the internet to know for sure, but I came up empty-handed. It seems that, as this is a story that would make you believe in God, the message is that whether you'd  choose to believe  in Pi and the story he'd been telling all along, like people choose to believe in the existence of a supreme being; or whether you'd be a realist and accept the 2nd story, with all its horror, and consider Pi's story some sort of coping mechanism with what he went through.  (hide spoiler)]Pi's hardships could also be a symbol for the pain and heartbreak and suffering we go through in life, and here the message is clear: no matter how hard it is, there is always hope. And this, above anything else, is what I'll take away from this book.  Hope is what keeps us alive. ",42,0.8804,0.13,0.734,0.136,0.5288770143165747,POSITIVE,0.9989

58,89845848,02/15/2010,5.0,"HOLY TALKING MUSHROOMS. This book was just ... fantastic. It was the kind of book that I finished reading and then, I could only sit there for a minute like, ""Whooaaa ..."" And it was on my mind for days afterward. Just thinking about it now makes me feel all tingly inside.Before I review a book, I always look at others' reviews––in case someone makes a point I hadn't thought about, or there was something I was going to say but I forgot and need a reminder, etc. And, WOW. I see this is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it type book. Looks like everyone either gives it one star or five stars.And I know I loved a book when the one-star reviews kind of infuriate me. Usually I'm rather indifferent to what other people say about a book; after all, everyone's entitled to their own opinion. But seeing a lot of the negative reviews of this book, I had the impulse to write the old-time trollish comment, ""YOU MISSED THE POINT, YOU FOOL!"" But, I restrained myself. I get it ... I understand how this is not the book for everyone. It's heavy on religious themes, it's graphic, it's depressing, it's not action-packed, it's surreal, it's confusing, and the writing style is a bit unusual. But personally, I found it to be quite the haunting and compelling tale.Here's the story:Piscine ""Pi"" Patel is a boy who grew up in his family's zoo. From a young age, his father has taught him that all animals––even the smallest ones––can be deadly. ""Life will defend itself no matter how small it is,"" he says. ""Every animal is ferocious and dangerous."" Pi never forgets his father's lessons. Meanwhile, as he grows older, he becomes very curious about religion, and finds himself unable to devote himself to one exclusively––all he knows is that he loves God, in whatever form God exists. Despite criticism from family and friends, he refuses to stop practicing multiple religions.Then, when Pi is sixteen, his family is to move their zoo from India to Canada. On the journey, their cargo ship sinks. Pi, the only human survivor, is left on a lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra, and a Bengal tiger.As one can imagine, violence and tension ensues. Soon only Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger) are left. (And don't tell me I'm spoiling the book ... I mean, look at the cover. There's only a kid and a tiger on it.) The majority of the book is about their survival and the twisted relationship between them.What I thought:On the surface, this is a great survival story. I grew up loving books like Island of the Blue Dolphins and Julie of the Wolves ... Stories where one person is forced to survive, only in the company of animals. So, I guess this was a more adult version of that type of story. I'm always fascinated by tales of people who survive even when all the odds are against them. Even if the story isn't true, it's a theme that appeals to me. It's also interesting how Yann Martel seems to imply that people are no better than animals––because no matter what species you are, you're born with the will to survive. Pi and all the animals on the lifeboat have one thing in common: they all want to live. And if it means killing each other, so be it. Another fascinating aspect of the story is Pi's relationship with Richard Parker. Even though the tiger is a danger to him, Pi is determined to keep Richard Parker alive and ""tame"" him. This self-assigned task is the only thing keeping him from falling into despair, from remembering his family is dead and from giving up hope.Now, I'm not a religious person. But I found the religious themes in the book very interesting. I define myself as agnostic ... and the author seems to have a problem with agnosticism, even more than he has problems with atheism. (Or at least, Pi has problems with it. I don't know about the author's beliefs.) He claims that agnostics live ""in doubt"" and miss the point of life or something ... Uhhhh. I would have to argue with him on that. But anyway, that's not the point. The point is, Martel brings up some interesting questions. Why can religions not exist in harmony? Why is one view of God right while the other is wrong?In the author's note, he says the man who told him this story said it would ""make him believe in God"", which is interesting. Throughout the story, it doesn't seem as if Pi loses his faith, despite the horrible circumstances. I saw comments from some reviewers that they thought this was supposed to be ironic, and therefore making fun of religion ... but I didn't feel that way about it. After all, Pi survives. (Once again, don't tell me I'm spoiling, because you find out he survives pretty early on in the story.) And could that not be considered miraculous? Anyway, point is, I thought the book was neither preachy nor making fun of religion, but merely presenting questions about the way everyone views God. Whether Pi's survival is a miracle or a coincidence, it is up for the reader to decide.This brings up something important, which is the very end of the book. I don't want to give anything too specific away, but let's say, it has a bit of a twist at the end. In the end, Pi is interviewed by two men who don't believe his story. So, he tells them an alternate story that doesn't involve the animals. Here's a bit of their conversation:""The Tsimtsum sank on July 2nd, 1977.""""Yes.""""And I arived on the coast of Mexico, the sole human survivor of the Tsimtsum on February 14th, 1978.""""That's right.""""I told you two stories that account for the 277 days in between.""""Yes, you did.""""Neither explains the sinking of the Tsitsum.""""That's right.""""Neither makes a factual difference to you.""""That's true.""""You can't prove which story is true and which is not. You must take my word for it.""""I guess so.""""In both stories the ship sinks, my entire family dies, and I suffer.""""Yes, that's true.""""So tell me ... which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with the animals or the story without animals?"" ...""The story with animals is the better story.""""Thank you. And so it goes with God.""This one little snippet kept me thinking for a long time. At first I didn't really understand what it meant, but after thinking for a while, I assume the author's statement was that all faith is blind––and in choosing our religions, we simply choose the story that appeals to us the most. We can't change what happens to us, and we can't prove that any one religion is true, but we can choose which one we practice based on what we find the most interesting. Anyway, I realize I'm starting to make this book sound a bit heavy. And it is, but it's not all about religion. It also has a lot of humor in it, despite it being such a dark story. I didn't expect it to be such a funny book, but many parts had me laughing out loud––sometimes out of disgust, but mostly because the author says things in such a funny way. One part that particularly stands out to me is a part when Pi pees into a vial on the lifeboat and––in a thirsty craze––briefly considers drinking it. He says, ""Mockery be damned, my urine looked delicious!"" And for some reason, that sent me into a hysterical laughing fit. Maybe I'm juvenile, but really ... that's quite hilarious. Well, I guess that's about all I have to say. This book is brilliant, funny, thought-provoking, exciting, tense, well-written, original ... It blew my mind. Ask anyone in my family ... I couldn't shut up about this book. Go read it!",31,0.9981,0.083,0.776,0.141,0.5328735965931087,NEGATIVE,0.9904
59,7061338,09/30/2007,,"Life of Pi is a wonder.It is the story of a boy of sixteen who is stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger. It is a tale of survival and man’s interaction with himself and the wild. It is a lesson in zoology and spirituality. And it is just plain great.Part fable, part allegory, part memoir, part encyclopedia, and part philosophical text—Life of Pi is all of these things. But most of all, it is a story. And it reads like old-fashioned storytelling—the kind in which a circle of boys and girls sit cross-legged and rapt around an old man who, despite his calm demeanor and soft tones, fiercely commands the room’s attention. In this case, the story he tells is mysterious and wondrous. It is unlike anything anyone has ever heard. And so the children’s parents linger around the outside of the circle, noting the teller’s words and sensing that something is percolating deep beneath the characters and the action, something that, with a knowing glint and a rare hint, the storyteller suggests but doesn’t let on entirely, some moral or truth, or maybe some insight into the human condition. This teller is good. He has no use for guile, and so his clarity of thought and his simplicity of narration draw his listeners in. He has come to understand life’s essential elements, and so he unfolds his story plainly and without artifice. His listeners, in their complexity, are helpless against his honesty.And so, a story—a truly sensational and dramatic story built around an often-bloody struggle for life and death—arrives in a voice that is even, measured, paced, scaled. And this voice opens the doors for everything else that is packed in: the vivid aquatic scenes, the reflections on human need and vice, the range and import of zoological understanding. Faced with all this, the boys and girls and mothers and fathers learn and wonder, and perhaps some of them become aware that this man is not just a storyteller, but truly also a teacher, and that everything he describes—every quandary, every explanation, every detail, every revelation—everything serves to teach something more than the story of a boy and a tiger…Do I recommend it? Absolutely. Thoughtful, fun, full of stuff.Would I teach it? Yes, I think so. There’s a lot to work with in there.Lasting impressions: Aside from some tremendous plot revelations, two things stand out to me: voice and story. There’s something about the simplicity of the voice that reminds me of The God of Small Things and I wonder if it has to do with Indian culture. And then there’s just the great storytelling.

Their ship, the Mignonette, had gone down in a storm, and they had escaped to the lifeboat, with only two cans of preserved turnips and no fresh water. Thomas Dudley was the captain, Edwin Stephens was the first mate, and Edmund Brooks was a sailor—“all men of excellent character,” according to newspaper accounts.The fourth member of the crew was the cabin boy, Richard Parker, age seventeen. He was an orphan, on his first long voyage at sea. He had signed up against the advice of his friends, “in the hopefulness of youthful ambition,” thinking the journey would make a man of him. Sadly, it was not to be.From the lifeboat, the four stranded sailors watched the horizon, hoping a ship might pass and rescue them. For the first three days, they ate small rations of turnips. On the fourth day, they caught a turtle. They subsisted on the turtle and the remaining turnips for the next few days. And then for eight days, they ate nothing.By now Parker, the cabin boy, was lying in the corner of the lifeboat. He had drunk seawater, against the advice of the others, and become ill. He appeared to be dying. On the nineteenth day of their ordeal, Dudley, the captain, suggested drawing lots to determine who would die so that the others might live. But Brooks refused, and no lots were drawn.The next day came, and still no ship was in sight. Dudley told Brooks to avert his gaze and motioned to Stephens that Parker had to be killed. Dudley offered a prayer, told the boy his time had come, and then killed him with a penknife, stabbing him in the jugular vein. Brooks emerged from his conscientious objection to share in the gruesome bounty. For four days, the three men fed on the body and blood of the cabin boy.And then help came. Dudley describes their rescue in his diary, with staggering euphemism: “On the 24th day, as we were having our breakfast,” a ship appeared at last. The three survivors were picked up. Upon their return to England, they were arrested and tried. Brooks turned state’s witness. Dudley and Stephens went to trial. They freely confessed that they had killed and eaten Parker.

62,25421728,06/25/2008,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, the second half of this story, when Pi is trapped in a lifeboat with an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra, and a tiger in the middle of the ocean and has to survive after the tiger kills all the other animals, is fascinating. (and no, that does not count as a spoiler, because the back of the book tells you the exact same thing.)On the other hand, nearly everything that happens before the boat crash that leads to Pi's lifeboat problem is incredibly, mind-numbingly boring. I liked learning about zoology and the inner workings and secrets of zoos that Pi's father reveals, and the information was important to later plot developements. But then Pi spends at least four long chapters describing how he decided as a teenager that he was going to be Christian, Muslim, and Hindu all at the same time. (He may have dabbled in Judaism as well, but I honestly can't remember if he did or not because by that point in the book I was ready to throw the thing out the window) I realize that Pi's faith is an important factor during his time in the lifeboat, but it just takes so damn long for him to lecture the readers on his multi-road faith journey. I remember reading it and wondering when he was going to be in the damn shipwreck already. And the ending...at the risk of giving anything away, I'll just say that it's one of those endings that makes you go, ""Wait...what?"" After I finished the book, I felt like Yann Martel was ordering me to reread the book and observe all his oh-so-brilliant symbolism etc etc. But then I remembered the first half of the book and I was like, ""Screw you, Yann Martel.

I'm obviously not an expert on Classics but I believe this is exactly what a classic is supposed to make you feel. “Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can.” I definitely do not recommend watching the movie before reading this. The movie is okay but this book brings so much more to the table. Plus the movie removed one of my favorite scenes soo...“You might think I lost all hope at that point. I did.

Subject, verb. Subject, verb. This was not one of those “craft mirrors content” things—the monotony of the ocean and the repetition as representative of the day after day afloat on wave after wave. How do I know? I know because the writing was not good enough to be a “craft mirrors content” thing. You might be asking yourself why I think the writing wasn’t good enough. There are many reasons (including the invasive/disruptive suppositions of what the reader is likely thinking).First, there are the dazzling clichés. “It seemed the presence of the tiger had saved me from a hyena—surely a textbook example of jumping from the frying pan into the fire” (172). “How true it is that necessity is the mother of invention” (175). “You must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it” (115). Then there is the author’s strange fetish for figurative language involving volcanoes. “The laughter was like a volcano of happiness erupting in me” (153). “It had a two-foot-wide hole in its body, a fistula like a freshly erupted volcano” (161). “I felt I was climbing the side of a volcano and I was about to look over the rim into a boiling cauldron of orange lava” (171). “So while I, who wouldn’t think of pinching a tiger’s paw, let alone of trying to swallow one, received a volcanic roar full in the face and quaked a trembled” (278). “There would emerge a short distance away three or four [whales], a short-lived archipelago of volcanic islands” (290).In the above examples, look how close some of the page numbers are. That emphasizes not that there were only a few bad pages, but that you can’t turn the damn page without being assaulted by tripe. Of course I can’t forget the actual story. On page 121, the second section of the book opens with “The ship sank.” Good. Now cut out the preceding 120 pages. They are unnecessary, boring, and infuriating. Why infuriating? First because of the sermonizing. Oh, fifteen-year-old Pi Patel, you are so wise in your acceptance three major faiths that you can open the eyes of the holy men of each faith. Oh, fifteen-year-old Pi Patel, how wise of you to explain that “it is on the inside that God muse be defended, not on the outside…For evil in the open is but evil from within let out” (90) and other profound postulations. (This may sound like the bitter complaints of an atheist criticizing a book just because it mentions God; it’s not, I assure you. I’m an atheist who has no problem reading religious texts or about religious characters. It’s the sermonizing that gets me.) While I can live with illogical arguments espoused in religion, the rhetoric used to defend the existence of zoos is what was really infuriating. I’ve never really given much thought to the morality of zoos. I suppose, had I to decide, I would say that confining animals is more wrong than right, but I’m far from starting a protest outside the monkey cages—I’d rather watch those crazy monkeys swing around in their faux habitat. I won’t rehash all of Pi’s idiotic claims about why animals love zoos (just read the beginning of the book, notably chapter 4), but I will scream “Fallacy! Fallacy!” to each of his points. Again, it’s not the actual issue I care about; rather, it’s the abysmally half-witted logic used to defend the issue.The plot doesn’t redeem the writing any. I planned to rant and rave over certain absolute absurdities (a man-eating island, a random bought of blindness precisely when another blind castaway should appear), but the end of the book precludes my making that long rant. In fact, the final 25 pages or so were the most enjoyable.The characterization stinks. I did not care what happened to Pi at all. In fact, I was hoping Richard Parker would eat his dumb-ass just to end this four hundred page stinker sooner. Pi elicits no emotional connection. When he expresses some emotion, it is clunky and mechanical (due, in part, to the simplistic prose and complete lack of transition). For a book like this to work—a book centered entirely on one (human) character—the reader needs to really care about that character. That character needs to come alive. I suppose I can’t even say I wish Pi had died because for me he was never alive to begin with. I cared more about Tom Hanks’s inanimate buddy Wilson than I did about Pi or Richard Parker.Finally, maybe I’ve been reading too much Perec and have developed high expectations for carefully crafted structure. Because for me, the following is nearly too stupid for words: “Where we can, we must give things a meaningful shape. For example—I wonder—could you tell my jumbled story in exactly one hundred chapters, not one more, not one less?” (360). Why is that so bad? Because it’s in chapter 94! This is the first time giving “meaningful shape” is mentioned. The first time! In chapter 94! How f*ing hard is it at this point to bang out another six chapters?! Especially when any given chapter can pretty much be broken into two or combined with others at a whim! It’s like Yann Martel realized “Holy shit, I’m on chapter 94 already. Hmmm…maybe I’ll make this an even 100 chapters and blow people’s minds. I’m a freakin’ genius!” That’s it. I’m getting too upset just writing about this shipwreck of a novel.

Escape is basically aims to entertain while interpretative is written to broaden and deepen and sharpen our awareness of life. Whenever I add a book in Goodreads, I normally browse at the different comments from my friends and other Goodreads users who have read the book already. I have now around 600 books in my possession waiting to be read. I also make sure that I finish what I started. So, deciding what's next becomes quite a decision for me. When I said I would read Life of Pi next, I was relying on the positive comments of my Goodreads friends and based on their comments it is more of interpretative literature (which I prefer) rather than escape.The story started out well and it has one of the most interesting premise that even makes Ernest Hemingway's 
The Old Man and the Sea
 seems like a mediocre (and not a well-loved classic) novel. Imagine a 16 y/o boy surviving in a lifeboat afloat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean for 227 days with a royal Bengal tiger? Then the boy was a practicing Hindu, Catholic and Muslim religions so you have the elements of an interpretative literature thrown in.However, towards the last few pages of the book, Yann spoiled the fun by introducing the animal-less version of the story. Of course, I share the view of the Japanese interviewers that the one with animals is the more interesting one and up to the last page I was hoping that it will be proven as the actual story. But we know that it is not.Then comes the entry in the Wikipedia saying that there was a Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar who claimed to have previously used plot in his novel of a protagonist crossing Atlantic Ocean sharing a boat with a jaguar. First Scliar threatened to sue but after talking to Yann, he did not push through with it. Later, in Yann's Author's Note of Life of Pi, he dedicated the novel to Scliar. We all know that this happens. A few years back there was also another author suing Dan Brown for The Da Vinci Code. But this leaves bad taste on the author-being-sued's mouth.Overall though, given that I enjoyed reading this 400-page escapist book, I really liked it. It almost made a five star if not because of that twist at the end. I am also not yet lining up other Yann's novels in my bookshelves yet. Could it be that this book being a product of plagiarism is just a flash in a pan for Yann?

74,1515683957,01/18/2016,5.0,"""Life of Pi"" is a classic text that yielded even richer rewards for me on my second reading of it. It is easily in my top five favorite books of all time. The reason is very simple. Yann Martel has written a work that is quite engrossing and interesting on two levels: the literal, and the much more satisfying metaphorical.I first read ""Life of Pi"" three years ago. I reread it recently because it was a book club choice. Although this novel carved out a niche in my brain on that first reading, I found even more to appreciate and digest during my second.This allegorical novel explores many themes so fundamental to human existence. Faith, religion, storytelling, survival, love, companionship, etc. Not only does ""Life of Pi"" explore these themes, it sheds new light on these very overdone topics. That is not easily done. For Mr. Martel to take such universal themes that have been written and discussed a million times over, and make them fresh and new is a testament to his own prowess as a thinker and a writer.Mr. Martel's writing is also rarely didactic, and his use of figurative language is at times breathtakingly beautiful. As one who enjoys good writing, and am impressed by those who have such tight control of style and language I was not disappointed in that aspect of this text. Too many good storytellers are not good writers. Mr. Martel thankfully does not fall into that categoryTo not read this book with an open and inquiring mind is to miss ""the better story"", regardless of what you make that out to be. As I read the text I found and saw a very heavily Christian influence in the book's events and themes. It is just as conceivable that someone else could read it, and see none of those things. What is so wonderful is that both points of view can be defended from the text.One critic talked about how this novel makes one believe in the ""soul sustaining power of fiction."" ""Life of Pi"" lives up to that praise.Read this text and enjoy one of the few modern novels that gives the reader a real chance to ""explore"".",26,0.9971,0.009,0.794,0.197,0.5183501683501684,POSITIVE,0.9998

A movie was made of the novel because, on the surface, the story is a terrifying adventure of endurance and survival. Below is a link to a movie trailer. https://youtu.be/5GbXVo9DdZoThe movie had mixed reviews, frankly.The outline of the book's plot is as follows: Piscine (Pi) Molitor Patel, when a boy of 16, was on a freighter which was taking his family - Father, Mother and older brother Ravi - to Canada from India. The secular Patels had decided to emigrate because of a political situation going on in India which had made things uncomfortable for the family. In the hold of the ship - the Tsimtzum - were the animals which had been sold from the Pondicherry Zoo, which had been owned and managed by Pi's father. There were caged monkeys, tigers, zebras, and hyenas. Without warning, a storm came and sank the ship. Pi finds himself alone somewhere in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat. Well, not alone, exactly. Looking about him, he discovers a zebra with a broken leg, an orangutan he had known as a lovable animal since he was a little boy, a hyena - and a semi-wild 450-pound tiger called Richard Parker. Things are very dire, no joke. However, Pi has always had faith in God. All of the gods, actually. Since he was 14 years old. Ever since he first saw an animal kill and eat another animal, Pi has always been a bit nervous about life and death, and eternity and the afterlife and gods.For some reason when Pi was 8 years old and an admirer of the rites and rituals of religious Hinduism (his aunt had introduced him to the religion), his father had taken Ravi and himself to the zoo to watch Mahisha, a tiger, kill and eat a living goat. The purpose had been to keep his boys from anthropomorphizing the animals. Father had been afraid one of the children would stick a hand into a cage and pet them. But watching the tiger killing and eating the goat cured Pi forever. There was a lot of blood and gore. It was horrific.At age 14, Pi discovered there were other places of worship near him beside Hindu temples - Christian churches and Muslim mosques. He began to attend all of them after school (his parents had placed him in a Christian school because they were known as the best schools). He became a fervent believer of all of them, learning the prayers and studying all about the different gods. He became an extremely religious kid. Although mystified, his parents loved him and permitted Pi to pursue his interest. After all, Pi never neglected the things for which he was responsible - taking care of zoo animals, learning to swim, his school work. He was a normal kid with the exception of being a practicing Hindu/Muslim/Christian.Then the disaster of the ship sinking in the storm happened, and Pi is alone in a lifeboat with semi-wild animals, with no land in sight. While the injured zebra lies bleeding near the stern, the hyena is under the tarpaulin which is stretched over the bow and half of the 25-foot boat. Pi is lying on the top of the tarpaulin. Where is the tiger? There are benches around the circumference of the boat, with three seats across the width of the boat. The tiger is under a seat. The orangutan was on a side bench. The traumatized animals, including Pi for the moment, have no thought of food. Then, after some time has passed, the predatory animals begin to kill the vegetarians. Pi, as it happens, is a vegetarian boy of 16, and without any weapons except for the temporary haven of the flexible tarp separating him from the animals. All Pi has is his brain, knowledge of the animals from taking care of them at the zoo, a box of supplies he located under the tarp in the bow of the boat, and his faith. He will need it all. He will be on the boat for the next seven months....I have not spoiled anything as all of the above information is revealed in the early chapters.Just for fun, I googled stuff that seems to be maybe sources for some of the hidden ideas in the novel 'The Life of Pi' .Remember the name of the ship Pi and his family take to begin their immigration to Canada?  Tzimtzum. It turns out this word describes a concept in the Jewish book of the Kabbalah, specifically a Kabbalah version developed by a man called Isaac Luria (1534-1572).. Tzimtzum describes how The Infinite Divine withdraws from reality leaving a space for the finite to be created. Pi was studying Isaac Luria's cosmology theory for his religious studies thesis in college.The author Yann Martel was born in Spain and he studied philosophy in college. The Kabbalah was expanded on famously after an expulsion of Kabbalah thinkers in the 16th century from Spain.Quoted from Wikipedia:""The 16th century renaissance of Kabbalah in the Galilean community of Safed, which included Joseph Karo, Moshe Alshich, Cordovero, Luria and others, was shaped by their particular spiritual and historical outlook. After the 1492 Expulsion from Spain they felt a personal urgency and responsibility on behalf of the Jewish people to hasten Messianic redemption. ""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac...""The tzimtzum or tsimtsum (Hebrew צמצום ṣimṣūm ""contraction/constriction/condensation"") is a term used in the Lurianic Kabbalah to explain Isaac Luria's new doctrine that God began the process of creation by ""contracting"" his Ein Sof (infinite) light in order to allow for a ""conceptual space"" in which finite and seemingly independent realms could exist. This primordial initial contraction, forming a Khalal/Khalal Hapanui (""vacant space"", חלל הפנוי) into which new creative light could beam, is denoted by general reference to the tzimtzum. In contrast to earlier, Medieval Kabbalah, this made the first creative act a concealment/Divine exile rather than unfolding revelation. This dynamic crisis-catharsis in the Divine flow is repeated throughout the Lurianic scheme.Because the tzimtzum results in the ""empty space"" in which spiritual and physical Worlds and ultimately, free will can exist, God is often referred to as ""Ha-Makom"" (המקום lit. ""the Place"", ""the Omnipresent"") in Rabbinic literature (""He is the Place of the World, but the World is not His Place""). In Kabbalistic interpretation, this describes the paradox of simultaneous Divine presence and absence within the vacuum and resultant Creation. Relatedly, Olam — the Hebrew for ""World/Realm"" — is derived from the root עלם meaning ""concealment"". This etymology is complementary with the concept of Tzimtzum in that the subsequent spiritual realms and the ultimate physical universe conceal to different degrees the infinite spiritual lifeforce of creation. Their progressive diminutions of the Divine Ohr (Light) from realm to realm in creation are also referred to in the plural as secondary tzimtzumim (innumerable ""condensations/veilings/constrictions"" of the lifeforce). However, these subsequent concealments are found in earlier, Medieval Kabbalah. The new doctrine of Luria advanced the notion of the primordial withdrawal (a dilug – radical ""leap"") in order to reconcile a causal creative chain from the Infinite with finite Existence.""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzimtzum https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luria...I am going to finish my googling with the word 'Pi' - the nickname of the main character:Quoted from Live Science:""No number can claim more fame than pi. ... Defined as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, pi, or in symbol form, π, seems a simple enough concept. But it turns out to be an ""irrational number,"" meaning its exact value is inherently unknowable...The digits of pi continue their senseless procession all the way to infinity...Ancient mathematicians apparently found the concept of irrationality completely maddening. It struck them as an affront to the omniscience of God, for how could the Almighty know everything if numbers exist that are inherently unknowable?http://www.livescience.com/29197-what...I can't help but wonder why the author is conflating TWO things together consistently throughout the novel because it must mean something since this is a literary novel. What I think: Pi's fear-based obsession with worshiping all of the gods began at the same time as his experience of the tooth and claw of animals. His father took him to the zoo at age 8 where he saw an animal torn apart. (view spoiler)[On the raft and lifeboat, he not only saw a hyena which he thought ugly disembowel a zebra which he had thought beautiful, and he saw a favorite animal he has known most of his life, the orangutan Orange Juice, whom he loved, have her head torn off. (hide spoiler)]He prays and prays and prays and prays hoping there is life after death(view spoiler)[, while seeing animals he likes die and die and die and die and die and die - not to mention the deaths of his family  (hide spoiler)].The surface of the story to some readers has been gee, Pi loves life! Life is affirmed as good because there is a god! Or maybe lots of gods! But I think his obsession with making sure he prays to every god he learns people worship is about a sweaty, bowel-loosing horror he is feeling about the inevitability of Death. I think underlying his fierce determination to worship God in all His masks is a terror of dying. I think he is afraid there is no afterlife for non-believers. It might also be praying to every god in the world is an expression of a desperate anxiety and a lack of certain faith. His heart is full of existential terror, not a glorious religiosity. Speaking to the symbolic and literary side of Pi's adventure, it was a rebirth after undergoing a purification. His past is utterly destroyed, and emptied of all previous notions, connections and history, he is resurrected into a new life. He is the Buddha, the Christ risen, the Sun god. He has bathed symbolically in the holy waters of India's great river, the Ganges, by his boatride across the Pacific. Or perhaps, it is the Greek river Styx, and Richard Parker is Charon. Quote from Wikipedia: ""The name Charon is most often explained as a proper noun from χάρων (charon), a poetic form of χαρωπός (charopós), “of keen gaze”, referring either to fierce, flashing, or feverish eyes, or to eyes of a bluish-gray color. The word may be a euphemism for death. Flashing eyes may indicate the anger or irascibility of Charon as he is often characterized in literature, but the etymology is not certain."" Richard Parker has flashing feverish eyes...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charo...I could go on and on and on, but no. This review is too long as it is. My bad. Read this book, though. I highly recommend it.(view spoiler)[ About that island of the flesh-eating algae....Quoted from Wikipedia:""In Yann Martel's 2001 novel Life of Pi, the protagonist encounters a floating island of carnivorous algae inhabited by meerkats while shipwrecked in the Pacific Ocean.

An Indian boy is stranded with a Bengal tiger, or is he?
I saw this novel not only of reality, but also of the nature of God and religious beliefs. Pi spends his time stranded as a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, and probably others I cannot recall, and in each one he finds himself. I admire how he referred to religious people and atheist as both taking a giant leap of faith. A religious person for their belief in an omnipotent power, and an atheist as a leap that such power does not exist. “It makes no factual difference to you and you can’t prove the question either way, which story do you prefer?” SO we are left wondering which choice to make. Life is a story, a version of the truth, and we choose our lie or “versions” of the truth. “I must say a word about fear. It is life’s only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always … so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it.

Life of Pi is from the first chapter a smooth narrative, really a page turner, full of tension and drama with an occasional touch of humor, dealing with life defining themes but without turning ponderous or preachy.Being a story of a sea voyage it has the added bonus of putting me in touch with my own 16 year old self, the one who dreamed of becoming a sailor and in the meantime read everything from Nansen to Thor Heyerdahl, Columbus to Thomas Cook, Joseph Conrad to Douglass Reeman. Yann Martell's book is as much about the ocean as it is about the fate of Piscine Molitor Patel. Speaking of names, the origin story of his own name, and that for Richard Parker's, are early proofs of Mr. Martell talent as a natural storyteller, easily capturing my attention and pushing me to continue reading.The first chapters of the book are the ones where I made the most notations and bookmarks, and they are vital for understating the later developments. These chapters are also the ones that could prove the most controversial and provocative to certain categories of readers, as they touch on the subject of religion, always a thorny issue, and keeping animals in a zoo, which some consider an abomination. I find myself in agreement with Pi Patel on both subjects. Before moving to Pondicherry, Father ran a large hotel in Madras. An abiding interest in animals led him to the zoo business. A natural transition, you might think, from hotelkeeping to zookeeping. Growing up in Zootown, young Pi had his eyes open early to the wonders (and dangers) of the natural world. He sees the institution as sanctuary, and not as prison for the animals hosted there, a means to educate the public, to study and preserve endangered species: I wish I could convey the perfection of a seal slipping into water or a spider monkey swinging from point to point or a lion merely turning its head. But language founders in such seas. Most of the problems the animals have, in a well run and well funded establishment, come not from the lack of liberty but from the visiting public, and here (chapter four, I think) Pi gives ample examples of how animals can be mistreated and attacked by an insensitive audience. The fences and walls are there mostly to protect the animals and not the people: We commonly say in the trade that the most dangerous animal in a zoo is Man. In a general way we mean how our species' excessive predatoriness has made the entire planet our prey. Pi Patel comes from a modern Indian family, moderately rich, pragmatic and well educated people who are thoroughly baffled when their teenage son develops an uncommon enthusiasm for religion. Not just any simple religion or cult, but a heartfelt, active simultaneous devotion for the Hindu, Christian and Muslim creeds. This is a deliberate choice for Pi, who prefers to search for the things that unite us across cultures and not for those that divide and lead to hatred. Pi has a place in his system even for his favorite zoology teacher, Mr. Kumar, who declames forcefully: There are no grounds for going beyond a scientific explanation of reality and no sound reason for believing anything but our sense experience. A clear intellect, close attention to detail and a little scientific knowledge will expose religion as superstitious bosh. God does not exists. For Pi this ""dry yeastless factuality"" is insufficient, and he goes to religion in search of ""the better story"" , one that would enrich his life and give sense and direction to his yearnings. Martell once again proves his writing chops by capturing in a few lines the essences of these creeds: Brahman saguna is Brahman made manifest to our limited senses, Brahman expressed not only in gods, but in humans, animals, trees, in a handful of earth, for everything has a trace of the divine in it. The truth of life is that Brahman is no different from atman, the spiritual force within us, what you might call the soul. The individual soul touches upon the world soul like a well reaches for the water table. or,  I challenge anyone to understand Islam, its spirit, and not love it. It is a beautiful religion of brotherhood and devotion. The most memorable scene in this first section of the book is the meeting between Pi, his parents and his three religious tutors : the priest, the imam and the guru. They all try to claim exclusive rights over the boy's soul, only to lay bare their rigid dogmas and their intransingence. Pi is forced to admit that religion is a deeply personal experience that has little to do with actual church practices. Like him, I have started with a strictly scientific education and still consider myself an atheist, or pan-religious, refusing to recognize that any of the established churches has the key to the ultimate truth of life. Yet, over the years, I have found the study of the myths and parables associated with religion deeply satisfying and still relevant to ethical and social questions.Zoology and religion will provide Pi with the tools to survive his 227 days of being stranded in a small boat on an immense ocean. Not a spoiler, since we know already that the boy survived to be interviewed by the author years later. Zoology will give him the confidence to understand and dominate the wild animals in his boat. Religion will open his eyes to wonder and will sustain him in facing the extreme hardships of survival at sea. Life on a lifeboat isn't much of a life. It is like the end game in chess, a game with few pieces. The elements couldn't be more simple, nor the stakes higher. Physically it is extraordinarily arduous, and morally it is killing. You must make adjustments if you want to survive. Much becomes expendable. You get your happiness where you can. Far more than the practical details of the constant fight for food, water and shelter, the main attraction, for Pi and for me, is the spectacular diversity and abundance of marine life: I spent more hours than I can count a quiet witness to the highly mannered, manifold expressions of life that grace our planet. It is something so bright, loud, weird and delicate as to stupefy the senses. and again, At moments of wonder, it is easy to avoid small thinking, to entertain thoughts that span the universe, that capture both thunder and tinkle, thick and thin, the near and the far. Death is the constant companion of the voyage, from the need to abandon his Indian vegetarian diet and to actually kill his prospective meal, to the volatile temper of Richard Parker; from the witnessing of a storm from practically at sea level ( The water was shot through with what looked like white roots; briefly, a great celestial tree stood in the ocean. I had never imagined such a thing possible, lightning striking the sea.) to a really disturbing episode (view spoiler)[ that is rather explicitly about cannibalism (hide spoiler)]. Richard Parker, and later a strange floating ecosystem, transcend their physicality to become symbols, parables of the struggle for survival and of nature's balancing act between destruction and creation.Is Piscine Molitor Patel an unreliable narrator? Probably. Does it matter? Not really. Like the religious gospels mentioned earlier, his story is parable and myth and educational. Is it a realistic story? Again, does it matter? In the acknowledgement to the Canada Council for the Arts, who offered the author a grant, he lets us know about his literary credo :  If we citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams.  . Martell has chosen to go for ""the better story"".At one point of his ordeal, Pi exclaims : My greatest wish - other than salvation - was to have a book. A long book with a never-ending story. One I could read again and again, with new eyes and a fresh understanding each time. The greatest compliment to Yann Martell I can think of at the moment, is to declare that he has written such a book, one that I would take with me if I were stranded on a desert island. I would take a whole library with me, actually, but that's another story ...",23,0.9992,0.069,0.779,0.152,0.5013256486243066,NEGATIVE,0.5617
83,2466119996,08/06/2019,5.0,"57th book of 2019.I read this book in a day and although my original review of this book was 4 stars, and I complained of the ending... I have done some more mulling. For the Love of AnimalsI'd say I'm a pretty serious lover of most animals. Insects don't terrify me. I'm not big on reptiles (snakes being one of the few things that scare me), but animals, on the whole, bring me a lot of joy. I have several favourite animals, admittedly: dogs, whales, sloths, parrots, monkeys, elephants, octopuses, tigers... So you can imagine my delight when I knew this book was about a tiger on a boat, and not only that, but found the first few pages are simply about sloths. And not only interesting facts about sloths, but general musings, in Martel's wonderful, quiet writing:I am not one given to projecting human traits and emotions onto animals, but many a time during that month in Brazil, looking up at sloths in repose, I felt I was in the presence of upside-down yogis deep in meditation or hermits deep in prayer, wise beings whose intense imaginative lives were beyond the reach of my scientific probing.I'd say this book is part (metaphorical) ode to the animal kingdom. There is a lot of beauty and appreciation in this book. Who Is Richard Parker?I've never seen the film, but I'm quite aware that its now well known that Life of Pi is about a boy trapped on a boat with a tiger. I'll admit, it's quite the image, quite the poster. Even looking at my edition cover fills me with excitement. A tiger on a boat, with a boy! What a great idea. ""What a stolen idea,"" they say to me. Well, yes. Well, no. Well, I don't know. If you're unaware of the ""plagiarism"" battle that surrounded this novel you can read about it here. There are the same debates about Rowling robbing things for Harry Potter. There seems to be attacks on most writers. So, without opening up a completely separate debate - I move swiftly on. Richard Parker is the 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger. Pi's boat-friend. However, I will say that, 1. They do not begin as boat-friends, certainly not. And 2. He is not his only boat friend, in the beginning. Before I read this book, having only seen the (and they are beautiful looking) stills from the movie of boy and tiger. But yes, Pi is also graced with having a hyena, a zebra and a female orangutan on his boat, too. Now this book is classed as a fantasy. The sceptics like to yelp about the unrealistic nature of the plot. ""The tiger would just eat the boy."" Yes, congratulations, a valid point, if this were a 'realistic' book. Which it is not. That's not to say it isn't believable. The relationship between Pi and Richard Parker is very believable in the scope of the story. In the same way we believe in the Ents in Lord of the Rings, and we believe that men can talk to cats in Murakami. Avoiding the debate aforementioned, then, this book is everything Atwood claimed it to be: A terrific book...Fresh, original, smart, devious, and crammed with absorbing lore. The latter I have mentioned and will mention again, the richness of Martel's writing on animals was stellar, and unlike anything I've read in fiction before. It's partly wrong to compare it to Moby Dick, but in a way, it is comparable to Moby Dick. I'll have to ponder that one some more. The ending of the book left me cheated. There is a whole part of the book that goes off into the realm of fantasy a little too much, and disbelief does begin to roll in. So ultimately, that means the book is flawed, no? I haven't re-read this, though I would like to one day. But as it stands in my mind (because it does, it often stands in my mind at the front of the crowd, or else it is tall, so can be seen from wherever it stands) the ending has grown on me. Maybe I am now realising it isn't a cheat. It's the classic ""leave it up to the reader"" ending. My original review of this referred it to as a ""I woke up and it was all a dream""-like ending, which I now consider unfair. Open to the reader - does that mean the writer has been lazy? Couldn't pick how to end it so just threw the half-dead body to us so we can decide, is it dead or alive? (A metaphor, no one is left half-dead at the end). Open to the reader is now proving to me that just lets it sit for a little while longer in the mind. This book returns to me, and it returns to me, amazingly as I have not seen the film, but in stills, in images, because of Martel's vivid language. A Kingdom in a BookLife of Pi is one of the books that I look at and marvel how so much is held in so little. A 300 page paperback, that's all it is. A single day of my life, is all it took. I'd go as far to say I haven't looked at tigers in the same way since. Maybe that's one of my reasons for ignoring the Internet's sensationalism around Tiger King. You could argue I'm not watching it because it's ""popular"", well maybe, but I'll stick with saying, no - it's because of Richard Parker.Richard Parker is my Tiger King, ladies and gentlemen.",23,0.9954,0.079,0.789,0.133,0.5162276785714284,POSITIVE,0.985

85,1418732784,01/17/2018,2.0,"I have been yearning to read this book for a long time. Everyone I spoke to was obsessed with this book to the n-th degree, so I figured I might feel the same way once I read it. I was highly mistaken.I found this book to be slow moving and boring, even though it is well written. This book was just not for me (which happens, by the way. Not every reader has to like every book ever written). That being said, I still wanted to give it a quality review. For me, the stars are low - but keep in mind this book is still excellent and the idea was intriguing.To keep the plot short: A boy is trapped on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger after his family was trying to move their zoo animals across the sea. Tragedy strikes, and now Pi (our lead) is stuck with Richard Parker (our cat). I found that this story went in many different directions. At first, this story seemed to be all about animals and how Pi's father ran a zoo. I thought there might be more information in regards to him opening a zoo in the future, or having some great story arc involving it. Unfortunately, this didn't go very far. It seemed to just be an introduction into the character rather than making it an integral part of the story (except for the animals on the lifeboat, of course). Then religion is thrown into the mix!! Pi enjoys practicing three different religions and this causes strife with his family, and then the plot point is essentially gone. There could have been lots of room for improvement in this discussion further along in the book, but all we get is that Pi is ""praying"" a lot. To me, having all of these opportunities to follow through with these plot lines was a bit of a waste. Why just have these points as an intro to the character? Why not use them to your advantage?I also found this book to be SO FREAKING SLOW AND BORING. It's inspirational, but when it's close to two hundred pages of ""stuck on a boat, send help, I am praying, there's a tiger, i need to drink water"" over and over, it gets a little tiring. When I look at other reviews and theories about this book, I understand the theme is about religion. You can pick your story to follow God - just like picking apart this book. There's multiple stories to follow, and you can pick the one you like. I don't know how I feel about this theme and the way it is presented, but it worked.This book also has some gore in it, so if you don't want to read about an animal being ripped apart in description then this book might not be for you!!Pros:1. The chapters are short - I like when books don't make long chapters. Having a chapter that lasts one hundred pages tires me out. Having the opportunity to stop where I want to with a small chapter is a nice quality about this book.2. The cover - The cover is absolutely gorgeous. It's simple, it's colourful and it gets to the point. I appreciate a well thought out cover.3. Beautiful language - Yann Martel can present a scene well with his words. There are some moments in this book where I got lost in his choice of words.Cons:1. Slow and Steady doesn't always win the race.2. Religion. This seems like a bad place to put it, but I know many people who would lose their minds having religion be a theme in the book (some would have it as an AMAZING PRO). That being said, I'm putting it in cons because of the strife it may cause some readers. There's also times I think that religion was mentioned to much, like the author was trying to hit us over the head with it. Just because you leave religion out for one page doesn't mean we'll forget about it! 3. The story drags with the same thoughts and concepts.Overall, this book was not my cup of tea. It is beautifully written and was a unique take on religion I hadn't seen before. I had high hopes and expectations for this book, but it didn't bode well for me. I blame a lot of the really great reviews and everyone saying it was the best book ever to make me have such high expectations, but putting the blame on them really won't get me anywhere, will it?Two out of five stars.",22,0.995,0.084,0.778,0.139,0.5304649595687331,NEGATIVE,1.0
86,424815731,09/30/2012,3.0,"One of those books for which you feel almost nothing. It's neither poignant nor heart-warming, neither shocking nor horrifying. It just messily clubs together a whole lot of zoological and botanical information, some fine imagery along with a survivor story and lofty ideas about faith. It is easy to see that Life of Pi is a deeply allegorical novel but the message received at the end is neither loud nor clear. Through Pi's story of survival(literal and otherwise), the author tries to reinforce his own opinions on religion and faith. But this is not done with a tremendous amount of conviction since I wasn't exactly blown away by the writer's sky-high assertions. Further, my enjoyment of the novel was curtailed somewhat by the fact I had to peel off several layers of the story to get to the core of it. I think I would've been able to appreciate the book more, had it been just an adventurous story of survival and an unlikely bond between a boy and a feline that forms in the face of disaster. The only impression I was able to form about this book is that the narrator got carried away in his earnest attempts at creating a most original style of fiction or trying to beget something really unique and ended up sounding dubious instead. While the writer goes on and on about hanging on to faith, the reader remains largely unaffected. So this book would remain in my memories as a sort of a compilation of moments rather than a great story I read. It does shine here and there and show sparks of brilliance sporadically, but overall it loses out when it comes to leaving a permanent impression.",22,0.9917,0.047,0.768,0.185,0.5764367816091954,NEGATIVE,1.0

Yes, I'm sure it's a great piece of literature that those who are more into ""literary college fiction"" and less into so-called ""genre fiction"" enjoy immensely.For me it failed in three major ways.1) When I read I like to get sucked into the world. I don't want to constantly be reminded that I'm sitting in a location reading. I want to be with the characters. This book kept me at a distance.2) The book was written like a dissertation. Yes, there were good turns of phrase, but it was too self-conscious about the turns of phrase. It seemed to stop every two sentences to put a big line under how clever the author was being here. That plus the condescending tone of the aforementioned dissertationess insulted me greatly.3) The author hates atheists. His main character hates atheists. The whole first part of the book involves the character whining about straw atheists, finding straw atheists and then failing to defeat straw atheists by any measure other than the author's inept rubric. Yelling what is essentially ""But God! Atheist bad! God!"" does not constitute an argument. I'm not atheist, but I know enough atheists to be offended on their behalf about shit like this. If I wanted to see a pathetic atheist hater imagine a world where their inept arguments carried the day and they totally got to Mary Sue and laugh along with their character I'd have read the Left Behind books.Beyond that, I say if you hate atheists and want a well written book of Mary Sueism and literature quality musings on life, I highly urge you to read this book. Then you should read the God Delusion, because frankly you deserve it.Just a joke.

December is a month where on many stages children will be playing the role of the three wise men, in school plays. Many will also learn of this story Life of Pi by reading it or watching its premiere on film.There are three wise men in this tale. They are beacons of light and inspiration to the main protagonist of this story Piscine Molitor Patel aka Pi.This teenage boy has the insight of men much older than himself.Three religions appeal to him, he adopts three beliefs, rituals of worship congealed together to mold Pi into a very unique man. As the story progresses he couldn’t be more well equipped mentally for the test of his life that is fated for him.This test, a journey through disaster, starvation, time of isolation and contemplation, be it a rather extreme and tragic course of events his very faith, hope and endurance is put through a trial that would outdo any other event in a mans life span as thee most trying and monumental times of his life.The story leaves you with the feeling that Pi is one who contemplates not just humanity but nature and holds a conscious and sincere belief, he is not limited to a single sect or religion but a wider interfaith understanding in a creator and due to this prospers and is aided.Original and grand story this is, that holds you, it stirs you to question humanity, nature, fears, hope, belief and purpose on this earth swirl in your mind.If the ending of the vampire saga recently on the big screen, adapted from those books that you many have not read but loved the films, has not left you completely satisfied a feel what to read and watch next.If the premiere of film The Hobbit an adaptation of that great novel by Tolkien has not left thinking that was possibly the best film and story to read in 2012.If the news of a Royal pregnancy in the United Kingdom will not leave completely content through the cold winter.Then possibly the reading of Life of Pi during December and watching the story explode onto the big screen when it premiers soon near the end of the year, will leave you more enlightened and human, evoked, stirred and touched you more than all previously mentioned.I have a feeling its going to put the book and the author at the end of many tongues with words of praise and a great way to start a new year 2013. The film could do that much more for the book, just as many previous adaptations have done before for the writers, Stephen King, Stephanie Meyer, J K Rowling and Tolkien.
""It was a huge zoo, spread over numberless acres, big enough to require a train to explore it, though it seemed to get smaller as I grew older, train included. Now it's so small it fits in my head. You must imagine a hot and Humid place, bathed in sunshine and bright colours. The riot of flowers incessant. There are trees, shrubs and climbing plants in profusion-peepuls, gulmohurs, flames of the forest, red silk cottons, jacarandas, mangoes, jackfruits and many others that would remain unknown to you if they didn't have neat labels at their feet. There are benches. On these benches you see men sleeping, stretched out, or couples sitting, young couples, who steal glances at each other shyly and whose hands flutter in the air, happening to touch. Suddenly, amidst the tall and slim trees up ahead, you notice two giraffes quietly observing you. The sight is not the last of your surprises. The next moment you are startled by a furious outburst coming from a great troupe of monkeys, only outdone in volume by the shrill cries of strange birds. You come to a turnstile. You distractedly pay a small sum of money. You move on. You see a low wall. What can you expect beyond a low wall? Certainly not a shallow pit with two mighty Indian rhinoceros. But that is what you find. And when you turn your head you see the elephant that was there all along, so big you didn't notice it. And in the pond you realise those are hippopotamuses floating in the water. The more you look, the more you see. You are in Zootown!""""Alas, the sense of community that a common faith brings to a people spelled trouble for me. In time, my religious doings went from the notice of those to whom it didn't matter and only amused, to that of those to whom I did matter-and they were not amused.""What is your son doing going to temple?"" Asked the priest.""Your son was seen in church crossing himself,"" said the imam.""Your son gone Muslim,"" said the pandit.Yes, it was all forcefully brought to the attention of my bemused parents. You see, they didn't know. They didn't know that I was a practising Hindu, Christian and Muslim. Teenagers always hide a few things from their parents, isn't that so? All sixteen-year-olds have secrets, don't they? But fate decided that my parents and I and the three wise men, as I shall call them, should meet one day on the Goubert Salai seaside esplanade and that my secret should be outed. It was a lovely, breezy, hot Sunday afternoon and the Bay of Bengal glittered under a blue sky. Townspeople were out for a stroll. Children screamed and laughed. Coloured balloons floated in the air. Ice cream sales were brisk. Why think of business on such a day, I ask? Why couldn't they have just walked by with a nod and a smile ? It was not to be. We were to meet not just one wise man but all three, and not one after another but at the same time, and each would decide upon seeing us that right then was the golden occasion to meet that Pondicherry notable, the zoo director, he of the model devout son. When I saw the first, I smiled; by the time I had laid eyes on the third, my smile had frozen into a mask of horror. When it was clear that all three were converging on us, my heart jumped before sinking very low.""""I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, show no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unerring ease. It begins in your mind, always. One moment you are feeling calm, self-possessed, happy. Then fear, disguised in the grab of mild-mannered doubt, slips into your mind like a spy. Doubt meets disbelief and disbelief tries to push it out. But disbelief is a poorly armed foot solider. Doubt does away with it with little trouble. You become anxious. Reason comes to do battle for you. You are reassured. Reason is fully equipped with the latest weapons technology. But, to your amazement, despite superior tactics and a number of undeniable victories, reason is laid low. You feel yourself weakening, wavering. Your anxiety becomes dread. Fear next turns fully to your body, which is already aware that something terribly wrong is going on. Already your lungs have flown away like a bird and your guts have slithered away like a snake. Now your tongue drops dead like an opossum, while your jaw begins to gallop on the spot. Your ears go deaf. Your muscles begin to shiver as if they had malaria and your knees to shake as though they were dancing. Your heart strains to hard, while your sphincter relaxes too much. And so with the rest of your body. Every part of you, in the manner most suited to it, falls apart. Only your eyes work well. They always pay proper attention to fear.""

94,1627533417,05/02/2016,5.0,"The book, Life of Pi by Yann Martel, is immensely descriptive, uses eloquent diction, and provides various outlooks on religion while entertaining its audience. Set in India in the late 1970s, the Patel family lives under the power of Indira Gandhi, India’s prime minister. The main character’s father, Mr. Santosh Patel, was not a fan of Mrs. Gandhi. He believed she increasingly becoming closer to a dictator. Pi describes how his Father and Mother complained regularly about Mrs. Gandhi to him despite his lack of interest in politics. Indira Gandhi during her time as ruler was oppressive, imprisoned her opponents, and censored the press to assure nobody went against her. She wanted total control of India, which is what leads Pi’s family to board a boat in Canada, thus changing the course of Pi’s life immensely.The title, Life of Pi, is literal in its most basic definition: the life story of a boy named Pi. In the novel, the narrator, Piscine Patel, describes the many adventures he experienced through his young life. The story begins in India, where his family owns a zoo. He tells the audience what it is like living on a zoo, what the animals are like, and the different outlook it gave him on life. Along with the constant zoo-talk, Piscine, also known as Pi, talks about his close relationship with religion-- all religions, that is. Pi identifies himself as Muslim, Hindu, and Christian, much to the dismay of his barely religious Hindu parents. Then, the book takes a rather surprising turn. Pi’s parents decide to move to Canada, so they sell the zoo, cage their animals, and board a boat headed for North America. The boat sinks, leaving Pi trapped in a lifeboat with a tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena. The zebra and the hyena don’t make it- the zebra and orangutan are killed by the hyena and the hyena is killed by the tiger. For a while, it seems Pi is the only survivor of the shipwreck, but he does encounter one other lifeboat with the ship’s cook. However, he dies shortly after them meeting. Pi lives on the boat for almost a year, fishing, creating a raft, rationing his food, and taking care of his tiger, Richard Parker. Throughout the story, Martel creates vivid images in the reader’s mind. Especially in the very beginning of the story as Martel builds up the setting, he describes Pi’s family zoo in excellent detail: “I might stop by the terraria to look at some shiny frogs glazed bright, bright green, or yellow and deep blue, or brown and pale green” (Martel 14). He describes every animal in th zoo this way, allowing the reader to picture every hoof, tail, horn, or snout in the place. The reader will always be left amazed by Martel’s ability to build a movie in their mind.The author also employs complex, eloquent diction to show the intelligence level of the narrator, Pi. While describing the movements and behaviours of a three-toed sloth, Pi says, “It is a highly intriguing creature. Its only real habit is indolence” (Martel 3). He uses uncommon words such as “intriguing” and “indolence,” characterizing himself as intelligent. Although some people may not be able to relate with Pi’s ability to speak in an advanced manner, it does give the novel an air of sophistication you wouldn’t expect from a book about a teenager and a tiger on a boat. Even as he defines the common word, “house,” he uses complex diction: “A house is a compressed territory where our basic needs can be fulfilled close by and safely” (Martel 18). This book is beautifully written and flows smoothly. There are several outlooks on religion displayed within the novel that allow the reader to have a different view on other religions. Pi explains his opinion on religion: “Hindus...are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims...are bearded Hindus, and Christians...are hat-wearing Muslims” (Martel 50). Then, later in the book, he says, “Bapu Gandhi said, ‘All religions are true.’ I just want to love God.” He shows that he is extremely open-minded, hopefully allowing the reader to open their minds as well. This different outlook on religion, connecting and relating them all, embodies the spirituality of the entire novel. Martel emphasizes the importance of accepting and tolerating all people despite their beliefs, which is something plenty of people in the modern world need to learn.	Through the use of description and eloquent diction, Martel successfully shows his optimistic and loving view of the world. He shows open-minded views on religion and human nature, while entertaining his audience. Life of Pi is beautifully written and any reader should be able to take something out of it, whether it be happiness or a lesson on acceptance.",19,0.9988,0.023,0.828,0.15,0.48331452991453,POSITIVE,0.9415
95,319005520,04/25/2012,5.0,"I usually don’t have good luck reading books that just about everyone else had read. But Li of Pi—what a surprise. Published in 2001, and read by nearly everyone since, I came upon the book in a used bookstore. I loved the smell of used books, the feel of them--they're always better if they have signs of history: writings in the margins, wears and tears, here and there. This one was in good shape, meaning the reader before me had not left any discernible markings. I picked out the book because I needed something and wasn't quite sure where to look. All I could remember was someone telling me once upon a time that it was about a person alone in a boat with a tiger. Honestly, I thought that it was one of those clever post-modern books. Something I would try to write when I was 23 and considered myself an ""artist."" But no, the book is about a person on a boat stranded in the Pacific, and despite the absurdity, the person is caught with a tiger. And despite the odds, the book is all about the physicality and realism of the situation. The book is brutal, physical, detailed look at the will to survive. And yet because the protagonist is deep and spiritual, his journey to survive is also deep and spiritual. The author demonstrates the infiniteness of the natural world and the wonder of existence in the minute details of Pi Patel's tale of survival. In the effort to survive, every detail of the book takes on new significance. The form of the book also says quite a lot about the state of modern best sellers. I'm told from the outset that quite a lot of important newspapers and magazines liked the book. How on earth did the Economist come to review the book? That's my question. It’s a magazine about economics and politics for cripes sake. I couldn't imagine a better traveling book. I wasn't traveling when I read the book, but the book itself has motivated me to do more traveling. It also makes you treasure life, family, God, the food in front of you, and to behold the wonder of the natural world around you. Which parts did I like the best? Without giving too much away, the beginning—Yann Martel’s story of the origin of the book, the moments that they character has alone with the tiger of course, the excitement of the island, and the ambiguous ending. I’ll admit it. I’m not smart enough to know what the ending means. “And so it is with God” remains a cryptic line in my mind. I will leave it to you to explain it to me. I think that reading group guides at the end of books are hilarious—they are meant to appeal to those readers out there who are not cynical about group reading (never tried a book club—but will one day). And yet, despite my cynicism I am baffled by the simple complexity of the questions. Is Life of Pi a tragedy, romance, or comedy? It has aspects of all of them for sure—but it has a happy ending without ever having to be a romance or a comedy. A spiritual triumph-book! It cannot be called a comedy. Even the most absurd parts of the book happen in utmost seriousness. What laughs we receive only relieve us from the horror of the protagonist’s tale. Romance—between a boy and a tiger? Sort of. Pi really did love his tiger friend, didn’t he? And the protagonist appears like a jealous lover at the end (hopefully, that didn’t give away too much). Aw, life is nothing but hellos and goodbyes. So until next time, I say to you, whoever may read this: good journey. ",19,0.9978,0.05,0.78,0.17,0.514752971895829,POSITIVE,0.9975

101,6904565,09/27/2007,5.0,"This is a perfect example of low - and negative - expectations bringing in the mother load. A year or so ago this book suddenly hit the big time. Everywhere I looked people were reading it. They still are. Curious, I looked it up and was immediately put off. It sounded like one of those boring meditative, well-meaning quasi-religious books like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (the very first page of which, I assure you, bored me to tears - that was as far as I got).Yet a few months ago I found myself buying it at one of the secondhand bookshops I frequent, and I'm still not sure why. It got fat and lazy on my shelf, not making any effort whatsoever to catch my eye. I still expected it to be a lot of philosophical mumbling like Sophie's World, which I didn't get far with either back when I was a teenager. But then it came up as the book for June with one of the online book clubs I'm with, and when I eventually got around to it I found it very hard to put down.Piscine Molitor Patel grew up in Pondicherry, India. His father was a zookeeper and kept a great many animals at the Pondicherry Zoo - until a change in government has his family packing their bags for the Big Move to Winnipeg, Canada. All the animals have to be sold or traded off, and homes have been found for them in zoos in India and America, among other places. In 1977, those bound for the US join them on the Japanese cargo ship, the Tsimtsum, which, somewhere in the Pacific, sinks.The only survivors are Pi, a urangutan named Orange Juice, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger. The lifeboat they share is not just cramped, it's a case of who'll be dinner first. Pi not only has to survive the Pacific, he has to survive a hyena and a Bengal tiger.Written in the first person in a wonderful, humorous, frank style, we come to know Pi so well his story is infinitely believable. The question of whether his story is true or not is raised at the end, when an alternative version is given, but - as some people with a better grasp of such things helpfully pointed out in the book club - if you can believe Pi's story, you can believe in God. Here is one crux of the story: it is set up, at the beginning by ""the author"", who is supposedly re-telling a true story after having talked to Pi Patel at his home in Toronto, that ""this is a story that will make you believe in God"". It very well might, but that's not what I got out of this story.I didn't have a problem believing in it. Humans - and animals - are capable of the most extraordinary things in extraordinary times. The laws of nature have plenty of exceptions. With so many vivid details, so many helpful tips if you are ever stranded in the ocean on a lifeboat, and Pi's youthful (he's only 16) but wise narration, I not only wanted it to be real, but visited him on his boat completely while reading. I was drawn in so totally, I felt very few, and very brief, doubts at the end. Actually, the only bit I found even the slightest far-fetched was that a Japanese ship would sink in the first place. Granted, the crew were mostly Chinese, but I was very surprised that the ship wasn't maintained far and beyond regular standards.I have a great amount of love and respect for animals, and enjoyed learning about their behaviour in zoos vs nature (and Pi makes some good arguments in favour of zoos, though I'll never stop feeling guilty about them). There were some scenes that were downright horrific to me - I generally feel more anger, pain and sadness when confronted with cruelty to animals than to humans, perhaps because in such situations they are more vulnerable and dependant - or, in the wild, more out-matched and misunderstood. The section on anthropomorphism added to a fascination I've had with this for years now, and I loved the scene where Pi is talking to the Catholic priest - he is born Hindu but becomes a Christian and a Muslim, yes, all three - and talking to the Japanese men at the end; both got me giggling. This book is often funny, poignant, revealing and wise ... and the last sentence made me cry.I have no complaints about this book. I was not bored for a second. It was not heavy-handed, lecturing, narrow-minded, self-indulgent or anything else that annoys me in books. I wondered how you could write a book about a boy stuck on a lifeboat in the Pacific for, what was it? 227 days? and not bore your readers to tears - but Martel managed it effortlessly. I finished it yesterday morning over breakfast and already I have an itch to pick it up and read it again. But first I think I'll invest in the beautiful hardcover illustrated edition that came out a few months ago - I flipped through it before I read it (ah, this reminds me of why I must have bought the book) and loved the paintings in it. My favourite is of the three different holy men looming over the viewer (Pi), after realising for the first time that he has been going to all three different temples of worship.Without wanting to give it away, I just have to say: when you get to the beginning of Part Two, you'll be completely won over I think, if you weren't already. I honestly didn't see it coming AT ALL - call me blind and stupid but I was floored, in the best possible way. I laughed out loud when I realised. This book is full of surprises (there's another towards the end which I won't even hint at) and, corny as this sounds, the prose sweeps you up and carries you towards a far shore just like the Pacific swept up Pi and took him to Mexico. Well worth a Man Booker Prize. And yeah, it did bring me closer to believing in God than anything else ever has, sure, but it brought me treasure greater than that :)",18,0.9984,0.077,0.765,0.157,0.5667974923399453,NEGATIVE,0.9359
102,1275207216,05/08/2015,4.0,"Buddy-read with the wonderful Rabbit! (Date to be determined) 4 StarsI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, I am a hunter’s daughter. I grew up in a home where carcases hanging to dry out in the garage was not at all uncommon. My earliest clear memory is of sitting on my father’s knees, wearing his faded camouflage cap – done up to the last button to even have a semblance of staying on my child-sized head – plucking feathers from ducks he had hunted that morning. I have felt the squish of scraping a salmon’s liver out of its spine with the back of my thumb nail.  (This picture is me at age 19 GRINNING while gutting a 30 pound spring salmon.)To say that my childhood was drenched in blood and viscera is an understatement and a half. My childhood couldn’t possibly have been any different than Pi’s. In my household ‘vegetarian’ was practically a swear word.  So when I say that Life of Pi gets gritty in a way that makes my stomach squick at times, this is the history and lifetime I am gauging it on. However, that survivalist grit is entirely compelling. I adored the fishing scenes. And while I do have this one pesky question about raw fowl that stuck in my brain and will not come out, I found the entire of those scenes very realist and fascinating. Life of Pi was surrealism at its finest. But it’s written in such a gritty and real way that it becomes almost believable. The character of Richard Parker was amazingly created, and I thoroughly enjoyed that his baseness was not minimized. A tiger isn’t going to become a kitten of ginormous proportions just because he is trapped aboard a life raft, that isn’t a reality my brain will accept. However, the ways he is trained by Pi seemed outlandish but believable, in a fantastic way.

112,163160615,04/24/2011,5.0,"In a nutshell, “Life of Pi” is one long metaphor about man, his faith and his God, adversities, resiliency, and above all, hope. If I were to describe the book, I would say it is engaging, heartwarming, and hilarious. (Yes, you read it correctly.) The only downside is that it tended to drag a little, but I didn't mind; after all, what can you expect from a novel, written in the first-person point of view, about a teenage boy who is shipwrecked in the Pacific with only a 450-pound adult Bengal tiger left for company? That, in a sentence, is what the novel is all about. I constantly put myself in the shoes of Piscine Molitor Patel - “Pi” for short, as in 3.1416 – while he was stranded in a lifeboat with Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger in whose claws he was sure he was to meet his end. I knew, without doubt, that I could never have done what he did, and survive for more than 200 days floating in the ocean, practically starving to death, and with a carnivorous mammal for company, to boot. But Pi was an extraordinary person: he was resilient, he never lost hope (even when the circumstances actually justified it), he did his best to co-exist in extremely cramped living quarters with a carnivore, and best of all, he never doubted God and fervently kept the faith throughout his ordeal. It's an amazing life story, indeed. And although there were several situations in the story which even an unskeptical person may find improbable (e.g. The carnivorous island in the latter part of the story), it nonetheless helped drive home the point: that there is always hope. I've read Yann Martel's “Beatrice and Virgil” prior to reading “Pi”, and I remember liking the former very much. I also know that “Pi” is a highly-acclaimed novel, and that it comes recommended by peers. After reading it, I now fully understand that, indeed, “Pi” is worth all the accolades and good reviews that have been thrown its way. I will always remember “Life of Pi” as the book that made my heart so full, and rekindled my faith that, even in the face of adversity, God will always pull you through. EDIT: I was reading some of my GR friends' reviews of the book after having published mine, and came across TINTIN's review. Please read it, it is one of the most in-depth and intelligent reviews of the book that I've read. :)",16,0.9976,0.037,0.754,0.209,0.4813454861111111,POSITIVE,0.9993
113,393752870,08/17/2012,2.0,"Piscine Patel is reminiscing about his childhood. His father owned and ran a zoo in Pondicherry in India, and he was a happy, inquisitive and comfortable child. After suffering ridicule at his name, often pronounced ‘pissing’ he decides to call himself Pi, after the irrational number. His recollection include thoughts on names and religion. Even though he is a Hindu, he investigates Christianity and Islam, deciding to covert to all of them, seeing that each has beneficial elements.Changes in circumstances mean that Pi’s father sells the zoo, and decides to emigrate to Canada with the family and the animals from the zoo. The Tsimtsum, the cargo ship carrying them there sinks during a storm, and Pi somehow manages to escape into a liferaft. But he has company, a injured zebra, a spotted hyena and an orangutan have also managed to find there way to it. The hyena manages to kill both of the other animals, and Pi fears for his life. As the hyena moves in for the kill, he then discovers the final inhabitant, the massive Royal Bengal tiger, Richard Parker is also aboard. He constructs a temporary raft from life jackets and tethers it to the boat so he can be away from the tiger. Remembering the training he learnt he starts to condition the tiger to accept him as the alpha male, and moves back onto the lifeboat, feeding him and the tiger fish and turtle. There are accounts of various tales as they drift across the ocean, real and imagined as he drifts in and out of delirium, before he washes up on a Mexican shore.As he recovers in hospital, he is visited by two men from the Japanese Ministry of Transport. He tells them the first tale of his survival, which they don’t believe, so he tells them an allegory of it, and asks them to choose their preferred story.It is an interesting book in some ways. Partly commentary on religion, partly adventure and survival mixed with some magical realism, it doesn’t really fit any genre. The first part of the book dragged quite a lot for me, but the second part was much better with his clinging onto life with the tiger in the lifeboat, and made for quite a good story. The final part was quite amusing too, with the conversations between Pi and the officials bordering on farce at times. Overall I quite enjoyed it, but I am not a huge fan of magical realism and this sailed very close to the wind with this. 2.5 stars overall.",16,0.8602,0.055,0.865,0.079,0.4864247311827956,POSITIVE,0.869
114,29172798,08/03/2008,1.0,"I struggle with fables and parables. With few exceptions, I find them invariably clumsy. They try too hard. If they hold the line on subtlety, they end up being obscure to the point of unintelligible. And if they maintain coherence and remain comprehensible, then they suffer from being so heavy-handed as to be trite or clichéd; or so direct as to be laughably simplistic.Fables can't win for losing in my book.Pi's GR description calls it ""fablelike."" So, what -- it falls short of being a full-fledged fable? It fails at fabling? What does it succeed at then? 'Coz if you remove the symbolism that Martel uses to make it into a parable (and that's what I'm going to settle on--it seems to have a definite religious lesson to teach us), it doesn't succeed at being much of a story.Symbolism, metaphor, simile ... yes, these are good. These are the herbs and spices essential to concoct a delicious story. A good metaphor--even a sustained one--is used judiciously by a writer to add flavour, but never overwhelms the dish. An apt simile is like the garnish on the side of the plate--an aesthetically pleasing finishing touch. (If you're Tom Robbins, you can get away with making similes your appetizers, veg and dessert courses, but no one else can.)Let these guys take over, and you've got a fable on your hands. Or maybe a parable. And that's even more unwieldy than having a tiger in your lifeboat.If this one hadn't been so hyped, winning the Man Booker and all, I might have liked it marginally better.

117,114821188,08/02/2010,4.0,"Every once in a while, I find a story larger than the pages that contain it. Life of Pi is one such novel.The cover features a boat and a broad expanse of calm ocean underneath great big puffy clouds, beckoning my imagination. The blurb says: ""Life of Pi is a real adventure..."" The cover's promise didn't let me down. It was one wild larger-than-life adventure. The first stop was India. But before the main story is the Preface by way of the Author's Note which I usually skip but for some reason I decided to read through this time. Good thing I did because the preface turned out to be part of the story and and introduced me to the book's premise: ""I have a story that will make you believe in God.""Now that's a tall order, as the author himself mentions in the same passage. My curiosity was piqued.The introduction switches back and forth between present day Canada and the 70s, during the childhood of the hero Pi Patel in his native India. The present-day chapters are short and give glimpses of his character. The first third of the book focuses on Pi's childhood from how he got his name, how he spent his time in the zoo that belonged to his family, and how he became a practicioner of multiple faiths. Martel was so convincing that he led me to believe that Pi is a real person. If it weren't for Wikipedia, I would have gone on believing that the novel was a true-to-life story.I enjoyed Part One immensely where Pi Patel talks about growing up in a zoo, mentioning surprising and detailed analyses of animal psychology and behavior that perfectly set up the latter half of the book. I found them as enjoyable and humorous as a lecture on animal behavior by a lively and interesting professor. Later he tells of how he, a born Hindu, converted to Christianity and later to Islam. He practiced all 3 faiths simulataneously, to the chagrin of religious leaders. I enjoyed reading his (humorous but true) Hindu perspective of the Christian and Muslim faiths. His integration of the 3 faiths without conflict mirrors that of my own beliefs, which made me empathize with him.But the real meat of the book begins when Pi is shipwrecked in the middle of the Pacific en route to Canada. Not only did Pi find himself in a lifeboat with a full-grown Bengal tiger, his circumstances became dimmer and dimmer and his ordeals more and more incredible as to stretch believability. However, unbelievable developments were marked by the gritty realities of life as a castaway and I found myself walking the thin line between belief and disbelief. I thought this was a glaring oversight on the author's part until I read the very last chapter and the tables turned.***Warning: SPOILERS AHEAD***The last part, while Pi is recuperating on land and being interviewed by a couple of bungling Japanese engineers (they are more like a comedy duo than real men of science) is the clincher.Suddenly you see the entire story of Pi's survival in a new light. Is the hyena the cook, the zebra the young captain, the orangutan his mother, and Richard Parker (the tiger) Pi himself? Or is Richard Parker God? If the characters in the story become human, therefore humanizing their suffering and necessitating acceptance of human decapitation, cannibalism, murder and other unpleasant things as reality, is it not better to accept the more incredible story of the animals as truth? Do you not want to believe Pi's brave and noble adventure as real?What is Yann Martel trying to point say here? That religion and belief in God are necessary because the alternative is a bleak and grim reality? And because of this reason, the stories in all religions, though stranger than fiction, are accepted as truth? Did man created God out of necessity? That we want to believe in God because it is the better story, the better alternative? You may agree or you may not, or you may have reached a different conclusion from mine, but the story of Pi is one you think about and continues in your mind long after the final page. ***SPOILER END***Life of Pi can be read as a straightforward story of a castaway's wild adventure in the Pacific, but to read it as such misses the entire point of the book. It is at heart a philosophical and multi-layered novel. Martel fills it with philosophical musings about life, beauty, pain, suffering, faith, and the convergence of science and religion. The musings are at times wondrous and insightful, at times poignant.The book has a few flaws though, especially at the end. At times the philosophical turns in the conversation sounded unnatural, like stuffing a moral lesson down the reader's throat. The Japanese engineers are so unbelievably incompetent as to seem like cartoon characters (no Japanese professional I know talk and act like that, unless they were gangsters). Though maybe that was the point Martel was trying to make, that they were unprofessional. And also, verifying the veracity of Pi's account would have been easy with 1970s technology. A tiger would at least have left a mark on the lifeboat if it had been living there for so long.The writing style has a slightly archaic feel to it that may not appeal to some readers, though I didn't find it to be a problem.I am glad to have read this book. It's different from any book I've read so far. P.S. I looked at some other reviews after I wrote this and saw a lot of points I missed that others picked up. I realize now that though the three parts of the book seemed disjointed, they actually wrap up very well. I love Eva's review here at Goodreads (from Nov. 17 2007) which sums up Life of Pi nicely: There is no use in trying to provide a brief synopsis because once you finish the book you might decide that this was not, indeed, what the book was about at all. There is no use because, depending on your philosophical bent, the book will mean something very different to your best friend than it will to you.",15,0.9989,0.061,0.781,0.158,0.4657483930211203,POSITIVE,0.9565
118,360367417,07/03/2012,5.0,"5 StarsI adored every word of this fantastical piece of fiction, of this colorfully imaginative fable, of this take on god, religion, and zoo keeping. Life of Pi has been in my reading queue for a very long time, and my wife has tried to get me to read it many times over the years. What was I waiting for??? Yann Martel sees things through goggles that appear to be very similar to my own. I do not want to give away any spoilers as the details of this fable make it a magical ride that should not be missed. In a nutshell this is one man’s way to make us believe, by sharing with us a story to inspire, he wants to make us to believe in god, a god, maybe even any god. It is a story about survival, a tale of unbelievable circumstances, yet at its heart is a story about a man, god, and love. The writing in this novel is sublime. I read many passages multiple times as it is a masterpiece. The twists and turns will have your jaw hit the floor and at times and make you say “No Way!” It is symbolism at its best.“I can well imagine an atheist’s last words: “White, white! L-L-Love! My God!”—and the deathbed leap of faith. Whereas the agnostic, if he stays true to his reasonable self, if he stays beholden to dry, yeastless factuality, might try to explain the warm light bathing him by saying, “Possibly a f-f-failing oxygenation of the b-b-brain,” and, to the very end, lack imagination and miss the better story.”“I was alone and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging on to an oar, an adult tiger in front of me, sharks beneath me, a storm raging about me. Had I considered my prospects in the light of reason, I surely would have given up and let go of the oar, hoping that I might drown before being eaten. But I don’t recall that I had a single thought during those first minutes of relative safety. I didn’t even notice daybreak. I held on to the oar, I just held on, God only knows why.”The chapter where Pi talks to all three of his holy men and defends his point of view is remarkable. It is the antithesis of prejudice, bigotry and strong bias. I loved the ending and Pi’s conversation with the inspectors as its puts the whole novel into perspective. He sums up most people’s predispositions and bias by stating:““I know what you want. You want a story that won’t surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won’t make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.”“Uhh …”“You want a story without animals.”“Yes!”“Without tigers or orangutans.”“That’s right.”“Without hyenas or zebras.”“Without them.”“Without meerkats or mongooses.”“We don’t want them.”“Without giraffes or hippopotamuses.”“We will plug our ears with our fingers!”“So I’m right. You want a story without animals.”“We want a story without animals that will explain the sinking of the Tsimtsum.”“Give me a minute, please.”I loved this book and will definitely reread this one another day. This is a novel worthy of classroom study. The only other novel that comes to mind in similarity and scope is the amazing piece of fiction: “The Alchemist” by Paul Coelho. I cannot recommend this book enough.",15,0.997,0.053,0.785,0.162,0.5369587301587301,POSITIVE,0.9999

I knew if I didn't, people would ask me why I hated it, and I wouldn't have as clear an answer as if I finished it5.

I think the tiger and the other animals maybe symbolize something.What I learned from it is that sometimes we really need to believe in the unbelievable and believe in something, whatever religion it is.

122,1765662780,09/29/2016,3.0,"The spiritual power of storiesI first saw the movie, and that's never a good idea, because that took the suspense away and it also made the intrinsic moralistic message too clear; so I inevitably read the book in a different, more critical way. Perhaps therefore my review is a bit too harsh, I apologize.First something about the structure of the book. As a reader you have to wait a long while before the real story starts: the build up to the actual story is over 100 pages long, and contains detailed explanations about the behavior of animals and the three religions which inspired Pi in his teens. There's some interesting stuff, but it's somewhat of a threshold to get over. The subsequent Richard Parker story (the boy with the tiger in the boat) kept its tension, but I remarked I was annoyed by the long descriptive passages. Maybe I'm doing little justice to the complexity of this story, because all in all it is a clever game of metaphors that Martel offers in this part of the book. And finally the whole story debouches into the dialogue Pi, after his rescue, has with some Japanese officials that investigate the ships wreck; there the moralistic message was a bit too obvious for my taste. There ends my severe judgment. The big question is of course: what did Martel with this unlikely story (boy spends 227 days on the ocean in a lifeboat, along with a Bengal tiger) actually wanted to tell us, and is he also convincing? Warning: spoilers ahead!Actually, the author gives a lot away in his prologue: “That's what fiction is about, isn't it, the selective transforming of reality? The twisting of it to bring out its essence?""(p. x). In other words: Life of Pi is one long plea for approaching reality through stories; stories look beyond the dry facts (Martel calls it the “dry, yeastless factuality”), beyond the scientific-rational approach, and beyond what we call in our Western tradition, THE truth. That truth is poor because it only says something about the outer side of reality; only stories add a dimension to it and give reality colour; even more: they make life possible. Big words, I know. But let's go into the story and watch Pi: there is little doubt that he has had a very traumatic experience, especially if we assume that the second short story Pi tells to the skeptical Japanese officials perhaps is the “true” representation of what happened, the truth in the classic sense. Can anyone after such horrific events pick up the thread of life? Not at all, right? Yet Pi has done this: the author ensures to depict in detail the later life of Pi in Canada, with his wife and children, his qualifications and work, with his richly decorated house; this is a man that really has taken up life again. How could he do that? Indeed, through the Richard Parker story, in which he gave sense to the devastating experience that happened to him; only so he could cope with it and go on living.So, Life of Pi is to be read primarily as a passionate plea for the power of stories. I suspect that many people will recognize and follow this reasoning and in that sense Martel's argument certainly is convincing and successful. But there's more. Martel explicitly relates this narrative plea to religion. And there we are in a much more slippery domain. The whole book through there are references to God, to what various religions tell, and to the importance that religion has in Pi’s survival. I notice in a lot of reviews that many people dropp out at this point. In my opinion they do so wrongly, because religions are narrative structures that really tell a lot of valuable things about reality, things that remain hidden in a superficial reading of that reality. But I acknowledge there are some issues involved here that are quite problematic. First of all, there are many religious narratives possible, and Martel gives the impression that they are all valuable and thus equal (the story isn't totally clear on this), and that is at least a very relativistic point of view. Two: religions are so much more than narrative structures, they also make statements that can be very reductionist (very one-sided interpretations of reality) and thus very easy can be misunderstood or deliberately manipulated, especially if they are associated with institutionalization and the exercise of power. That aspect of religion Martel ignores in this book; given the limited scope of a novel that is quite understandable, but it is an aspect that the reader should definitely take into account.In short: Life of Pi certainly is a valuable book, it is a captivating story and it shows the strength of narratives in personal life, but the link with the delicate domain of religion is not really brought to a good end.",14,0.965,0.082,0.813,0.105,0.5034946236559139,NEGATIVE,0.9994
123,393029189,08/16/2012,3.0,"Life of Pi will make you think.Initially, I was unimpressed. The book jacket promised a survival story about a boy on a boat who has to contend with not only the elements, but a ferocious tiger too. However, the book began with copious reflections on religion and random musings about animals. I understand that the author probably wanted to set up the story and provide some initial food for thought, but the only thing I appreciated out of the first 100 pages was the idea that people can believe in more than one thing (whether it be religion, or just conflicting ideas in general) and still be a good person. Pi practices multiple religions, but he has good intentions and a pure heart.I liked the second part of the book. I did not love it, but I liked it. The middle 200 pages or so delineated Pi's harrowing struggle to survive in a vast ocean with almost nothing to aid him, and a frightening beast beside him. Martel's description of the plot and the imagery he employs entertained me, though I did not empathize with Pi to any great extent. I felt like I was reading a decent, unsurprising story.Then, the ending struck. This book has one one of those endings that makes me mutter scream out loud ""what is my life? Who am I? My entire life is a lie!"" I promise you, if you read this book from start to finish, you will want need someone to talk it through with by the end, because your mind will explode. Or combust. Like I always say, I love books that make me feel, and books that make me think. Life of Pi falls into the latter category. Though if I reveal what it made think about, I will spoil the book for those who haven't read it yet... thank goodness for spoiler tags!(view spoiler)[Okay. Don't get me wrong, I loved how Yann Martel left the book open to readers' interpretation. It will make a lot of people think about what they believe in. Yet, after reflecting on the book, I came to the conclusion that I was not as enamored with the ending as I had thought. Throughout the entire story, Martel forced religion onto his readers. He did not make this subtle at all - it was blatant as could be. While I have no problem with religion, I don't like how the ending forced readers to think ""either I'm a cold-blooded atheist or indecisive agnostic who doesn't believe in magical endings at all"" or ""I'm a religious person who can see all of the magic and goodness in life because of my connection with God.""Personally, I am not religious. But just because I am not religious does not mean that I only believe in science and numbers and facts. I do think there is something more out there, though I'm not exactly sure what. It's not a question that plagues me and causes me problems, as Martel suggests about agnosticism. It's simply who I am. It almost strikes me as hypocritical that Martel would make the acceptance of others' beliefs such a salient point in the book only to turn around and pull out the Christianity card at the last minute. (hide spoiler)]Overall, despite the feelings of frustration I expressed in the spoiler section, I would recommend Life of Pi to nearly anyone.

Making an effort to deliver it as calmly and logically as possible, but good intentions are the same as they have ever been.I went into this book with expectations that I would probably really like it. I'm distrustful of extremely popular books that have been lauded beyond belief in popular culture, but this one had been praised by many that I knew and/or admired. Thus my expectations. Unfortunately, these expectations have not be filled. I'm a fan of the author's writing style, especially when it concerned descriptions and discussions of animals. However.I am an agnostic atheist. As soon as the religious passages began to crop up, I knew that I would feel a large amount of bias against whatever the author had to say. I always make an effort in separating what I personally feel from how I view the writing as a work of art, because there are few things worse than restricting one's admiration of something because of inherent prejudice. I must say this though. Were the author truly reporting the story of a separate individual, I would be forgiving of one particular passage that he wrote, beginning with the sentence: 'It is not atheists who get stuck in my craw, but agnostics.' This piece however is a work of fiction, and as such I was very annoyed with this statement.It is all very well to claim brotherhood with Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, three very dissimilar points of the religious spectrum. It is fine to say that even atheism has its merits, expressing a slight disapproval yet not going so far as to whole-heartedly condemn it. But if you're going to first claim agnosticism is a religion (newsflash: it isn't) and then backtrack full speed from your painting of harmony between all types of belief, well. That's just not good manners. The author goes on to say, ""To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation."" There is a very big difference between doubt and being aware of the limits of one's knowledge regarding matters of universal truths, be they theological or otherwise. I could also argue that the immobility actually results from belief in a religion, but I won't.To use the author's words, that was the only part that really stuck in my craw,, and the rest of the book failed to exceed expectations enough to make up for this indigestible mound. Regarding the rest: Pi's adventure was nothing short of remarkable, and I learned many interesting details regarding animals and their relationships with other species, human and otherwise. The ending was a bit jarring, as well as a little too parable-esque for my tastes. I'm going to blame that part on the bias, but there's only so much passively neutral hem-hawing that I can manage.

However, as it turns out, the ruminations on religion (and atheism and agnosticism) were not nearly as soapboxy as I feared, and they come from the protagonist, who is a 16-year-old boy.Actually, Pi Patel's attitude towards religion is neatly summed up in his anecdote about his spiritual awakening in his hometown of Pondicherry, India. Inspired to ""love God,"" he begins attending church, mosque, and temple, becoming a devout Christian, Muslim, and Hindu - all at once. Much to the distress of his priest, imam, and sadhu when his triple-dipping religious observances are discovered. This is evidently supposed to reveal something deep and universal about Pi's spirituality, but to me it revealed that he's a kid with an understandable yearning and curiosity about the divine, and no intellectual foundation or empirical experience with which to genuinely seek truth.But that's all in the first few chapters. Most of the book is about his months-long survival on a lifeboat in the Pacific with a grown Bengal tiger as his sole fellow survivor.How does a sixteen-year-old Indian boy survive months on a lifeboat with 450 pounds of hungry Bengal tiger and not get eaten? The tale is a fantastic one, and it's very well told, sprinkled with a great deal of information about zoology and animal behavior. I can't personally attest that Yann Martel did his research, though I haven't read any reviews by zoologists saying he doesn't know what he's talking about. But I found myself believing.Which is ironic, because in the climax, the investigators to whom Pi tells his tale, after he finally makes landfall in Mexico, do not believe him. So Pi tells them a different tale. The reader is meant to decide for himself, I suppose, which is the real one.I probably shouldn't compare this book to a Salman Rushdie novel, because while the main character is Indian, the author is not, so it should be a coincidence that Life of Pi reminded me a lot of Midnight's Children - the style, not the story. I haven't read enough of either Rushdie or Martel to know whether they really do have a similar style. But the fact is, those two Man-Booker Prize winners both narrated by young Indian protagonists do strike me as similar. Martel also writes about sometimes horrific events with a wry humor sprinkled throughout.So yes, this was a good book and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I'm still knocking off a star for the agnostic-bashing.",14,0.9929,0.05,0.82,0.13,0.4871794871794873,NEGATIVE,0.6971
126,120439124,09/06/2010,5.0,"I enjoyed the originality and he imaginative power of this book immensely, and I still think this is a great adventure story. I have to say, though, that I did not find the twist at the end a stroke of genius or some incredibly thought-provoking moment, the way other readers did. I thought it sounded more like the author had been thinking far too much about how to end his story, and after all that thinking he came up with a philosophical twist that is both simplistic and pessimistic. Simplistic because it assumes that all religion is about is ""just a different way to tell the same story"". True in part, but a ridiculously shallow perspective: saying that billions of people have a certain Faith, whatever it is, only so that they can tell themselves fairy tales in order to better survive life is definitely missing the point (and also it is underestimating people!). It's missing the fundamental realization that multiple levels of truth can cohexist in our lives. It's missing completely the depth and richness of what communicating with God is about.Pessimistic because, from an emotional point of view, the author ends up spoiling the story he just told us, by telling us ""by the way, everything I just told you is actually s**t"". This is how that ending felt to me. I couldnt care less about the author's philosophical thinking on faith, shallow or not. That had nothing to do with the book. The main problem is that the emotional momentum, and the soul of this book, so masterfully constructed until the last chapter, get shredded in pieces by that last artificial comment. You just don't do that, it's not respectful to the story itself, and to the readers, who at the end of the day gave you their trust from the beginning. Or perhaps the author thought long and hard about how to give his book a special ""higher place"" in the editorial world, and thought it would make it cooler if it had some grand philosophical statement at the end. Again, I see his point, as it is obvious and simplistic, but I cared about THE story, I didnt care about some wishy-washy idea on how we should interpret religion and God.",14,0.9841,0.068,0.788,0.144,0.4583603896103896,NEGATIVE,0.9989

130,175643041,06/11/2011,4.0,"I started this on a plane to Indonesia. Let me tell you that reading about a boy marooned in the Pacific with a tiger while flying 39,000 ft. over said ocean left me fearing the wrath of God in and out of the novel. There are so many things written about this novel's meaning and literary attributes. I’m not a scholar of religion, nor particularly religious. I speak from personal experience in living in a household that associates with two different faiths. The friction of this divide within my family has made me sensitive to religious conflict and has led me to question religion (as an institution) and spirituality. It is with this background that I read and write about Life of Pi.I didn't think this was a perfect novel. It had its share of strengths and weaknesses, and compared to other books on religious and spiritual self-discovery, Life of Pi lacked the depth and gravitas that evoke a true reflection of god and self. However, in spite (or perhaps because) of its ""lightness"", I enjoyed Life of Pi as both a story and a moment of self-reflection.What appealed to me about this novel was its incredibly personal portrayal of how, for one young boy, religion has broken free of man-made creeds and became something utterly spiritual and whole. In my view, two pivotal actions led Pi to arrive at this spiritual conclusion:The first was his devout belief and practice of multiple religions. This seemed trite at first – an literary cop out to illustrate the concept that God is ultimately one being, regardless of religion. That Pi embraced the three most prominent religions (with focus on Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism – though notably not Buddhism) also made the act seemed contrived. However, it was a conscious decision, the mental and emotional first step that Pi took that made the rest of the book so compelling.The second was nature (as a work of God) challenging Pi’s chosen path, (particularly after he withstood the criticism of his father and brother), initiated by the shipwreck that began Pi's harrowing journey of survival. The book plays with the notion that when man is at the end of his mettle is he equipped to break free of the confines of the material world and truly seek God. Suffering and hardship as a means of testing faith is not an original concept, but the wry humor and the practical threat of a Bengal tiger illustrating the constant battle between the spiritual and practical, humanity against nature, and generosity's incompatibility with survival was interesting to read.Overall, while not groundbreaking or gut wrenching, Yann Martel posed an interesting, unique view of man's relationship with God and nature. 4 solid stars for the story of the boy and the tiger, and recommended for those with open minds and spiritual quandaries. Note: As if I weren't enough of a glutton for punishment, I watched the film adaptation on a plane, again flying over the Pacific. Despite the lingering fear of falling into the ocean, I was stunned by the beautiful, evocative cinematography. The actor who played teenaged Pi was also charming, and personalized the movie for more casual audience. I highly recommend it as an alternative if you cannot get through the book.",13,0.9876,0.058,0.81,0.131,0.4826851851851852,NEGATIVE,0.5527
131,1630585932,05/06/2016,4.0,"Yann Martel wrote Life of Pi to reveal his ideas on faith and inner strength. He does this through the character of Piscine Patel, also referred to as Pi – who exhibits qualities such as, immense faith, inner strength, determination, and the will to live, which help him survive his 227-day voyage through the Pacific Ocean.Life of Pi is a fiction novel, but Martel tells Pi’s story with a very realistic sense. In the Author’s Note, Martel explains how he spoke with Pi and met with him in order to learn about his story as if this was an actual event that had occurred. Throughout Part One of the novel, Martel talks as if this story is true – he even directly states in the Author’s Note that the story is true. Martel begins Life of Pi with a flashback to Pi’s childhood; he uses this to explain his family’s situation, why they were moving to Canada, and Pi’s unique views on life. Within Part One, Pi describes in detail the zoo his father owned and the lesson his father taught him about animals – “every animal [is] dangerous if you [aren’t] careful.” Other than describing the zoo, Pi also describes how he came to know three different religions and how he feels about it all, how being involved in these religions effect the way he looks at life. By the end of Part One, we have a deep knowledge and understanding of Pi.During Part Two, Richard Parker is introduced, we don’t have much knowledge of him except that Pi “has grown to fear him and yet love him”. Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger that is trapped on the lifeboat with Pi, and because of the way Pi felt about Richard Parker, he develops as the novel progresses. By the time Part Three roles around, we have a better understanding of Richard Parker, we think, until Martel throws a whole new idea out – what if Richard Parker was solely a metaphor for Pi himself? This might actually be true considering Pi’s mood often reflected in the tiger’s. Through this, we can see great attributes in each of them, Pi adapts easily and quickly in is current situation and also displays faith, hope, and perseverance.Life of Pi is initially set in Pondicherry, India – Pi’s hometown, while the end of the novel is set in Canada; each place represents a safe haven, which contrasts to most of the novel. The majority of the novel was set on the ocean, in which Pi must learn to survive despite the storms, lack of supplies, and a tiger that essentially threatens his life. The harsh setting of the ocean sets Pi up with trouble from the beginning to the end of his voyage, but with faith and strength, Pi shines through even the toughest of times. Life of Pi serves a great lesson – to have faith in the toughest of times. You may not be a religious person, but I recommend Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, he does an exceptional job of carrying the theme through to the reader. Chapter after chapter, Pi finds himself with new problems, but it’s the way he deals with these problems that’s extraordinary.",13,0.9954,0.056,0.793,0.152,0.5211916461916462,POSITIVE,0.9988

I’m a very firm believer that there people are wrong. Books are gifts from the gods that never deserve to be marked upon–a for sure mark of abuse, no matter the intentions– or written in, or pages to be dog-eared. However, this book throws all my beliefs into the garbage disposal and completely changes my mind. If I hadn’t checked this book out from the local library, and it was mine to own, I would be holding Life of Pi: Rainbow Extraordinaire; complete with dog ears to mark my favorite, newly highlighted passages on my newly read pages. 	Pi is a stubborn, strong hearted boy from Pondicherry India. The way he describes his childhood, as the book is from his perspective, and the things he does, places he goes, or people he meets is an incredible sight to see. He allows us all, no matter the age, to live vicariously through a boy who sees the world with such bright and adventurous eyes. Pi is the type of guy takes you out on a dinner date and you end up two states away because he wants to go on an adventure. Pi never lets a page go by without giving the reader some type of philosophical message to think about. 	The Life of Pi taught me more about religion in its 356 pages than my 18 years of life. Pi starts out as Hindu and then adds Christianity and Islam to his mix. He broadens his minds and allows every God to help him on his 277 day journey with Richard Parker, the bengal tiger. To define is to limit, and as Pi spends each day with Richard Parker, allowing their spirits to grow and diminish and grow again, together, he is not defining their relationship but granting it access to prosper–although that doesn’t mean Richard Parker wouldn’t look at him in a crowded, or deserted, room.	Nick Carroway of The Great Gatsby thinks Jay Gatsby is the most hopeful person he has ever met; however, Nick never met Pi. Pi keeps his faith, survival guide, whistle, and hope close to his heart throughout the entire journey. His boat may be beating back against the current, but Pi wouldn’t dare to be borne back ceaselessly into the past. His hope never strayed far and he knew he would eventually be saved. His hunger for life constantly astounds the reader.	The Life of Pi makes me want to grab life by the tiger stripes and never let a moment go unnoticed.

Later, much later, there were many, many times I could have bought it but I prioritized other books so I didn't get it even then. One time, during a book club meet-up, some friends were talking about this book so I asked them if they think it was something I would like. I remember someone telling me that I might be bored with it, so I decided to just borrow instead of buy. But alas, I never got to borrow it even after. It still wasn't in my priority list, up until late last year, when my friends were talking about the books that will soon become movies. I figured, since I was starting to explore outside of the genres I usually read, that maybe it's finally time to read it.That, and there was the tiger.I love tigers. Tigers are some of my favorite animals. If I could own a tiger for a pet, I would do that in a heartbeat. Tiger photos are an automatic reblog in my Tumblr, and I swear, I could stare at them for hours on end. So a big part of my wanting to read and watch 
Life of Pi
was because of the tiger in the story.Piscine Molitor Patel -- Pi, for short -- is a teenage boy whose family owned a zoo in Pondicherry, India. Pi has lived an interesting life, one that made the author seek him out so he can write his book, intrigued by the idea that Pi's story can make him believe in God. 
Life of Pi
is really, well, Pi's life, as he grew up surrounded by animals, his quest for (three) religions, growing with his belief and of course, his 227-days in the middle of the ocean after the ship carrying them to Canada sunk, leaving him on a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, which probably helped me appreciate it. I just knew about the shipwreck and the tiger, but I didn't know what was supposed to happen around it. I liked Pi's voice, his boyishness that was slightly tinged with pain of recollection, since the story was being told from the point of view of the older Pi. I liked the lush atmosphere of Pi's life in the zoo, and all the animal behavior lessons that he shared. It reminded me a bit of all the animal lessons in Animorphs by K.A. Applegate, my favorite scifi series growing up. This made me want to go visit a zoo and observe the animals for myself.I also really liked Pi's journey into religion. Or religions, rather. I think this is a part that people either really get or don't get in the book. I don't claim to get it all completely, but I appreciated Pi's attempts to find God, even if it meant going to the other religions. It was more of a spiritual journey rather than religious, really, and there were several things that he learned from all three religions that I felt applied to life in general. I liked how Pi learned about God willingly, and I am pretty sure his earlier spiritual journey helped him in his predicament later on.I realized while watching the movie that being stuck in the middle of the ocean with no sign of help or no land is now my worst nightmare. When I am island hopping on vacations, I am always the one wearing a life vest, because I am not the strongest swimmer. In the book, I cannot envision how the ocean can be merciless because I kept on thinking of it as a calm ocean since they were in the Pacific, right? Then I watched the movie and oh my Lord, I never want to be in that situation ever. Especially with a bengal tiger, even if I love that animal.I found Pi's adventures in the middle of the ocean very interesting and I was really, really rooting for him to live. Or rather, I am really, really hoping Richard Parker the tiger would live in the end. I can just imagine the tiger in the story, and the visuals in the movie (even if the tiger is completely computer generated) helped me love Richard Parker more. Pi's adventures in the ocean had the most meat in it, I think, and there were so many, many things that got me even if I wouldn't even dare to be stuck in the middle of the ocean like him. Some of my favorite passages:It begins in your mind, always. One moment, you are feeling calm, self-possessed, happy. Then fear, disguised in the garb of mild-mannered doubt, slips into your mind like a spy...So you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you. (p. 161, 162)Despair was a heavy blackness that let no light in or out. It was a hell beyond expression. I thank God it always passed...The blackness would stir and eventually go away, and God would remain, a shining point of light in my heart. I would go on loving. (p. 209)It's important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse. (p. 285)The ending left me...reeling. A friend told me about the twist in the story, but I wanted to be surprised and boy was I surprised. I couldn't wrap my head around it for a while, and I had my first case of a book hangover for the year, which was extended right after watching the movie.I'm really glad I started the year with this one. 
Life of Pi
by Yann Martel is a beautiful book. It's not often a book leaves me with a delicious hangover that leaves me thinking and talking about the book after I was done. While it didn't exactly make me believe in God more than I already do, I think this is a book that speaks of hope and belief even in the most impossible situations. :)I meant to rate this four stars, but I am giving one full star for Richard Parker the tiger.

140,23961006,06/07/2008,4.0,"Life of Pi by Yann Martel is one of those novels that everyone and their mother seems to have read about 5 years ago, but ended up on my bookshelf, only to be overlooked and forgotten in multiple moves. I finally pulled it out to take with me on my trip to Houston and ended up absolutely loving it.Piscine Molitor Patel, known to ""all"" as Pi (i.e. 3.14), comes from a small Indian territory called Pondicherry. Son of a zookeeper, Pi has spent part of his youth exploring and practicing multiple religions, from his native Hinduism to Islam to Christianity. When Pi is sixteen, his family and their zoo animals emigrate from India to Canada aboard a Japanese cargo ship, which sinks along the way. Pi finds himself stuck in a lifeboat with a number of zoo animals, including a 450-pound Bengal tiger.The book tells more than the story of a stranded teenager and his ark full of animals. It is a look into religious beliefs and faith, the importance (or lack thereof) of material goods in one's life, and the indomitable will of human beings and animals to not only survive, but flourish under conditions of adversity. Pi's story is told non-linearly, with interruptions to recount stories of his past or accounts of interviews that occur in his future. Rather than detracting from the plot, this only serves to strengthen the story-line and give deeper emotion to every castaway scene the reader encounters.Yann Martel's prose is beautiful and humorous. Descriptions of the littlest thing can leave you wondering why you never looked at the item that way before, and his observations on people and religions are interesting and often profound. Pi characterizes scientists early on as:""I never had problems with my fellow scientists. Scientists are a friendly, atheistic, hard-working, beer drinking lot whose minds are preoccupied with sex, chess and baseball when they are not preoccupied with science.""But one of my favorite passages deals with his philosophical view of life and death:""When you've suffered a great deal in life, each additional pain is both unbearable and trifling. My life is like a memento mori painting from European art: there is always a grinning skull at my side to remind me of the folly of human ambition. I mock this skull. I look at it and I say, ""You've got the wrong fellow. You may not believe in life, but I don't believe in death. Move on!"" The skull snickers and moves ever closer, but that doesn't surprise me. The reason death sticks so closely to life isn't biological necessity-it's envy. Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly; losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud.""Life of Pi lends an element of the fantastic to the story, while at the same time appears as if the story could have be an all-too-real occurrence. The unique blend of zoological, philosophical, and religious insights draws you in and lets your mind chew on a heavy meal while your eyes hunger for the rest of Pi's castaway tale. It's a brilliant story by a wonderful storyteller, and one I'd recommend for anyone who wants a deeper look into the human condition.",12,0.9954,0.091,0.745,0.164,0.5257246376811595,POSITIVE,0.9958
141,25680984,06/27/2008,5.0,"The Riddle of LIFE OF PILIFE OF PI starts out with a promise of “a story that will make you believe in God;” a promise that the author admits is “a tall order.” Whether one’s faith is altered after reading Pi’s tale surely depends on each reader’s personal “input,” but I can not imagine anyone arriving at the end and not being wholly convinced of Yann Martel’s awesome story-telling ability.The author, who has allegedly pieced together Pi’s tale from various sources, basically allows Pi to tell his own story. In the first part of the tale, adolescent Pi explores various philosophies and religions and chooses to practice three simultaneously: Hinduism, Catholicism and Islam. His interfaith awakening – and people’s reaction to it – is both comical and touching. Strangely, although he is quite devout, Pi has no problem with atheists. He sees them as his “brothers and sisters of a different faith” and respects their firm convictions. Not so for agnostics like his own father. He has no patience for them and says (p. 28):“Doubt is useful for a while. We must all pass through the garden of Gethsemane. If Christ played with doubt, so must we ... But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.”Though Pi does not share his father’s view of religion, he does gain from him a love and respect for all animals as his father is the director of the Pondicherry Zoo in India. We learn a great deal about animals and humanity’s treatment of them and, despite Pi’s claim to the contrary, he gives some solid arguments in favor of zoos. Still, he admits (p. 19):“I know zoos are no longer in people’s good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.”In Part Two, Pi’s faith in God and humanity is tested in a most unusual way: He is the lone survivor of a shipwreck and ends up in a lifeboat with several zoo animals, among them a Bengal tiger. Here the tale becomes one of endurance and survival against all odds. Told in exactly one hundred (mostly) short chapters, the narrative provides a lot of information. Some of the details are graphically violent or just plain gross. But most often, Martel can devastate us with just a few words, as in Chapter 75, consisting of one sentence. Lost at sea, battling intense solitude, thirst and hunger, Pi reports:“On the day when I estimated it was Mother’s birthday, I sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to her out loud.”Pi’s adventure is in a sense an allegory, reminiscent of other epic stories like Jonah’s, Noah’s and Ulysses's. In the end, Pi survives. He triumphs over the elements, extreme hunger and thirst, a Bengal tiger, and unimaginable loneliness, fear and despair. What is it that saves him? Is it his faith? His imagination? Pushed to the limit, Pi goes blind and descends into madness. Shortly afterwards, though, he is saved. In a prescient moment at the beginning of his tale, Pi notes (p. 41):“All living things contain a measure of madness that moves them in strange, sometimes inexplicable ways. This madness can be saving; it is part and parcel of the ability to adapt. Without it, no species would survive.”Ultimately, the riddle of Pi’s salvation is left to the reader to solve. It is a riddle well worth contemplating and one which may require a second reading. ",12,0.9474,0.134,0.706,0.161,0.5047273982056592,POSITIVE,0.8542

143,9731048,11/29/2007,5.0,"Brady BurkeMrs. EbarviaHonors World Lit. – Pd. 511/28/37Book ReviewThe novel Life of Pi by Yann Martel is an intriguing and very interesting book about the journey of a teenage boy, Pi Patel, who is trying to find himself. Pi is a studious boy who practices not just Hinduism, but also Islam and Christianity. A zookeepers son, Pi finds himself being uprooted from everything he has known to move to North America, but when the boat sinks, Pi finds himself lost a sea in a lifeboat with a ferocious Bengal tiger, who are both trying to survive. Yann Martel was born in 1963 in Spain and studied philosophy before beginning to write. He has written many other published novels including The Facts Behind the Helsinki Raccomatios, The Third Brother, and Self. In this novel I enjoyed how the author did not simply write about Pi and his journey but he wrote about what Pi was thinking and how he was feeling. I found that what kept me interested and what kept me reading was how in almost every paragraph, the author would deeply explain everything Pi was thinking and what was going on around him with examples from religious scriptures, experiences, and different stories from all over. Although it is an intellectual book it was not a hard read and the way it was written flowed well and was easy to understand. My favorite part of the book was when Pi's experiences with all of the three religions were explained and analyzed. I enjoyed how the other not only wrote about how Pi and his mentors felt about it, but also about how his family and the people around him felt after they found out what was going on.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I did find that sometimes the author would stray to far from what was going on and you would lose sight of everything that was happening with Pi. As I said in the last paragraph, I did like how the author explained everything with examples, but some of them would be multiple pages long and it was easy to forget what was going on. I felt that sometimes during these points I lost interest. I think that it would help readers stay focused on the plot and the book, if he had written less or not used such extraneous examples. Although they give you much needed insight into the mind of the main character, they would still help even if they were not so long. In conclusion, I liked this book very much and would highly recommend it to all. Although sometimes it is easy to get lost, over all, this book is extremely interesting and exciting. I have found this book to be one of my favorites and I will probably read it again. This is one of those books that no matter how many times you read it, it will always be good. It is one of those books that when you just want something good to read at your local coffee house or when you go to bed, you will always want to pick up. This book is intellectual and exciting, and if you’re looking for a good book that is hard to put down, try ""Life of Pi by Yann Martel!",12,0.9983,0.031,0.786,0.183,0.4860857818304627,POSITIVE,0.9972
144,1618756347,06/20/2018,5.0,"At first glance, this piece of literary fiction is the story of Pi, son of a zookeeper, his spiritual development as a student of three religions and his memorable journey across the Pacific Ocean in the company of a 450-pound Bengal tiger, but it can also be read as a fable, metaphor, or commentary on the nature of humankind. Imaginative, compelling, at times gruesome, themes include storytelling, survival, and faith. The narrative provides a juxtaposition of animal instinct and transcendent faith, and how a person can inhabit both ends of the spectrum simultaneously. Each reader will likely have a different reaction to this tale, depending on his or her personal beliefs. At the very least, it provides much food-for-thought about the meaning of life. Content warnings include detailed descriptions of suffering and slaughter of animals, eating items normally viewed as grossly inedible, dismemberment, starvation, and bodily functions.

145,1653435526,11/03/2017,5.0,"Where to start? I think what I enjoyed most about Life of Pi was its ability to surprise me, which came from a combination of its refreshingly original premise, its use of an unrealiable narrator (a literary feature, which, if done well, I often enjoy), and the rather unpredictable and abrupt style of writing, which I felt fitted the voice of the slightly eccentric protagonist well. Of course this element will be lost on any readers who have seen the film, or already heard or read a lot about the novel beyond its basic plot. I found the bulk of the novel, detailing Pi's life aboard the lifeboat, to be highly readable and enjoyable, and I liked the way this adventure element sat (a little uncomfortably) alongside some of the moral and philosophical questions explored by the protagonist. On reflection, and this is entirely subjective, Life of Pi reminded me in many ways of To Kill a Mockingbird.",12,0.9476,0.041,0.792,0.167,0.5549999999999999,POSITIVE,0.6521

156,2907759,07/10/2007,2.0,"I love books about animals. This has a lot to do with my great-aunt Alice. Aunt Alice used to be an elementary schoolteacher and librarian, and she often whispered to us that Dad was her favorite nephew. Every Christmas that I can remember, growing up, we’d be sent home with a box full of old or damaged books that the school library didn’t want anymore, all about animals: Black Beauty, King of the Wind, The Incredible Journey, Charlotte’s Web, Lad of Sunnybank, Old Yeller, Where the Red Fern Grows, Lassie Come Home, and Beautiful Joe, among others. In each one, animals are the heroes of the tale, and are much more noble and beautiful than humans. Us humans like to think this about animals. Too bad that what we’d like to think isn’t always true.So, I really like how Yann Martel wrote about animals in this book — they are animals! — and I really like how he compared the way that animals behave with the way that humans behave, especially how we behave about religion. This is the best aspect of the book. The main character, an ardent practitioner of religion, is simultaneously Christian, Muslim and Hindu, but finds himself resorting to “animal behavior” in order to survive.I enjoyed reading it. He’s a good writer. Not great, but very good. He has a nice sense of humor, he writes good dialogue (which is difficult), and it’s a very interesting story that will hold your attention until the end of the book. I like how he wrote himself into the story as a character (I get all giddy and weak-kneed when authors do that). I also really like the way it ended.Complaints:1) Overall, the story seemed a little choppy; the three sections didn’t flow very well into each other and instead felt like three different books. I understand the point — the book starts out on a more “human” note, rather philosophical and intellectual, and then progresses to the more raw depiction of survival, so the tone and subject matter changes accordingly — but it comes off feeling like a bad editing job. Also, like I said before, he's not a great writer. A better editor would have made him better.2) It was really violent in places. I know that it had to be violent because animals are violent (kill or be killed!), but did it have to be that violent? There were one or two paragraphs that were so bad it made me nauseous. Great authors can do more with less.I’d still recommend it to most of my friends (except for those of you who can’t handle blood and gore).",11,0.988,0.098,0.714,0.188,0.5512321937321937,NEGATIVE,0.993
157,2234128303,12/31/2017,4.0,"I have got to say I really admired this book. Yann Martel is a wonderful storyteller. The characters and the situations were described quite vividly in this book. I believe that in an interview Martel mentioned that he had studied animals and their psychology and how they behave, he also studied religion as a whole while delving deep into many types of religion. His studies shine through as the reader experiences a new way of knowing how the animal kingdom works.The Author's Note is what actually captured my attention from the start. I have never been much of a what you would call, 'Foreword' or 'Author's Note' reader. However, this book just made me read and re-read this opening. It was so incredibly fascinating and it was so beautifully written that it made me excited to read the actual story that was ahead written by this author. Although the film was good, the book was exceptional.Pi was quite the hopeful character, given his circumstances. He fought throughout the story for his life and later for his survival and that is truly where the horror and excitement elements kicked in. The need to find out what happens and that itch to turn the page until you get to the conclusions keeps nagging until you find out. The thing is, with this book, the ending can be turned both ways. You can believe what is told in the story or you can believe the alternate ending that is also provided. The choice is left to the reader themselves. Me, personally? I would much rather choose to believe the fantastical story version as the other version with the facts is although much more believable, is frankly more depressing. So the latter gets a down-vote from me. Anyhow, that is only one person's opinion among many but as I have stated, this book is quite the roller coaster ride. It is not one of your normal adventure book with useless jump scares hidden but it makes you connect with the character and the story and the situations you are reading about. This connection is what keeps the story going. The only negative thing is that because this book is filled to the brim with information about various topics, the story in parts, seems to drag on quite a bit, but it doesn't do that in an off putting manner. It may just be somewhat overwhelming in some cases for some readers.Finally, I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to delve into something that gives them that adrenaline rush but all the while feel like they are learning new things and reading a beautifully crafted story.

164,674719630,07/22/2013,5.0,"Life of Pi. A beautiful reminder that when we lose everything, we might end up finding ourselves. As soon as I came to the part in the book where Pi is in a boat with a tiger, and I realised that still had many pages ahead, I thought: “well, this is going to be the tale of a boring kid in a boring boat with a boring tiger until he is either rescued or dead”.I couldn’t have been more wrong. To say that this novel tells the story of a boy in a boat with a tiger reduces into a lame survival plot all the effort the author makes for this book to convey a great deal of wisdom to the reader.Yann Martel manages to tell the same man vs. nature themed story in a completely new fashion, loaded with questions about life and death, beliefs, family and spirituality. Survival stories remind us not only that life is worth living but that we can cling to the desire to live as long as we can find a reason to keep fighting. But, what if the reason to stay alive is life itself? Pi reminds us that sometimes it is when we lose everything that we might find ourselves.I’m hesitant to define this tale as a religious one, yet it is deeply spiritual. Pi has a great heart and his soul (his mind, if you prefer) craves for knowledge, both physical which is clear by his interest in zoology; and metaphysical, which leads him to approach religion. Aristotle said that “All men by nature desire to know” and Pi’s desire to know is nothing else that this natural desire common to all humankind.I believe that what makes Pi different from other boys (and men) is the fact that he is able to realise that both the physical and metaphysical knowledge are rooted in a common true. The spiritual search of Pi is not the search of someone trying to find a messiah, nor of someone looking for a new lifestyle; it is a pursue of a higher truth. That’s the reason why he can be a pious Hindu. And Muslim. And Catholic. Because he understands that those three religions convey a single true message. “I told her that in fact she was not so wrong; that Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims” p. 49.Martel offers a novel with a powerful insight of a very smart and pious boy who clings to life while coexisting with a tiger in the middle of the ocean. The message is beautiful and clear, and the way in which this message is delivered is lovely. The author uses the languaje exquisitely: the words become overwhelming because of the deep meaning they convey and at the same time, are beautifully used to describe an imposing scenario.This is a book absolutely worth reading, I totally enjoyed it from beginning to end, loved the characters, the descriptions, and the hidden wisdom. Yes, it might be a little slow at first and the time spent in the sea too long, but it’s definitely worth it.

To be honest, I found the book to be obtuse, perhaps too clever by half. The religious aspects were lost on me. I have no idea what Martel was trying to say. I didn’t “grok” the religious allegories. Basically the kid was witness to unspeakable horrors and then enduring boredom. His coping mechanisms kicked in. I didn’t see a novel confirming the existence of God or the importance of faith in the midst of hopelessness. (view spoiler)[This was a story of tremendous suffering. A story about a positive, hopeful, intelligent young man of tremendous religious faith. In fact the young man had so much faith that he embraced several religions rather than to choose just one. A kid trapped in a boat with a psychopath who kills two people in front of him including his mother. The kid is ultimately forced to kill the psychopath and then deal with about six months of solitary confinement.  (hide spoiler)] When a person is peaceful, a pacifist and vegan and doesn’t have the years of experience dealing with the injustices and incongruousness of life and faced with dealing with the most horrific of circumstances; how does the mind adapt, cope and survive? How does the young man retain his humanity? (view spoiler)[By transforming his mindset/psyche/id into something he needs to survive (manifestation of a tiger) until he is rescued and can then become human again.  (hide spoiler)] Very heady stuff, which I can appreciate; but an affirmation or rebuff of organized religions? I totally missed that concept.In the end, I didn’t hate the book, but I didn’t love it. And it feels like I should have. I appreciate what the author was trying to do, but for me it was just barely a hit, or rather nearly a miss.Just shy of 3.5 Stars",10,0.9442,0.113,0.734,0.153,0.5045841392649904,NEGATIVE,1.0
167,1938413943,03/11/2017,3.0,"3 Stars - Good bookI did what no one should ever do - I saw the movie first. I know, I know I'm horrible but I bought it at Target for $5. I was weak. However, I will say that I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. It helped me better visualize the story. If you don't know, a large part of this book takes place on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean. I can picture that in my mind but 100+ pages of that could be monotonous. However seeing the movie helped me with the reading because I could pull scenes from the movie and really see the intricacies in the story. I will say that I liked the movie better than the book. The book is good, a solid 3 star book. The movie though, is so beautiful that I feel like I have to favor it. I rarely like the movie better than the book but this is one of those rare exceptions. (The only other movie I've liked better than the book, that I can think of right now, was Brooklyn by Colm Tóibín). I know the movie has a lot of CGI but it's stunning.Okay, now onto the book. I like the story. It vaguely reminded me of The Alchemist in that I'm sure that there's some deeper philosophical meaning. I didn't go too deep into analyzing it though, I thought about it but didn't go there. Maybe that's why I only rated it 3 stars? I know the author meant for there to be some deep connection between Pi's love/fascination with religions and what happened out in the Pacific. Of course there's the obvious connection between (view spoiler)[the story of the animals, Pi, and the boat versus what the Japanese investigators finally pull out of Pi - with actual people (hide spoiler)]. That specific connection makes the reader question (view spoiler)[which story is true (hide spoiler)]. I prefer the story with the tiger.I will say that Pi's fascination passion for religion and/or God isn't as strange as some of the characters make it seem. I understand albeit I don't necessarily relate to it. Do I recommend this book? Maybe. I think most people would prefer the movie (though I'm a visual person so...) but I'm sure there are plenty of people that would prefer the book. If you rated The Alchemist 3+ stars I think you might at least like this one. ",10,0.9976,0.018,0.79,0.192,0.5564204314204314,NEGATIVE,0.8476
168,161605990,04/17/2011,5.0,"Life of Pi is the second novel by Canadian author Yann Martel. This audio version is narrated by Sanjeev Bhaskar. It tells the story the 227-day ordeal, in a lifeboat with a 450 pound Royal Bengal tiger, of a sixteen-year-old Indian youth, Piscine Molitor Patel (Pi). It is told in three parts: Pi’s youth in Pondicherry at his father’s zoo and the Patel family’s decision to emigrate to Canada; the sinking of the ship and Pi’s sojourn on the lifeboat; and Pi’s interview by officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, in an Infirmary in Mexico; the author’s notes about his meetings with Pi, the Japanese official who interviewed Pi and the family friend of the Patel’s who first alerted him to the story, lend an authenticity to the novel. Martel’s story touches on theology, zoology, human behaviour, sanity and the will to survive, and his meticulous research into his subjects is apparent in every chapter. With lyrical prose, Martel describes Pi’s encounters with fish, turtles, birds and whales, as well as the quality of the sky, the sea and the wind. Pi’s experience with the floating algae island proves that anything that seems too good to be true, usually is. My favourite scene was the encounter on the seaside esplanade of Pi’s parents, the pundit, the imam and the priest, especially the effect of Pi’s last words on the holy men. The objections that the incredulous Japanese officials cite to Pi’s fantastic story are quite amusing; the alternate version that Pi offers them, on the other hand, is certainly sobering. Martel’s imagery is evocative: “I believe it was this that saved my life that morning, that I was quite literally dying of thirst. Now that the word had popped into my head I couldn’t think of anything else, as if the word itself were salty and the more I thought of it, the worse the effect.” And he occasionally has Pi very succinctly describing his predicament: “...to be a castaway is to be caught up in grim and exhausting opposites….” , “Life on a lifeboat isn’t much of a life.” There is horror in this story, but also much humanity and humour is laced throughout. Highly original, funny and thought-provoking.",10,0.962,0.026,0.89,0.085,0.389047619047619,POSITIVE,0.9948
169,2481750356,08/06/2018,4.0,"Definitely saw the movie WAY before I read this book. Didn't even know I owned it until last weekend. Oops?Life of Pi was a really good book. I enjoyed the movie so I already knew before diving into this book that I would've liked it. In this book, you will meet Piscine, aka Pi. I loved his POV so freaking much. Reading about this adventure was pretty interesting and intriguing - it was definitely a page turner. About Pi, well this book is about him being in a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger. However, getting to know more about him was the highlight of the book. He's Indian and multi-religious. I liked getting to know him because of his values and beliefs. Then there's his family and how they are all zookeepers. I have never been on a boat that big, like they have.. but I also have no idea how I would handle losing everyone and everything either. Waking up on a boat with a freaking tiger would have been interesting - like a hangover story.. but I probably would have shat in my pants too. I don't even like cats.. and a freaking tiger would have my shaking in my cowboy boots guys. Now the cat, aka the Bengal tiger, well - it had an awesome name. RICHARD PARKER. Sounds like a spider name really but I loved it. I hope my next dog has a grown up name like that.. but I also kind of want to name it Rufio. What those two go through in this book was entertaining to say the least. Battling with starvation in shark-filled water would be anyone's worst nightmare and it was amazing to see what they both had to go through and how they survived towards the end.Overall, I am glad that I finally dove into this book and now it kinds of makes me want to re-watch the movie.

177,52836934,04/15/2009,5.0,"The Search for the Better Story(A Book Review of Yann Martel’s Life of Pi)Life of Pi is many things. It’s zoology… it’s spirituality… it’s an adventure… it’s a survival tale… and most importantly it’s about faith.Part narrative, part discourse, Yann Martell tells the story of Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi as he should like to be called, and his atypical growing up years in Pondicherry as a young Hindu boy of devout, spiritual practice subscribing to two more religious beliefs, i.e. Christianity and Islam, and his scientific upbringing that provided him an understanding of wildlife and fondness for nature by means of the family-owned zoo.Political unrest makes the family decide to search for greener pastures, and so they sold some of the zoo animals, while keeping others and transporting it with them on their voyage to Winnipeg where a new home and a wealth of possibility for new experience and adventure await the Patels.As the Japanese cargo ship chugs its way to Canada, no religion, however, prevents the tragedy of its sinking caused by a late-night accident pulling with it to the bottom of the Pacific Pi’s family, their remaining animals, and everything he knew of his Indian home. Now a castaway in a lifeboat, his only companion a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450-pound Bengal tiger, Pi must not only count on his instincts to survive, but also his unwavering faith.Life of Pi is not only a book full of surprises, it’s also in a league of its own. Martel’s tone, fresh and youthful, is one of the qualities that first greeted me once I started to read it: it’s like getting an earnest handshake from a friend you just met, his hand’s firmness, Martel’s precise and richly detailed prose, makes you wonder as if you’ve always known him for a long time. It delivers the intended impression to make it last without being over-the-top.And lasts it did, for the Canadian writer’s wit is the book’s sustaining power all throughout — even after you close the book in reflection… or genuflection.Pi’s character just leaps out of the pages: his life, his experiences, his humiliations prompted by a burdensome and, I admit it, funny name (that sound likes “pissing”), along with the things he learns surrounds the reader. You can’t help it; the character just lives in your head. Honestly, from time to time, in quiet moments, I still think of him.Then the adventure of being marooned and lost at sea ensues, forming the central narrative of the book as well as its thematic underpinnings. It greatly reminds me of Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea. where man is pit against the unyielding and merciless power of nature. It’s a journey that warrants three hundred or so pages to be told and must be witnessed and lived wherein every page brings us to extremes for in Pi’s condition danger is found within and without. It’s on this section where the contrast of animal, brutal, instinctive nature is at odds with the human, civilized principled and controlled nature. However, when time goes, the possibility of rescue uncertain, and the situation more severe, the human expectedly deteriorates into animal — yet reversibly at times the animal becomes human.The scenario Martel throws at the reader is indeed quaint, but the bond it forms transcends between human and animal, perhaps even more for Pi’s fate, though he did not initially understand why, at the hands of the ocean’s benevolent hostility gave him the time (and the reader as well) to look closely at the world, our relationship to all life within it, even to know the face of God.While the reader can initially mistake that the book is written in the first point of view, I like to believe the story comes to us from the mind of the listener, the way a transcribed interview follows. The listener dictates the flow of the story, and proof of this is the side commentaries interspersed in the book.This significant narrative element then imposes why Martel throws a curve to the reader near Pi’s story’s conclusion. Whether one finds it frustrating or confusing, this is one of the most innovative way of delivering a book’s thematic thrust: the search for the better story. As Pi sees it, faith is built upon how we interpret and understand the world. Throughout the book we are left with a story so intricate in certain points, it even challenges one’s limit of credulity.All of this then turns into a choice: do we accept it or not?Can the essential truth, the vital message, take precedence over factual circumstances and scientific plausibility?This is what I only know for certain: renouncing essential experience to practical reality makes one lose oneself, one’s soul. Truth will never fit into a box or a mold one chooses to trust or believe.Pi deems God wants and believes the better story.At the end of Part One the author states: “This story has a happy ending.” Indeed it has, for whichever you chose, you choose your peace.Uplifting, heart-breaking, and mind-opening, Life of Pi is an inspired work conveying a life’s worth of contemplation expressing fundamental ideas with unmatched efficiency and purity.This is a part of

179,582398463,04/05/2013,5.0,"A Novel of Adventure, Survival, Companionship, and Belief in GodThe ""Life of Pie"" tells the story of a survivor of a shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean. We know he survived because of the Author's Note to start the novel told us. (You must read the Author's Note to understand what's happening in the novel.) Mr. Martel tells us about a man he encountered from Pondicherry, India told him, ""I have a story that will make you believe in god."" He was skeptical but assured by the man that this would be the case.Mr. Martel set the tone early.""My suffering left me sad and gloomy. Academic study and the steady, mindful practice of religion slowly brought me back to life.""Religion is a part of the story. It's a part of the narrator. It's a part of his life in India. It's a part of the survival on the boat. And it's a part of the story that may turn off many readers.There's a scene early on, after we learn how Piscine was named, and nicknamed, where holy men argue with themselves and Pi's family about his religious beliefs. It felt a lot like the jokes when you were a kid that started out with, ""The priest and the rabbi enter a bar..."" It felt satirical, though I'm not sure if it's Martel's voice or that of his narrator. It felt like we were being told, ""It doesn't matter which religion you follow as long as you believe in God.""Ravi, Piscine's older brother, had the following reaction to news that Pi was trying to follow multiple religions at once.""Ravi had a field day of it when he found out.""`So, Swami Jesus, will you go on the hajj this year?' he said, bringing the palms of his hands together in front of his face in a reverent namaskar. `Does Mecca beckon?' He crossed himself. `Or will it be to Rome for your coronation as the next Pope Pius?' He drew in the air a Greek letter, making clear the spelling of his mockery. `Have you found time yet to get the end of your pecker cut off and become a Jew? At the rate you're going, if you go to temple on Thursday, Mosque on Friday, synagogue on Saturday and church on Sunday, you only need to convert to three more religions to be on holiday for the rest of your life.'""And other lampoonery of such kind.""There are italicized chapters in the first part of the story, before the boat sinks, that pull the reader out of the story. I didn't mind them. It lent credibility to the narration of this tale being given to Mr. Martel, rather than Mr. Martel feeding us text. It attached emotions to the ""present day"" Pi and his family. In one of the present day scenes after the allegoric ones, there are references to the man still following several religions, which made me question whether the message was in fact meant to be satirical, or if we were supposed to believe that men of religion would act so over-the-top. I also found it odd that Pi grew up with a cosmopolitan family--neither the father nor the mother emphasized religious practice--yet as a young boy he felt a need to identify with God. (Perhaps that's the American in me talking, I don't know, but I was raised Catholic, and my mother had to pull me, nail marks on the floor, to get me to go to religious studies, lest I miss my Saturday morning cartoons...)The religious aspects of the novel quickly descend to the background, and once the boat sinks, you're there with Pi, the zebra (that poor zebra!), Richard Parker, the hyena, the gorilla, the turtles, the flying fish and the dorados. Every time I picked up this book I was back on the Pacific Ocean and while I never worried about Pi's survival I did worry about Richard Parker, and I wanted to find out what all they faced and how it all ended up. How did Pi make it to Canada?""Richard Parker has stayed with me. I've never forgotten him. Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart. I still cannot understand how he could abandon me so unceremoniously, without any sort of goodbye, without looking back even once. That pain is like an axe that chops at my heart.""The bottom line: ""Life of Pie"" was the winner of the Man Booker Prize, so you don't need me to tell you the writing is excellent; from the characterization and descriptive prose, to the pacing (a 319 page novel with 100 Chapters makes you feel like the story is flying, like those fish into Richard Parker's grasp) and the strategic use of repetition and foreshadowing, Mr. Martel's product is top notch. That said, if you are the type of person who can't stomach reading about religion, or even the hint that you should believe in God, move along; you'll hate ""Life of Pi."" But if you can suspend disbelief and take the religious symbolism for what it is, Pi's life will be a most enjoyable ride.-Raeden Zen",9,0.9808,0.063,0.847,0.091,0.3465534979423868,POSITIVE,0.9098

On surface the book looks like it's not for atheists - that it's a highly religious but it explores 'What place does the belief in God have in modern world?' and this question means a lot to me since I'm agnostic.Now, I say that the second story was much deeper and meaningful!! Weird! right? So let's recap there - there the animals are the humans - the Orangutan represents Pi's Mother, the Hyena is the Cook, the Zebra is the injured Chinese Sailor and Richard Parker, the Tiger is Pi himself not only that, the animals also personifies different emotional states that arouse during Pi's odyssey - for instance the Hyena represents selfishness, cruelty, violence; the Zebra for fear and pain; the Orangutan for nurturing love; Richard Parker for the insidious evil in the hearts of men also the Meerkats in the island stand for an eternal-awe towards nature and serenity.Here, Richard Parker is the inner hatred that Pi developed towards the cook when he killed his mother and that rage killed the cook. Now the thing with hatred is its keep you going however the odds, it gives one purpose to survive but it stays with one even after redemption as one is addicted to it and is in it's constant need that one feels secured with hatred. For e.g. Most of the POWs from WWII who've survived suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder when they return back to their normal lives and have continuous seizures of the episodes of violence that they were subjected to willingly or unwillingly. Thus Pi in his boat attempts to control his rage (i.e. Richard Parker) inorder to use that he succeeds to tame his anger (here 'tame' has a much more meaning as in the book 'Little Prince') and develops a friendly relationship with his own vice.The Island in the first story seems like a magical, heavenly place that is floating in the sea - is infact a metaphor for his own boat that Pi is used to hunting fishes and is away from land that he develops a philia towards the condition in which he is and is a stage in which he decides to remain there forever - for as we come across the Island, Pi comes to know that it is flourishing and nourishing in the day whilst carnivorous and haunting at night (notice how the swamps and puddles of the island turns poison at night so as to deposit dead big fishes that turns out breakfast for Meerkats) so that Pi realizes that all the comfort in it was temporary here - there are consequences for life and thus he moves on.At the end, Pi lets go of Richard Parker (i.e. his Hatred) on the land but though he feels deep sorrow for it - as that vice helped him to survive and it's extremely difficult to loose one's self - one's characteristics within.Alas, as the author meets Pi we see that he doesn't seem like a person who had seen his mother getting killed or the one that is subjected to cannibalism or with the killing - that he'd distorted his reality that he believes that things happened differently with animals and is also making others to believe the same - only because he had a faith in God so this book has to say that the belief in God can prevent one of being consumed by the evil.Now, the first version of the story almost feels like a biblical tale of survival especially the part of the island but now we know it represents something altogether different like the testament itself and other religious texts - like a believe it or not.The name 'Pi' itself represents an irrational quantity and like that the question of faith itself will keep on pondering endlessly.",14,-0.9971,0.169,0.727,0.104,0.4647159444329255,POSITIVE,0.9972

183,675505044,07/23/2013,4.0,"DISCLAIMER: This is a review of an audiobook.WHAT IS IT ABOUT?Yann Martel’s “Life of Pi” is an inspiring adventure novel about an Indian boy Piscine Molitor “Pi” Patel who survives in the Pacific Ocean for over seven months sharing a lifeboat with an adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. In the mid 70s, Pi’s father, the owner of the Pondicherry Zoo in South India, decides to sell the zoo and move with his family to Canada. Full of hopes and dreams, Pi’s family with their animals board a Japanese freighter “Tsimtsum.” Unfortunately, not long into its voyage across the Pacific Ocean, the ship sinks. Two hundred twenty-seven days later, Pi and Richard Parker, the only survivors of the shipwreck, reach the coast of Mexico. Pi’s adventure in the sea is both realistic and unbelievable, heartbreaking and uplifting, entertaining and thought-provoking.THUMBS UP:1) A captivating adventure.Since I knew beforehand that the majority of the book is devoted to Pi’s experience on a lifeboat, I was rather wary. I love action-packed adventures, but how adventurous can it get when you are floating in the middle of the Pacific for seven months? If you have similar doubts about this book, rest assured that it can get VERY adventurous, especially with an adult tiger aboard. At times I was so immersed in the story that I didn’t want to stop listening to it, even if it meant jogging an extra mile or volunteering to wash dishes.2) Educational and philosophical.Martel sneaked into his book a handful of interesting facts about zoology, survival in the sea, and even religion. As a result, I learned quite a lot without even noticing it! Besides being educational, “Life of Pi” is also quite thought-provoking as the author offers many philosophical ponderings on such timeless topics as freedom, perception, believability, fear, life and death.3) A game-changing ending.At the very end, the story abruptly transforms into something completely different from what it seemed to be. Such a transformation is so powerful that very few readers, if any, would remain unaffected by it. Indeed, “The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no?”4) Beautifully narrated.“Life of Pi” is written beautifully. Experiences of the castaway boy are so convincing and described so precisely that it’s hard to believe the author didn’t spend several months in the lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific himself. As appropriate for such a literary masterpiece, it is read beautifully as well, including all the sounds and different accents. Conveniently, the story from Pi’s perspective and occasional recollections of a visiting writer are read by two different narrators.COULD BE BETTER (MAYBE):I really like this book and generally dismiss any criticism towards it as precarious. However, when the narrator was reading descriptions of events or landscapes, my thoughts would occasionally wander off. Involuntarily, I started wondering whether I would get stuck at these places if I was reading an actual book.VERDICT: 4 out of 5“Life of Pi” is everything a good book should be: it is captivating, adventurous and beautifully written (and read!) as well as educational and philosophical. And the best part yet - it has a deeply moving ending.POST SCRIPTUM:Back in 2012 I also saw “Life of Pi” movie and I absolutely loved it!

184,25848324,06/29/2008,5.0,"Ever since I was young, I remember loving books about survival. In elementary school, I must have read Island of the Blue Dolphins about twenty times. I have read several other books in that genre, most recently The Hunger Games. There seems to be something about reading of another's survival, even in the most unlikely and fantastical circumstances, that draws people in.Life of Pi is unlike any book I have ever read before. I have met people who love it, people who label it as utterly confusing and leave it at that, and even some people who say it can make an atheist believe in God. It is a story that is up for interpretation, a story that has no correct answers.(view spoiler)[Which story do I believe is true? Honestly, I don't know. Believing the first story, the one with the animals, is clearly the more satisfying choice. The reader has been told only that side for 94 chapters (as the second story is only revealed in the last several pages). The second interpretation is more logical, as well as more grim. It makes sense that Pi would have dealt with such a great trauma by creating an illusion to live in for the 277 days he was at sea rather than accept the harsh truth. Could Richard Parker simply be an aspect of Pi's personality? Could the ongoing battle between boy and tiger be a metaphor for Pi's battle between the civilized and uncivilized sides of him?At the end of the book, Pi asks his interviewers (and the reader) which story was more appealing to them. The men, both logical people who do not seem to believe in miracles, chose the first story, although they do not believe it. Pi states, ""The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no? Doesn't that make life a story?"" (hide spoiler)]In all, I loved this book. It is one that makes you think, really think, and that's the main reason I love reading so much. Already I can't wait to re-read it. When I do, I'm sure I will have a different interpretation than I do now, since I now know and will be able to separate the two sides, the reality and fantasy. I recommend this book to anyone like me, who prefers thought-provoking stories to frivolous ones... just don't read it while eating. Trust me. You will lose your appetite faster than I can say, ""in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.""",9,0.984,0.065,0.809,0.126,0.493667328042328,POSITIVE,0.9247
185,1939776608,04/25/2017,5.0,"What can you write about being lost at sea with a tiger? From my limited imagination, I would have said not much, so it took me years – and prodding from my book club, which is reading Life of Pi in May – to do so. I'm glad I did, but I'm also looking forward to talking with them about it, as this is, I suspect, a book that can be read on many different levels.Because our May theme is religion and spirituality, I am perhaps primed to think about Life of Pi as a book about religion. On a superficial level, it makes sense to draw this conclusion. Piscine grows up Hindu – in a secular household. As a teen, Pi became also Hindu and Muslim, horrifying his spiritual leaders in each group. His view of religion was all-embracing, as when he called Richard Parker, the tiger, to his lifeboat: “Jesus, Mary, Muhammad and Vishnu, how good to see you, Richard Parker! Don’t give up, please"" (p. 137). Pi's perspectives on each religion are often characterized by a wry sense of humor that runs throughout this book. About Christianity: The first thing that drew me in was disbelief. What? Humanity sins but it’s God’s Son who pays the price? I tried to imagine Father saying to me, “Piscine, a lion slipped into the llama pen today and killed two llamas. Yesterday another one killed a black buck. Last week two of them ate the camel. The week before it was painted storks and grey herons. And who’s to say for sure who snacked on our golden agouti? The situation has become intolerable. Something must be done. I have decided that the only way the lions can atone for their sins is if I feed you to them.” (p. 76).Maybe another way of looking at looking at this book, though, is from the frame of the journey of the spiritual life, that Pi's religion helps him survive a very difficult time: I was alone and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging on to an oar, an adult tiger in front of me, sharks beneath me, a storm raging about me (p. 151). Difficult indeed, yet it seems that is a good characterization of life. When we have tigers in front of us, sharks beneath us, and a storm raging all around, what do we do? Can we hang on with the courage, grace, perceptiveness, and humor that Pi did?Yet another way of seeing Life of Pi, perhaps, is from a from a phenomenological perspective. Do we expect and accept only one story or recognize more than one? Do we recognize ourselves as meaning-making beings? If so, what stories do we tell about our lives? Do these stories help us carry on or make doing so more difficult? Will we, as Pi asked, lack imagination and miss the better story (p. 92)?",9,-0.9558,0.113,0.8,0.087,0.4838533114395184,POSITIVE,0.9257
186,595165929,04/19/2013,4.0,"A charming story with a fascinating nested narrative structure that features the unreliable narrator much like Gene Wolfe's stories, but more light-hearted. The story is about Pi, who grows up in Pondicherry, India, spending most of his time on his father's local zoo, and who is fascinated and drawn to three major religions, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. Being an innocent and open-minded young boy, he doesn't see anything wrong with worshiping all three in equal measures, but this doesn't go over well with his religious mentors when they find out.The story suddenly segues into a survival tale as Pi is stranded in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, orangutan, zebra and hyena. He endures tremendous hardships for a long time on the open seas, but his will to live prevails where many others may have given up, partly due to his faith.Early on, the narrator (the adult Pi) claims that ""this story will make you believe in God,"" and while this is a bold claim, especially for those already skeptical or outright hostile to organized religion, he is such a charming and earnest character that even a resolute atheist like me gave him the benefit of the doubt.The story (and movie by Ang Lee, which is very beautifully rendered) ends by offering two alternative versions of the story, one fantastic and the other grim and unpleasant, and proclaims that the reader may choose which tale they prefer to believe.So do all the fantastic events and Pi's stubborn insistence on religious belief make a case that logic alone is not sufficient to live a emotionally rich and fulfilling life? I think that depends on the already-held beliefs of the reader, and this book won't likely sway anyone except those teetering on the fence already. But this is perhaps the first book I've read that presents an open view of faith that isn't irritating or condescending, and if indeed the author is suggesting that one can and should worship all religions like the innocent Pi, well I would hazard a guess that it would certainly be an improvement on the long human history of religious intolerance and bigotry.Did it make me believe in God? No, not really, but I certainly enjoyed the story nonetheless.",10,0.9968,0.065,0.721,0.214,0.5887537993920972,POSITIVE,0.9943
187,1230068780,03/17/2015,4.0,"Initially, I did not love this story, but by the end, I had a serious change of heart. I think the problem is that the story doesn't actually start until about 1/3 to almost 1/2 of the way into the book. This left me feeling like there was no story and no plot. Had I begun reading in print, instead of listening on audibook in the car, there's a strong possibility I would have quit right before this book became dark, gruesome, and brutal, which was far more interesting. At times, the storytelling is long-winded, a bit preachy, and even tedious. It lacks subtlety and often hits you over the head with points, instead of letting you have a-ha moments. However, I have frequently found myself thinking about the different things I read in this story, so while some of it exhausted me, other parts clung to me. My suggestion is to push through the beginning, because things get far worse for Pi Patel, which makes the story much better. Honestly, when it goes into the endless chatter about religions in the beginning, you could probably skip 30-40 pages there and never be missing any parts of the real story. Had they started the book almost 100 pages later, it would be far better, though the commentary on zoos in the beginning is interesting, even if it's a bit lecture-like. From the halfway mark to the end, I was mostly captivated. The author still had moments where he kept repeating the same thing over and over and over again, ad nauseam, but by then, it felt more like a stylistic choice to drive his point home, though I could have done with a bit less of the pounding me over the head with things I already knew and understood. There were many things I enjoyed about this unexpected read, and I am glad I persevered. There's quite an interesting story hidden inside all the excess.

It was an adventure story (er...stories), nothing more to me. And goody for me, I love adventure stories.Pi Patel is a story lover and a storyteller. A spinner of yarns and a lover of all tales tall. He has read Robinson Crusoe three times. He fell in love with and began practicing three very different, very exclusive world religions (Hinduism, Christianity, Islam) because of their stories. Is it any wonder then, that Pi would concoct a magical story about the impossible? No, because Pi isn't interested in the truth and he doesn't believe most people would be either. Why? Because the truth doesn't make a very good story. Or, maybe he simply invented a story as a means to help him live with the truth and the part he played in it. Happens all the time.As for his claim that his story will make you ""believe in God,"" well, I don't think anyone would walk away believing anything more than what they walked in with...especially given that his ideas regarding non-belief/non-believers are so rife with error.Which story is better? Does it really matter? They both star Pi, as all people's versions of their realities do. Which do I prefer? Whichever one leaves out the eating of feces.

A lot of time was spent explaining why Pi observed three separate religions and how, in his mind, they didn't conflict with each other. Being a Christian myself, I was never convinced of his view, but I did find it very fascinating to hear the opinion of Christianity from someone who was raised in a different religion. Once the story of how Pi survived at sea after the ship he was on sank to the bottom of the Pacific got underway, the story became more interesting for me. Pi finds himself stranded aboard a small life boat with a tiger, a hyena, an orangutan and an injured zebra. It doesn't take long for Pi to realize that he is on the low end of the food chain and must devise a plan if he hopes to stay alive.

197,1112501115,11/22/2014,1.0,"I could stop simply by saying that this might be the most overrated book ever written, but why stop at ""overrated"" when there are so many better, more deserving adjectives to use when discussing ""Life of Pi""? Repugnant, vacuous, immoral, sycophantic, and- at all times- overbearing and preachy. In case that leaves you wondering to some degree as to what my real feelings are toward the book I'll rejoin simply by saying that this is a stupid book written for stupid people who, upon finishing it, will subconsciously pat themselves on the back for being so mindlessly subservient to the author's wishes. This book should have been called ""Life of Zero"" because its mindless little brown-noser of a protagonist is anything but a complex figure in need of deciphering. This is the kind of book that encapsulates the worst not just in literature, but in life and lest you think I've gone too far, pause and behold the gems Martel has shat on previously innocuous blank pages.We come to our first turd on just page 13 when Martel, speaking as Pi, writes; ""I have heard nearly as much nonsense about zoos as I have about God and religion. Well-meaning but misinformed people think animals in the wild are ""happy"" because they are ""free""'. Martel goes on to write that ""freeing"" an animal from a zoo would be the equivalent of: ""if you went to a home, kicked down the front door, chased the people who lived there out into the street and said, ""Go! You are free! Free as a bird! Go! Go!"" - do you think they would shout and dance for joy? They wouldn't."" What a horrible, half-baked comparison! He goes further on the following pages, writing ""one might even argue that if an animal could choose with intelligence, it would opt for living in a zoo, since the major difference between a zoo and the wild is the absence of parasites and enemies and the abundance of food in the first, and their respective abundance and security in the second. Think about it yourself. Would you rather be put up at the Ritz with free room service and unlimited access to a doctor or be homeless without a soul to care for you? But animals are incapable of such discernment."" What Martel is then positing, through his sad-sack protagonist, is that animals actually want to be captured and locked in cages, they simply lack the intelligence to tell us so. And zoos by extension have the right to enslave as many of these creatures as they want, they should even be thanked for doing so! All of us poor, ""misguided"" souls who would say otherwise are no better than home invaders. One wonders how Martel's defense of the capture of all non-humans would hold if, say, it were extended to cover minorities, or women. After all, wouldn't we all rather have someone else feeding and cleaning after us, tossing aside the mere fact that along with our motivation to earn a living and feed ourselves we will have tossed aside our freedom as well? In case he hasn't already, Martel makes the motivations of his dung-heap of a novel clear on the following page, writing; ""But I don't insist. I don't mean to defend zoos. Close them all down if you want (and let us hope that what wildlife remains can survive in what is left of the natural world.) I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.""With just one paragraph, Yann Martel lays his cards on the table. ""Freedom"" itself is an ""illusion"". Who needs it when you've got zoos and religions? I am at least grateful for Martel for making so clear what the two have in common. Both involve beasts of a certain sort serving at the whims and desires of a greater master. That I should draw a comparison between Martel's rejection of ""freedom"" for animals to his rejection of the same freedom for humans shouldn't be cause for finger-pointing or accusations of exaggeration, the above quotes make clear that Martel himself is the one making the comparison and if that isn't clear enough, this is a book in which each animal is revealed not just to symbolize but to serve as a stand in for a human character. The people that gobble up Martel's pseudo-spirituality are the same that eagerly digest the works of Paolo Coelho and feed off the self-help section of their local bookstore. As for this ""story that will make you believe in God"", it is ultimately unclear at all which of these unappealing ""lessons"" should cause you to turn from your heathen ways and run to the embrace of a ""creator"" who will just as soon put you in a ""cage."" By its own telling, the story ought to make you believe in a deity because oh, isn't it so much lovelier believing in fairies and wood-elves than in thinking them non-existent? Again, such platitudes are likely to work only on the infantile and naive. It would be one thing were Martel's protagonist to be dealt some life-lesson over the course of the novel, or were he to be shaken up at last and wisdom allowed to enter his dense skull. No such change occurs. ""Pi"" is as childish and foolish at the story's conclusion as he was at its inception. And it isn't just the morale of the thing that left me cold. Martel is perhaps the only writer able to conceive a story in which a boy and a tiger share a life boat but nothing worthwhile happens. The writing is childish, the ""struggle"" for survival nothing you haven't seen or read many, many times before, and the ultimate conclusion nothing that you haven't painfully witnessed in person at any church service. By the time Martel whacks you up the head for the umpteenth time, preaching like a televangelist feeding on the unfettered souls of the innocent, you've long since given up caring.

Below are some comments I made while reading.Life of Pi has me in a state of awe over the obvious intelligence of author Yann Martel. So far he has me spellbound by his wonderful prose and his deep interest in his subject (e.g., zoo animals, among other subjects) and his ability to instill that interest in the reader.Right now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a tiger! He's trying to figure out a way to stop the tiger from eating him. He tells you all about it. Pi is an intellectual, like the author, Yann Martel.If you like learning about animals, you will like this book.Not only is it a good suspense story, but it's told in a unique way. You feel as if Pi is telling you the story, one on one. The book has that kind of intimate feel to it. Hard to explain.About Life of Pi, there are parts of it that seem like science fiction. What a great imagination the author has! The book is full of surprises. A very unusual presentation.I'm at the end, but will read the beginning again to cement my understanding of the entire storyline. There were some vague parts in the beginning (purposely so, I surmise). As you read, those parts become clearer. I'm very impressed by this book and recommend it highly.Believe it or not, I'm still finishing up the last few pages of _Life of Pi_. It's still full of surprises!BELOW ARE SOME SLIGHT SPOILERS BUT THEY DON'T TELL THE ENDING OF THE STORY:Before I started reading this book, I had heard about the tiger in the lifeboat with a boy. I wondered how that could have happened. In case you want to know... it's not really a spoiler, but perhaps you'd like to find out on your own... (view spoiler)[It happened while zoo animals were being transported across the ocean and the ship sank. (hide spoiler)]Did you know that the protagonist, ""Pi"", took on that nickname because his real name was an embarrassment? * So he told people his name was ""Pi"", as in the math pi symbol which stands for 3.14...http://www.gradeamathhelp.com/math-pi...By using the pi symbol to explain his nickname, he insured that folks would remember his name. Clever boy!I'll try to duplicate the symbol here: πWiki says: Pi represents ""the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter...""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi(I used to know more about this.) LOLOf course, ""pi"" is the 16th letter in the Greek alphabet.Martel explains all this so much better! LOLHe says that the symbol for pi (π) ""looks like a shack with a corrugated tin roof"" (p.24). How's that for a simile! :)ABOUT THE MOVIE ADAPTATION:Edit - 1/19/13:There is now a 2012 film version of this book:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454876/http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Life-of-...Edit - 4/20/13I finally saw the movie adaptation of this book. I think they did a good job with it.IMO, the movie can be better appreciated if the book is read first.I agree with the following comments by several Netflix members:====================================""A powerhouse blurring the line between natural wonder and hallucinatory beauty. Surprisingly philosophical ..., the movie tackles topics of God and faith with elegance and heart, with symbolism and subtlety begging for repeated viewings.A visual phantasmagoria with inspiring spirit at its center."" [bolding of the text is mine]""The movie was visually amazing... """"... the animals are not real, but are computer generated images used in a powerful way to drive forward the drama and action.""====================================I didn't see it as a story about religion or faith especially. Instead it goes beyond that and gives a wider philosophical scope. The character, Pi, is immersed in all religions due to his background. He accepts all the different gods including Jesus because he has a broad view of life. So no one religion is embraced; instead he seems to make use of all religious ideas and adapts them to his own world view. In the movie he says: ""Faith is a house of many rooms"". I get the sense that we all choose our own illusions. And yet, Pi says that his story will make the listener believe in God. I didn't find that to be true.At the end of the movie it is suggested that the viewers choose whichever version of Pi's story they prefer. He presents a couple of versions, one being the symbolic approach. Pi says: ""And so it goes with God."" Food for thought!!!ADDENDUM - JAN. 1, 2016:At FunTrivia.com I found the following interesting statements:""On the surface, ""Life of Pi"" by Yann Martel seems for the most part like a story of a boy shipwrecked on a lifeboat with a tiger.

If anything, it is a novel that is supremely balanced in its elements, and so likely to please most people. But, for some reason, I feel like giving a very nitpicky critique of the book. It will likely contain some spoilers.Plot: Martel gives us a new twist on an old yarn. Adventure stories on the high seas have been a staple of Western literature since the very beginning; it’s a genre that has been done by Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe, Ernest Hemingway, and Jonathan Swift, and shipwrecks play a pivotal role in many of Shakespeare’s plays. So it is impressive that Martel manages to be so original.Language: Martel is a novelist with poetic ambitions. He mostly succeeds, but often falls flat. His strong point is his use of details—he uses the right ones at the right times. His weak point is his use of similes. Martel uses similes like a cook uses heat. Everything that Pi sees, hears, or touches is ‘like’ or ‘as’ something else. It’s a bit much. My favorite is when Pi compares the tiger's paws with two Encyclopedia Britannicas. Not exactly terrifying.Characterization: Martel gets mixed marks here. Pi is a fantastic character, and the reader really gets to know him. But Martel fails with everyone else. This is partially due to his greatest weakness: dialogue. Martel is terrible at writing dialogue. Just open up the book to a bit of dialogue to see what I mean. He just has no ear for it. Even when Pi is talking to himself it comes out stilted and unnatural. This weakness is so apparent that Martel must be acutely aware of it—in fact, I think this is why he chose to write a novel with a plot that requires almost no interaction. The reader is not upset when Pi’s family perishes because we didn’t get to know them.Theme: Aside from plot, theme is the other major pillar of this book. Martel weaves some interesting reflections about religion, life, nature, God, and fiction into the narrative. Unfortunately for him, these musings aren’t as deep as Martel hopes. I think he was aspiring to integrate some existentialist philosophy, but what the reader gets are half-digested and vomited-up bits of William James’ and Joseph Campbell’s reflections on religion. And these aren’t exactly nourishing.What is worse for Martel, he trips over his own theme by the end. Near the beginning of the novel, Pi rails against agnostics, saying that they are too unimaginative or cowardly to take the leap that atheists and religious people take. However, at the end, Martel presents us with a choice: the story with or without the tiger. If we are to abide by his atheist/religious dichotomy, the reader should make the clear leap to one of these two stories. But what most readers do, I suspect, is go the agnostic route—not choosing which one they absolutely believe. As a matter of fact, the story is much richer when the agnostic route is taken, which, to me, destroys the entire message of the book. Oh well.Final Analysis: I’m taking the time to present this analysis because I think this book could have been so much better. Now, it is merely an excellent novel. But I really believe it could have been a modern classic.I’m just speculating here, but hear me out. I think Martel wrote this novel too early in his career. He was reaching too high, and he wasn’t ready for it. This is why there are many points when he comes across as a teenager wearing daddy’s cloths. The book could have used some more digestion, some more editing, and some more development. I don’t mean length, but depth.And because he spent this idea too soon, when it was not yet ready, Martel will never be the great writer he could have been. I would be willing to bet money that his future books won't even approach this one in quality. This makes me a little sad… But, like I said, it’s still a good read.",8,0.9936,0.063,0.797,0.14,0.5118710575139147,NEGATIVE,0.9983

“To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.” 
Una increíble sorpresa fue este libro. Admito que vi el trailer de la película y dije ""TENGO que verla"" y después supe que era un libro y dije ""TENGO que leerlo""  y nunca imagine que se elevaría hasta ocupar un lugar entre mis favoritos (no cualquiera lo logra).Recuerdo las cosas porque he visto mucho la película. El libro solo lo leí una vez y de hecho me urge una releída para hacerle la reseña como Dios manda :D Pero se hizo una excelente adaptación para los que aun no la han visto, háganlo! Es divertida, linda, triste, y con unos efectos preciosos. Pi, nuestro protagonista es un gran personaje que nos lleva en esta aventura sobre lo que significa ser humano, y todas las complicidades que eso arrastra. 
""So tell me ... which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with the animals or the story without animals?"" ...""The story with animals is the better story.""""Thank you. And so it goes with God.""
En fin, es una gran analogía sobre el comportamiento humano cuando esta en su estado de supervivencia. Entender como se ve Pi a si mismo al final del libro te rompe el corazon, de hecho el final cuando se cae todo el teatro y te lanza la realidad a la cara te quedas en estado inconsciente completamente. Llore muchisimo, pero a pesar de eso, es una historia bellísima, contada de manera increíble y hasta con datos reales sobre animales, etc.

That isn't to say that it isn't on the verbose, rambly side, but that's how I write, and as I was reading this book I thought, I love this book! And this is exactly how I would write this book! Okay, I was tricked too. I totally thought this was a real story, even though I believe it says on the back cover that it is a fictional tale, and I think I even read that back cover twice. It is such a detailed and fun story, and many events that take place in Pi's life prepare him for his big adventure. Hence, the main premise is that it is a story that will make you believe in God, because it was almost like he was prepared to face these obstacles. It can be thought of as life-affirming and testimony affirming. I will not lie to you, parts of the book are kinda gruesome, as it IS a survival story, and a person has got to eat, whether it is raw fish or a bird or sea turtle here or there.

Martel is a great story teller. - the way Martel views and turns to religion is refreshingly astonishing and soothed my soul. because I see things in the same manner. it is a very contemporary issue. religion could be a good thing, nowadays is a means of spreadig hatred, gender disequity, wars. Religion and oil are the two main causes of war. - the main story is very realistic described. and also the alternative stories. Martel doesn't make it easy for the reader.

He talked about religion and why he incorporated Hinduism, Christianity and Islam in his book, and he talked about his experience of wanting to write a book set in India!

219,20106669,04/13/2008,4.0,"Is it possible to recommend heartily a book that I almost stopped reading on three separate occasions? Based on some amazing recommendations for this book, I broke some of my book-buying rules. So utterly assured was I that this book brimmed with potential to become my new Favorite Book For A Few Months that I bought the book instead of checking it out from the library. In addition, I purchased the hardback and not the paperback - that hasn't happened for a very long time - harkening back to our (halcyon?) DINK (Double Income - No Kids) days as a family. And, to top it all off, the artist in me decided to go with not only the hardback but a special edition, illustrated hardback copy of Life of Pi. I had invested heavily, in a kind of relative book kind of way, that I would really like this book.Imagine my disappointment and growing annoyance when this book started off like nothing special at all and continued on its lackluster little path for 95 freakin' pages! I definitely would have stopped reading this book and moved on to many other tempting titles that I bought recently on a book-buying binge, but I kept thinking about how much I wanted to like it. I'm also a little stubborn about the money potentially wasted and more so that - I would have had to admit defeat to a book if I stopped reading it, so I just spent a month making myself keep reading a very plain book. All the while I was wondering if my friends, the reviewers at both Amazon and Powells, and the 2002 judging panel for the Man Booker Prize were literary idiots or liars for overselling this lame book. That seemed so unlikely, but this book starts out and stays blah for so long that I was wondering what was up.The first part tells the story of the sadly named Piscine Molitor Patel. The one interesting section of the dud first part of the book was the story of how he masterfully recreated not only his name but his peer's perception of him in an environment almost as daunting as the desolate sea - his primary school/jr. high environment. He was named after a pool that was revered by influential family members. Being named after a pool was strange enough, but he had to suffer humiliation at the hands of several tired teachers through the years accidentally called him ""pissing"" instead of Piscine. This slip of their collective tongues throughout the years was not lost on his classmates. He reinvents himself dramatically on the first day of class into Pi Patel. This tenacious spirit seen in his earlier years alludes to the potential he is forced to realize in his grueling marathon fight for survival while adrift for so many months later after a tragic accident at sea.Pi as told through Yann Martel's narrative voice is so convincingly Indian in nuances and phrases that for the first section of the book, I found myself reading the dialogue between Pi and his brother and parents in an Indian accent in my head.One interesting facet to this first part of the book is that he considers himself an equal adherent to three very different religions simultaneously - Christianity, Buddism, and Islam. It felt like a less-interesting version of some of the spiritual explorations more expertly chronicled in the novel Eat, Pray, Love. Also, this thread was not carried through with any significance in the other sections of the book, so I wondered why it was in there at all. The forgettable story really picks up once his family decides to pack up and sell the family zoo and relocate to Canada. The book's shift from ho-hum to mesmerizing is thankfully immediate and continual. There are several amazing things that happen in the book at this point. Pi is thrown by adults with questionable motives into a lifeboat with some unimaginable seafaring companions - a 450 pound Bengal tiger from the zoo named (comically) Richard Parker, a hyena, and the prized zoo orangutan. Pi transitions through disbelief of his situation to acceptance as the only way to survive and truly amazes me as a solitary little jr. high McGyver on the Pacific. He tames Richard Parker, goes blind, learns how to survive with continually dwindling supplies, strength, resolve, and peace. It might have been the amazing description of his collection of Richard Parker's poop that swayed the judges to hand Yann Martel the prize. This infrequently-traveled literary topic is written in such a funny way that any other authors considering attempting similar coverage (and you KNOW they are legion) should just give it up now - they can't compete.Another favorite selection of the book was the description of a villanous hyena early in the lifeboat section of the book. He wrote that the hyena's thick neck and high shoulders that slope to the hindquarters look as if they've come from a discarded prototype fo the giraffe.His casual approach to sharing arcane yet fascinating animal knowledge and patterns was very interesting throughout the book. It's such a foreign, specialized area of expertise but you feel smarter and more knowledgeable once you learn more about the classifications, alliances, tendencies, and processes of so many different animals.Traveling with the endearing Pi through the beginning of his amazing journey and seeing him mature through the most unusual, accelerated way - surviving the elements for many months at sea while cohabiting with a Bengal tiger - took two strange and unwelcomed turns near the end of the book.His boat finds a fantasy-based island that becomes even more incredible the longer he stays there. Being a Lost fan, I wondered if at any minute he might find the distinctive black character on a white background indicating that this land mass was a remote satellite of the Dharma Initiative. This was annoying to me and planted some small seeds of betrayal that such a tremendously enjoyable story would shift strangely into a section that seemed frustratingly vague in believability.So, with this mindset, the very last section of the book set off a big ol' stinkbomb that slightly tainted retroactively my perception of the part of the book that I had heartily enjoyed until the end. It employed the most hackneyed of sitcom cop-out endings - the ""waking up and realizing it was all just a dream"" ending that leaves you feeling cheated even in an episode of The Facts Of Life, but seems so grossly inappropriate in this book.I was wondering as I was reading how a story that got more and more fantastic in scope could finish itself off in a satisfying way, but of all the options, I don't understand how this one could be chosen in the author's mind as the best. It ended with an interview that was written in interview form. This is a writing format that I never find enjoyable in magazines, but what is it doing here? Pi was anti-climatically rescued off the coast of Mexico, and two Japanese insurance adjusters interview him to try to find out more details of their main financial interest, the reason his family's ship, the Tsimtsum, wrecked.In the course of this interview, lots of gratuitously unnecessary dialogue is exchanged between the two interviewers and Pi. They aren't believing Pi's recollection of his amazing survival, and then, when goaded into telling something more believable, Pi essentially retells the story in a condensed version with people representing each of the animal characters of the first version. It just felt wrong and like a big misstep in the book to end such a great story with ambiguity and a different tone than the rest of the best part - the middle shipwreck part of the book. Did Yann Martel give so much of himself to the other section that he was spent at the end and hired a much lesser ghost writer to finish it off? So, to wrap up - first part uninteresting and mostly forgettable - larger middle part really amazing and worth it - and last part - incredibly disappointing. But, the middle part was so very good that I still recommend it with the abovementioned qualifying asterisks.",7,0.9991,0.086,0.752,0.162,0.4919766344766342,NEGATIVE,0.9998

LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
I came across this book in oil painting class. I was dabbing my paintbrush in all those wondrous colours on the paint pallet; painting was just not my thing. I was about to die of boredom when something in the corner of my eye with more vibrant colours caught my attention. It was a book, and I swear it was love at first sight. The cover was just. So. Breathtaking.Hello, please notice me. DEAL.It belonged to a friend, and sadly she refused to lend it to me. Maya doesn't care. Maya will get her hands on that book.So back in those days, my neighborhood didn't have a local library (it still doesn't). My mother ordered it online, and I don't think I've ever anticipated the arrival of a book so much before. On Christmas morning, IT WAS LYING AT MY FEET CAN YOU IMAGINE NBDBFWBIIKCBbkhbsh!!!! There was a slight problem, however. It looked something like this:Oh, whatever, who cared? I did but let's not talk about it. To be honest I grew to love the cover as soon as I watched the movie.I went on a journey. Mamaji taught me to swim. Santosh Patel fed a live goat to Mahisha in front of my very eyes. Gita Patel taught me her words of wisdom. I hung on Satish Kumar's scientific inquiries. I cried with Pi as he watched the ship sink and I gasped in shock when Richard Parker revealed himself on the lifeboat.Okay, let's talk about the book.Piscine ""Pi"" Molitor Patel was named after a swimming pool in France. He suffered the nickname of ""Pissing"" at his previous school but nevermind that. He lives in Pondicherry, where the first part of the novel takes place. The lad grew up in a zoo and being the son of the zookeeper, he takes his time and educates us about animals; both domesticated and wild. We are taught how to control them and told how a lion tamer declares his dominance so that the animal stays obedient *hint hint foreshadowing cough*. As he grows up, Pi goes in search for God. This is where spirituality comes in. Pi was initially a Hindu, but he comes to embrace Christianity's message of love and Islam's devotion. The boy becomes a member of all three religions and he is pretty content with himself but others aren't. The priest, the pandit, and the imam confront his parent's when they find out Pi has been participating in activities in each other's churches. They bicker and force him to choose one and Pi declares that he was only trying to love God.Pi and his family leave for Canada and that's how the first part of the novel ends. They board a Japanese cargo ship along with the animals they planned to take and 'Noah's Ark' much??? Pi looks forwards to a new life but NO.""The ship sank"" is the first sentence of Part Two.So Pi is in a lifeboat with a zebra (injured), a hyena (annoying little bully), an orangutan (sweetheart), and out jumps a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Eventually, Pi and the tiger are the only ones left in the boat (don't ask me why you should know yourself). The rest of the book is just Pi's story of his days at sea. 227 days, to be exact. We get an insight of his emotional struggle and our hero is determined to live. He has to takes care of himself AND the tiger which is a very hard job but HE DID IT. Fish, shark meat, turtle meat, rain water. Pi is amazed by God's creation and creatures and he abandons vegetarianism to survive. His actions become more animalistic, however.The thing about Yann Martel's storytelling that makes is so powerful is that he keeps this super long voyage at an interesting pace. I don't know why but I never got tired of Pi's lectures on turtle meat.

What Do You Choose to Believe?
Piscine Molitor Patel - what a name! The novel describes an incredible journey of this eclectically religious fifteen year old boy. The author claims that it is a story that will make you believe in God. It is an exploration of life and belief in religion (and hope).Plotting and Pacing AroundThe plot is wonderfully inventive - whilst moving an Indian zoo of animals across the ocean, a Bengal tiger, a fifteen year old boy, hyena, orangutan, and a zebra become shipwrecked and must fight against themselves and the sea for survival. There is a minor spoiler at the beginning in that the narrator visits Pi, who then recounts his story. So somehow, through the storm, shipwreck, and sea, we know that Piscine Molitor Patel makes it out alive against all the odds. The setting is very appealing and adventurous.The constant struggle between boy and tiger dominates the narrative throughout and this tension kept me hooked most of the time. However, I did find the book a little slow to start with and there pacing issues in the middle too. I don't think this was supposed to represent how bored one can be at sea, but at least now I have some idea!Religion, Belief, and all that JazzYann Martel repeatedly pushes our bounds of belief, making Pi's story increasingly extraordinary and implausible. At some point, we must really question what is real. (view spoiler)[Was there really a floating island full of meerkats? Did Pi really bump into a blind Frenchman in the middle of the ocean? At the end, the Japanese Ministry of Transport Officials manage to worm an alternative story out of Pi, offering the opposite to the beautiful inspiring story with the animals; a dark and brutal reality, much more believable, but much more difficult to accept. (hide spoiler)]Overall, this is a great story of inspirational hope, courage, and determination in the face of despair. I really do like the stark choice Yann Martel invites us to make at the end (view spoiler)[between the two stories (hide spoiler)] - representative of how we choose to see our life. Do we choose to believe in what may be a little more plausible but pessimistic, or what is perhaps less believable but more fulfilling? Perhaps the author is asking us to stop relying on our own reason and instead take a leap of faith to fill in the grey areas and believe the something more magical, as it is so much more fulfilling.Detailed Waves in the WritingThe descriptions in the book are vivid, of the zoo, of Pondicherry, of Pi's childhood, really immersing you into Pi's narrative. How Yann Martel depicts the dramatic events in the novel is exquisite yet very relatable.A small detail is that Pi is shipwrecked for 227 days - a prime number, similar to the number pi which is an irrational number. Each of the 227 days represents something separate and indivisible. In addition, this irrational number Pi goes through such an irrational journey and is trying to make reason of it himself throughout.Another fine detail is the name of the tiger, Richard Parker. In a very famous English Law case - R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) - involving four shipwrecked individuals in a boat, three of whom (sailors) eventually succumbed to cannibalism, killing off the fourth, a cabin boy. This cabin boy's name was none other than Richard Parker. (view spoiler)[ Although Richard Parker is the name of the tiger and the cabin boy, perhaps this cabin boy is similar to Pi lost at sea. Indeed, in Pi's alternative story without animals, Richard Parker the tiger could represent Pi. (hide spoiler)]Reaching Land - ConclusionI liked the ambition in the novel, trying to cram so much allegory, symbolism, and metaphor on life and religion. Each animal and detail of Pi's story are metaphors with so much scope for interpretation. However, the execution leaves a little to be desired, it did feel a bit messy and contrived at times. Lastly, Martel's take on religion is not entirely accurate as an alternative to reason.(view spoiler)[So which story do you prefer? Which story do you believe?

225,298297404,03/21/2012,2.0,"Before I explain why I only gave ""Life of Pi"" two stars, let me say that I actually thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority of this book. It was suspenseful, evocative, and downright magical, with prose that engaged and transported. All in all, it was well on its way to becoming a five-star book in my personal library, one that I'd always look back on with wonder and awe. And then the author completely ruined it in the last few pages. Don't worry, that was not a spoiler of any sort – there was no sudden plot twist, deus ex machina, or giant revelation of anything that was would surprise the intelligent reader. Nor was it the kind of book ending that unerringly pisses me off: when the author purposely leaves the finale completely open-ended as a lazy way to make sure that film rights are sold because OH, THE SEQUEL POSSIBILITIES! (I'm looking at YOU Anne Rice for 
The Witching Hour
 and Michael Crichton for Jurassic Park.) No, in my opinion, this book committed an even more serious crime. The wonderful thing about great fiction is that it's bigger than just its plot. Themes and morals and underlying meanings are woven throughout, for the reader to tease out and interpret. Even very young readers are able to do this – the fairy tale ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" doesn't need to add a sentence at the end that says, ""And so, little boys and girls, the moral of the story is: don't lie! Because if you do, no one will believe you when you are telling the truth!"" That sort of ham-fisted approach actually detracts from the impact of the story. What's that old writing class adage, ""Show, don't tell""? But that is exactly what happens in the very last few pages of ""Life of Pi"", and it's not even subtle – it's as loudly spelled out as in my children's fairy tale example above. ""Here, dear readers, let me break the fourth wall and change the entire personality of my main character to turn him into a Greek chorus, so as to explain to you what the theme of this book is! First of all, I assume you were too stupid not to have figured any of it out on your own, so now I will even go as far as to tell you which exact not-particularly-spiritually-profound-despite-the-book-cover philosophical dichotomy (because I decree there are only two options) you should be considering, and, in fact, which of the two worldviews you are obligated to hold! There!"" Seriously. It was that blatant, that spelled out, and exactly that condescending to his readers, with no room left at all for concluding his (completely telegraphed anyway) moral, let alone – god forbid – have the room to explore any other themes we might find in the story. Nope, it's all conveniently spoon-fed to us. This book is often referred to as a parable. Parables actually require interpretation and reflection to appreciate their symbolism and meaning. ""Life of Pi"" may have started out as a parable, but the author apparently got cold feet at the end, and, underestimating both his own and his readers' ability, turned it into a manifesto. If Martel had handled the very last few pages differently, (view spoiler)[by changing the scene with the insurance investigators so that Pi does not suddenly and with no previous warning now view his world in stark black and white, letting the ""alternative storyline"" be surmised by the insurance investigators instead of pontificated by Pi, and leaving out the damn editorializing about which is the ""better story"" and why,  leaving it instead as an exercise for the reader (hide spoiler)], then this book would have been a gratifying, five-star read.",7,0.7617,0.053,0.888,0.059,0.4921475953565506,NEGATIVE,0.9998

!)Let it be known that I love tigers. In fact, tigers are my favorite animals. I have stuffed toy collections of them, and up until high school, I slept with them all around me in the belief that they will scare away whatever evil being that plans to visit me in the night. To be honest, that was the thing that drew me to this book, above all. It all began when I was 11, and my class had a field trip to Subic. My friends and I dared to take a picture with a tiger cub named Eo (the size of which was too big for a cub, in my opinion), and I was the one who fed it. Its paws were heavy and resting on my arms, and I fell in love. Lookie, a picture! (It's in my blog)This book, however, is not just about tigers. Tigers are only part of the equation, and trust me, this book is beyond the sum of its parts. Pi, contrary to what I originally thought as the tiger’s name, was actually the interesting nickname of an Indian boy who happened to be shipwrecked with a tiger and some other animals to begin with. It was a ridiculous and at the same time incredible situation. The book is separated into three parts, and the tell-tale tiger on several book covers does not get much exposure (literally and figuratively) until the second part. You would have to endure Pi’s musings on his name, religion, and zookeeping, among others. Thankfully, they weren’t too dragging for me so it was okay, but then I was also reading Les Miserables alongside it, whose meanderings are even longer than those of this book (but that is for another entry). Try to bear with it if you aren’t fond of draggy bits, because after that, things get more interesting.The whole reading experience could be likened to a sojourn into the ocean. A fun thing to do, theoretically, but no matter how much you prepare for it, you’re not really ready. You get used to it, and you calm down. Life goes on, but then you catch sight of land, and you try to go there, and you feel safe. A few feet from shore, however, a huge wave comes up from behind you and lashes down. Couple that with the vertigo of walking on a steady surface, and you get the unpredictable nature of this book. I mean, I was calmly reading it and feeling enlightened and pretty much basking in the glory of so much wisdom when suddenly, something happens and you see the book in a whole new light. Everything changes. Drastically. You are then left to choose what to believe. You can choose to read it like the atheists. Pi believed that “like [him], they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them – and then they leap.” Or you can read it like the agnostics, who will find the logical explanation and miss the better story. After all this, in the end, you will realize that Life of Pi’s not just about a journey with a tiger. It says as much about you as it does with Pi Patel, and possibly even more, if you think about it. It is a very unique experience, and more than you can possibly expect for less than 400 pages.The thing is, better story or not, you cannot deny each version’s individual beauty and wisdom, parallels though they may be. That is what I love about this book. On the one hand, you have a story that is fantastical and memorable, heartwarming and brought on by faith. On the other, you have a story rife with symbolism and the brutal honesty of reality. You don’t lose anything whether you believe in one story or the other. It’s a win-win situation.This is the first book I finished and my first 5-star rating for this year. I’m very excited to see the movie version. Before I do so, I have to say this: Read this book. Deciding whether to let go and believe, or listening to what makes actual sense, will probably prove to be a challenge (like it was for me), but it will be worth it. You will know how you see the world and you will understand why people need faith. And that, in itself, is a beautiful and rewarding experience.",7,0.9988,0.029,0.807,0.163,0.5277205150092473,POSITIVE,0.6093
227,20904730,04/24/2008,4.0," I heard what this was about and put off reading it because I didn't think I would like it. It's one of those books that you just keep pondering. I'm still not sure what it was all about! But it turned out to be a great book. I listened to it on tape and the narrator did an excellent job. His innocent voice and observational style provide a great contrast to the multi-layered, truth-filled story as it unfolds. Many things took me by surprise. I used my “willing suspension of disbelief” just to see where things were going and waited eagerly for the end to see how he would wrap it all up. I admit that the middle part of the plot got a little lengthy at points. I was tired of the castaway situation, but his beautiful descriptions and observations kept me interested. My favorite thing about the book was the way he played with the idea of what is real. I really enjoyed the dialogue between Pi and the Japanese representatives from the shipping company. They were so concerned with what “really happened” and Pi was so good at showing them that we can’t really be sure of anything. Just like Loving What Is. There was one line in particular, something about how with any “real thing,” we bring ourselves and our experiences to it and that changes it. It reminded me of quantum physics and What the Bleep Do We Know? Our influence on reality. Always multiple choices, multiple possibilities. I really liked the main character, Pi, and his collection of religions. He is the kind of person you would want to be stranded on a lifeboat with, resourceful, thoughtful, well-read. Richard Parker is another story . . . . Amazon.comYann Martel's imaginative and unforgettable Life of Pi is a magical reading experience, an endless blue expanse of storytelling about adventure, survival, and ultimately, faith. The precocious son of a zookeeper, 16-year-old Pi Patel is raised in Pondicherry, India, where he tries on various faiths for size, attracting ""religions the way a dog attracts fleas."" Planning a move to Canada, his father packs up the family and their menagerie and they hitch a ride on an enormous freighter. After a harrowing shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean, trapped on a 26-foot lifeboat with a wounded zebra, a spotted hyena, a seasick orangutan, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker (""His head was the size and color of the lifebuoy, with teeth""). It sounds like a colorful setup, but these wild beasts don't burst into song as if co-starring in an anthropomorphized Disney feature. After much gore and infighting, Pi and Richard Parker remain the boat's sole passengers, drifting for 227 days through shark-infested waters while fighting hunger, the elements, and an overactive imagination. In rich, hallucinatory passages, Pi recounts the harrowing journey as the days blur together, elegantly cataloging the endless passage of time and his struggles to survive: ""It is pointless to say that this or that night was the worst of my life. I have so many bad nights to choose from that I've made none the champion."" An award winner in Canada (and winner of the 2002 Man Booker Prize), Life of Pi, Yann Martel's second novel, should prove to be a breakout book in the U.S. At one point in his journey, Pi recounts, ""My greatest wish--other than salvation--was to have a book. A long book with a never-ending story. One that I could read again and again, with new eyes and fresh understanding each time."" It's safe to say that the fabulous, fablelike Life of Pi is such a book. --Brad Thomas Parsons --This text refers to the Paperback edition. ",7,0.9979,0.053,0.779,0.168,0.588871167818536,POSITIVE,1.0

PI!! delicious. because it's lunch time while i'm writing this, and for the sake of keeping my attention, we will hitherto spell it... pie. so... pie, and tigers (and some sashimi). logically, i should have been into this book. i love stories about survival. i love stories about zookeepers. i don't mind endless tirades on religion and enlightenment and tales of self discovery... too much. but i do love boat crashes and sharks and tinned biscuit rations. i definitely do NOT like mythical islands awash in acid that are inhabited by thousands of tiny gophers. not cool.halfway through this book, i was clearly reading for the sole purpose of finding out what happens to our main characters. tiger and pie alike. i wasn't that much interested in hearing about pie discuss philosophy. so i was kinda pissed when the story became less of a story and more of a ""the author just decided he's not really sure how to end this, so he's just going to take the whole 'i woke up and was dreaming' scenario a step further and make it 'pie woke up in a hospital and was hallucinating'"". wow that was a long sentence. almost as long as it took to wrap the book up once pi wakes up in the hospital. i gotta be honest. i just stopped reading. i almost NEVER do that, so this should attest to my eventual disgust with the author. and i don't really care if you judge me. i wanted a book about a kid named pie on a boat with a tiger. and i didn't really have the patience to deal with it all being a parable to address the meaning of life. sometimes you just know what you want. i wanted a giant cat to eat other things that were giant. like maybe a shark. or at least have the author make pie and the tiger bond so that eventually pie can ride it while they swim around the boat. ...ok ok, THAT was immature. maybe i'll just have to reread this book when i turn 7.(but seriously, your five year old self was kinda wondering whether they'd become magical friends and pie would ride the tiger, too)",7,0.9971,0.073,0.762,0.165,0.5436911487758945,POSITIVE,0.6892
230,294310146,03/14/2012,2.0,"In my review of 
The Virgin Suicides
, I mentioned that I considered it to be a 'classic' even though it was only published in 1993, so I guess I am pushing the boundaries even more now because Life of Pi was published in 2001. However, I am not alone in considering it to be a 'classic' – 432 people so far on Goodreads have tagged it as such. And like The Virgin Suicides, it's one of those books that everybody has heard of, and not just because of the film adaptation. I chose Life of Pi to be my second classic of the year (I know, I know – I'm behind!) to coincide with the film, which I really need to see because it looks beautifully made, and because it was one of those books that I had always be meaning to read, but just never got round to it. I had seen it being referred to as 'fantasy' and conjured up in my mind a picture of a very happy, light-hearted story. I was incorrect. Again.Life of Pi surprised me. It's both incredibly witty and incredibly harrowing. I read a lot of dark novels, in a way, from murder mystery to bleak dystopic societies, teenagers with cancer to post-apocalyptic wastelands, but it is rare that wit is incorporated. And you know what? It makes for an enjoyable combination and was my favourite aspect of the novel, along with the beautiful writing. It's described as 'masterful and utterly original' and I have to agree; it is like nothing I have read before. Simply, it's a fascinating tale about an attempt to survive on a lone lifeboat in the Pacific – the strength it takes to carry on, persevering through the boredom, unquenchable thirst, the sheer terror of being trapped with a dangerous animal, constantly afraid of making the wrong move, which may result in your sudden death. It was uncomfortable to read at times (especially as I am fond of turtles). In a novel where not a lot 'happens', everything is heightened. I both could and couldn't possibly imagine Pi's desperate, lugubrious situation.And yet it is not one of my favourite novels. I wasn't swayed, for the lack of a better word, by the discussions of God and religion and faith. It simply does not interest me (I read 
The Shack
 because of the mystery plot...) and it does take up quite a bit of the novel, especially at the beginning. Because of this, I find it difficult to look at Life of Pi as more than the sum of its parts. There is plenty I enjoyed telling other people about: survival (I feel I have learned a lot), Richard Parker, Pi's childhood, but it isn't enough to make it wholly memorable for me. Yet I appreciated the unexpected and underlying humour, from the set up of the story describing Pi's life in a zoo and how his father warned him about tigers, to Pi's blunt humour under the most extreme circumstances – and his ability to make fun of himself. I couldn't help but find him an endearing character, quite a feat when he's really the only character.Life of Pi is known for its iconic cover, depicting a boy, a boat, and a tiger, but there is a lot more to get out of it. It's well worth the read, if only to see what everyone else is talking about!I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books.",7,0.9838,0.102,0.747,0.151,0.6768796992481204,POSITIVE,1.0

In addition to being connected to animals, Pi feels a strong connection to God. He seeks out different religions in the hope of learning new ways of prayer and worship of God. When his parents decide to leave India behind and move to Canada, selling the zoo and their animals to start fresh, Pi feels he is being taken from everything he's ever known.But a wicked storm sinks the ship transporting the animals and family. Pi is the only survivior, on a lifeboat with a hyena and a zebra with a broken leg. Soon, an orangutan joins the group and Pi discovers that Richard Parker, a 450 pound Bengal tiger, was also on the lifeboat all along.The animals eventually kill each other off, save for Richard Parker and Pi. And so begins Pi's 227 days of survival and suffering in solitude in the middle of the Pacific ocean with only a tiger for company. Life of Pi is a difficult story to examine. The first part is written much like a philosophy textbook instead of a 16 year old narrative. No surprise; the author studied philosophy at university. If you asked most people who've read it ""What is is about?"", you would find that many would say it is ""A powerful and emotional story of survival and discovery.""In some rare cases while reading, this statement is true. But, in essence, I found this story to be remarkably silly and not very good overall. Pi's character, for one...you don't know what to make of him.His venturing out in the middle of a storm on the ship, ridiculously calling out; ""Canada, here I come!"" was bold and amusing at best; reckless and idiotic at worst. In most of his dialogue, I found him to be half mad. And I'm not even talking about when he was on the lifeboat; that would drive anyone insane. But when he was on the ship and even before that, he came across very strange, and not in a positive way. His determined will to survive and smart moves on the lifeboat were impressive, but the fact that he was doing it for 'Love of the Lord' instead of himself threw me off.(including a non-too-subtle insult aimed especially at agnostics; ""I'll be honest about it. It is not atheists who get stuck in my craw, but agnostics. Doubt is useful for a while....But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.""As an agnostic, this is the exact opposite of what we represent. We are open-minded, open to other people's views and believing that there could be a higher being or a heaven that we go to when we die or maybe we'll just rot in the ground. Who knows? To an agnostic, we are simply accepting to everyone's religions even if we don't completely agree with them. To describe that belief as 'doubt' is a direct condescension of agnostics and therefore pisses me off and shouldn't go so lightly.)Richard Parker was definitely the best and most fascinating character. The way he acted and behaved was actually quite realistic to the way a real tiger would act. However, the rest of the book fell flat in the 'amazing' and 'heartfelt' factor that so many people characterized it as. At times it was enjoyable but at most, it was tedious and monotonous. The writing felt bland and unemotional. The religion and frequent mentions of Godthroughout the storyline turned me away from what could have been a better story if executed differently.

232,465978053,11/28/2012,4.0,"Pi Patel is a young man living with his parents in India, caring for their zoo. When he turns 16, his father decides to sell the zoo and the animals and move the family to Canada. They book a ride on a ship, but things go wrong when the ship goes down. Now Pi must survive on a lifeboat with a tiger, the animal his father taught him to fear the most.A good friend of mine gave me the audiobook. Several of my friends have told me this is a great book, a must read. I don't know WHY it took me so long to read ""Life of Pi"", but I finally rectified that problem. And my friends are right: this is a really good read!Probably one of my favorite points about this book is the character and voice of Pi Patel himself. Since, in many ways, this is very much a character novel, Pi is a very important part of the book. And I thought Martel wrote him beautifully. I liked reading about a Person of Color, instead of yet another American boy. I liked his Point of View: he was smart, intelligent, clever, not rude, arrogant, or obnoxious. He respected his parents; he respected other adults; he was worried about more than that girl's tail to chase. And Pi was resourceful. He never gave up, kept trying to survive, relied on faith and his wits to keep going.Technically, there aren't a whole lot of other characters. Pi's parents appear only in the first half; the tiger, I suppose, could be considered a character, but his actions were more to push Pi than to reveal something about himself. There is a second POV that seems to be about an interviewer, but again, the focus is (appropriately) on Pi, not the interviewer. But although there aren't many other characters, I thought they were well-done. The parents were PEOPLE, not stupid idiots, blissfully ignorant of their son (though Pi did throw them for a loop occasionally). Pi's teachers and classmates were PEOPLE. They were realistic and helped lend credibility to Pi's story.So what is Pi's story? I think that is one of the most intriguing things of the book. Pi is shipwrecked on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific ocean with a live tiger. His life on the boat is a series of trials - from finding water to rationing supplies to catching fish to keeping his spirits up enough to WANT to survive. There is another aspect of the story, one you learn at the very end, which gives an interesting twist to the story. (view spoiler)[Which story is true? Did Pi struggle on the lifeboat with the tiger...or were the animals stand-ins for his mother, a young sailor, and the cook? (hide spoiler)] I wasn't too surprised, as I had heard things about this book and kind expected it (it also reminded me of a few movies I've seen - what do you believe, a person's experience or what you see with your own eyes?). But that doesn't mean the twist was bad.Probably about the only thing that I didn't like was the amount of exposition into the animals of the zoo, the running of the zoo, some of the religious meanderings, and how long Pi's stay on the ocean was.

233,9798828,12/01/2007,3.0," Life of Pi is a novel written by Canadian author Yann Martel. The protagonist in the story is Piscine Patel, also known as Pi. He is a young Indian boy living in Pondicherry, India with his family that is the owner of a zoo. The story begins with Pi exploring all the different religions including Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. Suddenly his family decides to leave Pondicherry to escape political issues. Taking most of their zoo animals, they board a huge ship heading for Canada. En route, the Chinese ship mysteriously sinks leaving Pi as the only survivor. Pi manages to get onto a life boat with a zebra, hyena, and orangutan. It is not until later that he realizes they are also accompanied by an enormous 450-pound Bengal Tiger.  In this book, I found the element of surprise very interesting. The book was very unpredictable and right when you thought one thing was going to happen, it would go the complete opposite way. I also liked all of the characters. Even though Pi was the only human, the author made all the animals seem human like too. The ending of the book was also very interesting. The author still had you thinking even after you had finished the novel.  The beginning of the novel was very slow and sort of boring. There was absolutely no action until about a third of the way through the book. He started off talking a lot about religion which some children do not find the most exciting thing. You sort of get anxious and keep wondering when the book is actually really going to start. Once the novel picks up, there are still parts that sort of drag on for a while but then it gets exciting again. The novel was also very spiritual and some parts were even very gruesome and disgusting. A young, immature audience would definitely not be able to handle this book at all.  The novel ended up being worse than I expected. I was disappointed with the lack of action and excitement. There seemed to be more boring parts than exciting parts. However when there were exciting parts, they were very good. A reader that was into religion and spiritual things would enjoy this book. A young teenager that likes a lot of thrill and excitement would not really like this book. Overall I would give this novel a seven out of ten, ten being the highest. I thought it was good, but not great. ",7,0.9928,0.068,0.759,0.173,0.4933002645502646,NEGATIVE,0.9993
234,421035419,09/24/2012,5.0,"A week after finishing Life of Pi I'm still a bit at a loss for words to review it as it deserves---I mean, THIS BOOK. I never thought it was going to blow my mind as it did and when that happens it's always extremely difficult for me to put into words exactly what the book in question did to me. The whole story is one incredible journey, not only because of Pi's castaway condition, but also because I learned so much about other cultures, religions, and mostly about animals and animal behavior---all this in a way that no class could ever dream to teach me. Although I won't be able to fully express my admiration for what goes on in Life of Pi, I have to point out my two favorite things about it, and they were, 1. the stunning, perfect, flawless writing---seriously, even the long list of items on the survival kit and various other provisions had its appeal; and 2. the author's sharp, genius, made-me-laugh-out-loud-several-times sense of humor---I want to befriend this person and have four, five, six hours long chats with him.I'm not going to lie though, there were a couple of moments that almost made me stop reading, I honestly did not see those horrifying scenes coming, but I'm glad that I managed to keep on reading and find out how, when, where Pi's journey was going to end. That said, the last fifty pages or so made such a mess out of my brain that I'm still trying to put it back together properly.Without a doubt, one of the best books of the year for me, which means I RECOMMEND IT, even if I understand this is one of those books one either loves or hates with a passion.(Copy provided by the publisher, via NetGalley.

He had to choose to either give up and be eaten by the tiger or to fight for his dear life. He chose life.""Some of us give up on life with only a resigned sigh. Others fight a little, then lose hope. Still others-and I am one of those-never give up. We fight and fight and fight. We fight no matter the cost of battle, the losses we take, the improbability of success. We fight to the end. It's not a question of courage. It's something constitutional, an inability to let go. It may be nothing more than life-hungry stupidity""-Pi Patel, Pg 148""I will beat the odds, as great as they are, I have survived so far,miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine. The amazing will be seen in every day. I will put in all hard work necessary. Yes, so long as God is with me, I will not die, Amen""- Pi Patel. Pg 148With that determination to live, he survived 227 days. In fact, he grew to love the tiger and was heartbroken by its unceremonial exit-so was I.

I mean, what was all that about?In the beginning, the old man said that this was going to be a story that will make me, or whoever reads about it believe in God.

So this story didn't make me believe in God, like the protagonist Pi Patel tells 'The Writer'.But when I consider this book as a work of literature, I'm lost for words. This book is essentially a fantasy novel, but there are so many other elements in this novel. There's science fiction. There is magical realism. There's fable & there's allegory. There is spiritualism & there is religion too - two concepts between which there's a thin line that separates one from the other. When all these elements are combined together - you either get an incredible mess of philosophical shit that would be hardly understood by anyone, or you get an extraordinary tale of adventure, survival & courage in the face of adversity. And the latter is what Yann Martel's Booker Prize-winning novel 'Life of Pi' exactly is.It doesn't matter whether you've watched the movie which released last year. It's not very dissimilar, but I still reckon you read this book just because it's such a fantastic story on so many levels.It's been sometime that I've been so overwhelmed after reading a book that tears welled up in my eyes.

A hundred pages later, our hero Pi is on a boat with a tiger, drifting in the currents of the Pacific ocean, with nary another human embarkation in sight. The premise seems scarcely believable, and indeed it does require a leap of faith, of sorts. But readers are always more than prepared to offer these leaps of faith, so the premise laid, the ramifications ensue. And what ramifications they are! Traveling on a boat with a tiger is a dangerous proposition, but Pi sees no way to get rid of him, and he becomes predictably attached to the beast, having known him from his early years in the Pondicherry zoo that his father owned.Pi's character is overly religious: he cumulates religious practices like most adolescents collect sporting activities. He is a Hindu, then a Christian, then a Muslim. All these approaches to God hold no contradiction for him, and together with his childhood in a zoo they form the skeleton of his character: respectful of nature and searching for God in all his manifestations.The story is artfully layered, and many details that appear to have been put in for descriptive purposes actually serve to inform subsequent events in the story.",7,0.9037,0.049,0.845,0.106,0.3705882352941176,POSITIVE,0.9993

I suppose some readers find the survival story riveting, but frankly it is a piece of fiction, so I was not impressed - the author is free to make up anything he wants!

If you want to know what turtle blood (straight up, no ice, no glass, just straight out of the turtle) tastes like, then this book provides a comprehensive description. Perhaps this is because Hollywood sanitises stories so they’re a better fit for general consumption.The second half of the book is surprisingly heavy on details about entrails. It’s right at home in the ‘Bear Grylls drink your own urine to survive’ category of castaway stories, even taking the theme as far as having Pi eat tiger poo.The presence of Richard Parker the tiger is a nice twist on this theme. He has an excellent back story involving an administrative error. Who doesn’t love an admin error with a funny outcome? However, as we reach the closing chapters, we discover this is not what the story is ultimately about, as in Pi sharing a boat with a tiger and eating entrails.For the most part, the writing is luscious, sometimes overcooked, often raw. It’s a tale of two halves. Part one tells the slow, philosophical story about Pi coming to terms with religion. Part two focuses on eating raw things. There is a short third part, but it’s more of an addendum to part two. Plus you can’t suggest the possibility of three halves without annoying mathematicians.My lasting impression is to sit on the gunwale over whether I liked it or not. I’m not a fan of books told in retrospect. It rips the heart out of the tension. We know there is no threat of Richard Parker ripping Pi’s heart out. Pi even tells us ‘he survives’ at one point, so we needn’t be worried about his fate. So, the reader asks: if you’re telling me what happens at the end, Mr Author, why should I read the account of this ordeal at sea if I know the protagonist survives? What then is the point of the story?I found myself dwelling on the closing chapters where Pi is relating the story to the Japanese shipping assessors. Here, he says:“I know what you want. You want a story that won’t surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won’t make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.”Are Japanese shipping assessors a particularly literal bunch? Do they have high blood pressure and don’t like surprises? Or is this a statement to the reader that the book isn’t about drinking blood and eating entrails, that it has a deeper meaning? Do not be afraid, potential reader. It’s not hard to find. And regardless of the religious context, there is a very agreeable message here about our frail human existence. Personally, I think this message would have had more impact, more emotional gravitas, more resonance had Pi’s fate remained uncertain.I’ll end here. I need to run a sink of water to see if bananas float.",6,0.9714,0.044,0.843,0.113,0.4973091575091575,NEGATIVE,0.9988
256,305956160,04/03/2012,1.0,"There will be some spoilers below as I explain my thoughts:Life of Pi has left me really shaken, and not in the way I imagine it shakes most people. The biggest thing that worries me about this book is that it is so well written it won a prize. Yann Martel is an extraordinary writer, and his story is extremely compelling.So why didn't I like this book, one might ask? Well, the answer is that this is a book that sincerely thinks it is doing a good turn, but I, and it looks like quite a few others, disagree, and that gives me hope and some relief.Life of Pi intrigued me since it's release, and I wanted to read it but never got around to it. The story of a boy being stranded at sea with a tiger was such a wonderfully compelling image that evoked such poetry in the tribulation of such an existence, that I was thrilled that someone was working in such a sublimely simple allegorical format, and the critical praise seemed to all push how moving and poetic this story was. Sounded right up my alley.The first problem came with reading through part 1 of the book and realizing this book seemingly had more theme than story, which to me (a fan of minimalism styles) is fine for a short story (see Amy Hempel's works for example) but just can't sustain a book over 300 pages. Chuck Palahniuk's ""Snuff"" was a novella and it suffered from the exact same issue on the writing side: there was too little going on to justify the information I was receiving. But, like I do, I gave the author the benefit of the doubt, as part one is only the first 100 pages, and I took it that apparently there was a LOT of set up that needed to be done or else he wouldn't be going so thoroughly into everything. But as part 1 progressed I found the story of Pi's life seemed to come back into play when talking about the religions. There were many moments I laughed at and many more I read out loud to my friends. One such moment that I thought was such a wonderful observation, was chapter 22 (which I would only realize halfway through the book was the damning force of the story tied up in a neat little bow). Chapter 22 offers a look at life from the views of different religious beliefs on the death bed, and says how agnostics will try to explain the whiteness of death as just lack of oxygen in the brain, and with no belief in an afterlife, they will ""miss the better story."" I thought that was such a fun, altruistic look at religion. And I still think it is, however, I do not think so on the same level that Life of Pi presents this idea at.Because that then, it slowly dawned on me, was the whole point of the book. The beautiful story of the tiger and the boy surviving together is not there to be an allegory at all, because it simply did not happen.Let me explain, the last part of the book is written as such: a transcript from two Japanese men who represent the company that owns the ship that sank and drowned Pi's family and put him afloat for almost a year. They ask him what happens and Pi explains his story (e.g. the rest of the book), and the two men tell him they do not believe. Pi insists that his story is true and can provide some very fragmented evidence, but evidence none-the-less, though of what, we're not completely sure. The men then insist that they want to hear the REAL story, a story without animals. Pi says ""ah, you want a story without animals,"" and then takes a moment to think before proceeding.This is where everything the author wanted to do breaks apart. I expected, having figured out the ultimate ideas of this book, that the point was ""which is the better story,"" like the ideas of chapter 22: when it comes down to it, do you want the boring information, or do you want an adventure?But Pi does not offer up boring information. And because of that, the offering of believing in god and a religion because it's more interesting becomes moot. The story Pi tells here is MORE interesting than that of the tiger. This is the story of how instead of wild animals on his boat, he was stranded with people those animals represented. And what follows is a cold, hollow tale of how the ship cook had survived on HIS ship, and killed one of the other survivors and dried his meat out and ate him and then murdered his mother before him and drank her blood, and then how Pi killed the man after he gave up on life and stabbed him over and over and over again... Now, he asks the men after telling both stories which they prefer and they say ""The one with animals"" and he replies, ""So it is with God.""SKRREEEE! Slam on the breaks here.The Life of Pi simply no longer functions as a book and this is why: the main theme of the book is that religion is the better story. But so is not the case here, and this is why: without the story of the insane cook cannibal, who murders his mother, Pi would not have been traumatized into inventing a new story. And because of that, the theme of replacing ""boring cold hard fact"" with ""fancy"" becomes not about where beauty lies (especially since both versions contain graphic violence) but what a person can deal with. The story that Pi creates is the escapist version of not having to deal with the horrors he had to see and perform at see. And because of this sudden push to trauma, I simply cannot accept the idea of the story of the tiger being the ""better story"" ""as with God.""The thing that left me so unnerved about this book is how so many people find the ending to be a beautiful representation of why we should disguise the pains and darkness we see by distorting it to make it easier. And this book is using the idea of religion to represent that. Now, I am a person who is agnostic, and I rather find the idea of any God silly (just, personally). But I appreciate the mythos of religion and find the stories in them gorgeous. So, to hear the idea that some of the most defining cultural movements of the world were developed as coping mechanisms creeped me out, as well as insulted me.I have to give this book 1 star because I cannot agree with what the author is trying to say. I think that he was on the right track until he pushed himself too far in trying to make his point, and instead overshot himself. Or maybe that's really where he's at and thinks that it's a healthy point to show other people: can't deal?

257,2332475042,03/23/2018,5.0,"Intelligent and bizzare, Yann Martel's Life of Pi tells the story of a sixteen year old boy who survives 227 days on a life boat in the Pacific Ocean, with a 450 pound Bangal Tiger named Richard Parker.Whilst reading this relatively short book, it appears to be no more than a story of survival and faith, however as the story progresses the real intent begins to blur the lines of reality. The open ended interpretation is what makes this book such a masterpeace. To some it is about how life and religion are but a story, and everyone will choose differently in what they believe and find meaning to. To others it is about the enlightenment and protection of God, but how religion can also consume you if you let it. But then it can also be interpreted as much darker, about the primitive side we all have, that only comes out when our lives are in danger, and it is too animalistic to bear. This book is written so openly, that the reader interprets it differently and chooses what they want to believe, just like in life.

262,424703573,09/29/2012,5.0,"Imagine a small towel, soaking wet, heavy and limp. The white cloth glistens, a dazzling illusion of smooth texture. In the two upper corners, one pinches the towel between thumb and index finger watching small drops like small chameleons plummet to the floor while liquid strings dangle from the bottom corners. Then one decides to alter the towel's state by carefully rolling it up along the top hem in order to twist it once it has reached its rod-like shape. The water pours down as if from an open valve. The water has not changed, though the towel has. The life-sustaining nectar has maintained its essence but has been freed from the confines of the less desirable story. Now, from the better story, one can drink the water and feel alive.Yann Martel has woven together a story of legendary proportions, philosophical entreaties and religious heroism. Life of Pi holds a life's worth of contemplation packaged in a perfectly simple articulation. Ah, the wonder of fiction - to convey such essential propositions with unmatched efficiency and purity.I will leave the reader to determine whatever overarching lesson they wish to find in this work. I only want to explore the ways in which Martel chooses to propose how we find it. First of all, the story comes to us from the mind of a listener, not from the one who experienced the adventure. Of course, we read the story in the first-person narrative form, but the listener dictates the story. Considering the religious diatribes and experiences of Pi, I can only wonder how Martel's decision on how to construct his narrative roots itself in the presentation of the Gospel stories, or other types of religion scripture. If Life of Pi resembles scripture, then perhaps it proposes how we might understand religious texts. Then comes the adventure, which, not unlike Hemingway's Old Man and The Sea, pits a young boy against the unyielding and merciless power of nature. However, Pi's suffering does not only sprout from the presence and nourishment of nature's forces but from the absence of everything he once loved and everything which once comforted his body and mind. Pi's experience mimics that of the archetypal heroism found in the trials of many religious figures.Only, he has a 450-pound Bengal Tiger. Named Richard Parker.During Pi's suffering he finds a kind of meaning in his life. The constant threat of Death adds vivid sensations of sorrow and thrill, hope and fear. If his life never ended, like the mathematical premise of Pi's namesake, what sensations would be left to experience? Let the tiger maul me, so what? Let the sea swallow me, and? Let my body degenerate, I shrug my scorched flaking shoulders. If one individual life holds meaning through suffering and death, what of Love and Life - not immortal beings but immortal essence? Is Piscene Molitor Patel dictating the Life of Never-Ending Love? The Life of God?The Japanese representatives from the maritime company that chartered the Tsimtsim wanted a factual account of Pi's experience. Yet when Pi's experience meant so much more than factual occurrences, how should he articulate it? How can he ring the water from the drenched towel? Pi talks of his carnivorous companion, with the human name, when it could have been a symbol for himself - a dichotomous representation of his soul. If he doesn't tell his story with a tiger, how will others understand the essence of that split feeling, that personal experience? Whether Pi bases his story in fact is irrelevant if we want to know the All of his experience. The essential truth, the imperative communication, takes precedence over factual circumstance and scientific plausibility. By sacrificing the essential experience to sensible reality we lose ourselves, our Souls, and forget that Truth never wanted to fit into the only box we choose to trust. Tell me your imagined reality and I will hear God's Truth. I will drink the freed water rung from the fibrous towel. I will live through the better story.

263,2000944888,05/15/2017,3.0,"3 starsLife of Pi by Yann Martel was a very different book from what I usually read. It was very philosophical. It follows the life of Piscine Molitor Patel (Pi) since he was a child in his Indian Zoo to his life on the boat with tiger Richard Parker to his life on the island. The novel begins in the happy, peaceful zoo. Later on in the novel, though, when Pi's father says that they are moving to Canada, everything goes wrong. The ship, Tsimtum, sinks and the only survivors are Pi, an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a tiger. How does Pi survive?Overall, this novel was a good novel. I think that I would have enjoyed it more if I into this type of novel. It was very slow, but then again it covered most of Pi's life, so that is understandable. It was also very slow paced, but it suits the tone of the story. I'd recommend it to people who like slow paced books or have read Sophie's World.I must admit that this was not the best novel I have ever read. This is okay, but I expected more from such a popular novel. It was very slow. Fast paced novels with heart-wrenching action are more the thing that I like. Also, at the beginning of the novel, the first 120 pages-or-so are just his life at the zoo. He actually gets onto the lifeboat with the animals on page 140 (or so). This might not bother all readers, but it did me.Other than that, this novel was great! When I started reading it, my first thoughts were: ""Wow! This is beautiful writing. I have never read anything more beautiful in my life! (That was an exaggeration)."" My thoughts never wavered once throughout the whole novel. The novel was written so well, that I could feel the sun burning my flesh and the salt stinging my eyes as I tried to catch fish, but hadn't prevailed. It made me almost cry over a fish!
I covered the fish's head with the blanket and turned the hatchet around. Again my hand wavered in the air. The idea of beating a soft, living head with a hammer was simply too much.I put the hatchet down. I would break its neck, sight unseen, I decided. I wrapped the fish tightly in the blanket. With both hands I started bending it. The more I pressed, the more the fish struggled. I imagined what it would feel like if I were wrapped in a blanket and someone were trying to break my neck. I was appalled. I gave up a number of times. Yet I knew it had to be done, and the longer I waited, the longer the fish's suffering would go on. 
Pi's character development throughout the novel was also astounding. He went from being a harmless, vegetarian boy to a ruthless survivor in just a few months. Yann Martel writes his novel in a way that when you look back at the last twenty pages, you see no difference, but when you look back a hundred, you see a different person. Surprisingly so, Richard Parker also goes through character development, but it would be a spoiler to delve into that.To sum up, Life of Pi was a well written novel with a plot which could have been that much better if it was a bit faster.",6,0.9976,0.046,0.769,0.184,0.4991192032368503,POSITIVE,0.6236
264,37675350,11/13/2008,4.0,"I had some internal debates as to how to rate this book, but finally decided on a more positive one. After all, this book doesn’t teach religion, instead it teaches perspective, and I love books that make you think and choose for yourself rather than dictate you on what to think and believe in. Right at the beginning of the book, it is mentioned that the story “will make you believe in God.” Will it really, or will it not, will depend on how one will view the events as told, and again the choice is left to the reader.If one has to take Life of Pi as pure fiction, a mere storytelling only, one will find the plot very fascinating. Pi, or Piscine “Pissing” Molitor, is an Indian boy born at Pondicherry. His father is a zookeeper and most of Pi’s life is spent observing the different characteristics of different zoo animals. Born a Hindu, Pi eventually discovered Islam and Christianity and decided to practice these three religions altogether, to the chagrin and amusement of the people around him. Afterwards, his family decides to migrate to Canada so they sold their zoo and embarked on a ship journey, but the ship sank. Pi is left on a lifeboat together with several animals, including a large Bengal tiger, and what happens for the next months (years?) may be beyond belief, or not, depending on how you view it.One thing that I like about Life of Pi is the education about animals and animal behavior that I got. There were animals mentioned that I haven’t heard before, and some that I’ve heard but have never really known. For instance, I though that hyenas are birds but are more like canines, as I’ve learned. I have never heard of meerkats before and I got curious about them when I read this book. The techniques on how to train animals are also mentioned and which I found equally interesting.The story is told through the narration of Pi himself, and I must say that Pi is a funny man. I love reading about his musings and his thoughts while on the sea, how he survived his hunger and thirst, the cold, the sun, and the sharks. I love reading about his realizations and reflections on life and survival, and his struggles to decide whether to live or die. I cannot imagine being at sea for days, or months, or years. The sea is fascinating for me, in fact I love swimming, but its entire vastness also intimidates and overwhelms me. How much more if one is left at sea all alone except for a Bengal tiger?However, there is more to the book than Pi and Richard Parker, the tiger, drifting at sea together for days. The third part of the story is told rather concisely but directly, and there is where the impact of the entire book lies. To say more would be highly spoilery, but I will say that this book is full of deep insights on religion, faith, and belief (or unbelief) in God.Life of Pi is worth reading, if only for its story alone. But as I’ve said there is more to the story than its events. It is much better if one will think.

It begins slower than I would have liked, we are introduced to Pi’s childhood in what seems to be a rather lazy and unhurried fashion. Stick with it.

The slow information about Pi’s childhood will become apparent soon.Here’s some info I found after having read Life of Pi: (view spoiler)[Quoted from Wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_PiRichard ParkerA Bengal tigerMain article: Richard Parker (shipwrecked)Richard Parker is a tiger that is stranded on the lifeboat with Pi when the ship sinks. The tiger lives on the lifeboat with Pi and is kept alive with the food and water Pi delivers. Richard Parker develops a relationship with Pi that allows them to coexist in their struggle.In the novel, a hunter who captured a tiger was named Richard Parker. He intended to name the tiger Thirsty, because of the tiger's long time drinking when he was found. In confusion when it was time for Richard Parker to catch a train ride to find Thirsty a home, the woman at the ticket counter thought the tiger's name was Richard Parker, and the hunter's name was Thirsty, with his last name being ""None Given."" Pi and his father found the story so amusing, they kept the name for the tiger, who lived at the zoo.Martel named the tiger after a character from Edgar Allan Poe's nautical adventure novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838). He knew of men named Richard Parker, including two associated with tales of shipwreck and cannibalism by sailors. Such tales were not uncommon in the 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include the following: In December 1835, the ship Francis Spaight was wrecked in the north Atlantic. Survivors of the wreck were known to have practiced cannibalism in order to survive. In January 1846, a second ship named ""Francis Spaight"" sank, and took a man named Richard Parker down with it. In 1884, 46 years after Poe's novel was published, a shipwreck occurred with circumstances that were similar to those in his book. After the sinking of their yacht Mignonette on the way to Australia, Captain Tom Dudley and three sailors were stranded in a dinghy in the Pacific Ocean. They believed they had no choice but to eat one of the party to survive. The victim was a 17-year-old cabin boy named Richard Parker. A.W. Brian Simpson's book on the subject mentions the Francis Spaight and also refers to a boat called Tiger, on which a youth was cannibalized in 1766.Having read about these events, Yann Martel thought, ""So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something.""

267,581648239,04/05/2013,4.0,"I came to this book prior to ever having seen the recent film or really knowing the books plot other than it involved a Tiger and a lifeboat. I remember it winning the Booker prize over ten years ago, but never really paid it much attention, rather I now believe to my detriment. Anyway, it was on sale in Tesco (I hear you boo and hiss, but I buy books from anywhere to be honest, usually the cheapest place, sometimes out of a concern for smaller booksellers. Ok, Amazon) so I picked it up as my eldest son wanted to see the film which is next on the list.I became very envious as I journeyed through the pages and their story; I became envious that Yann Martel has an incredible ability to craft an amazing, captivating, moralistic, quite off-the-cuff tale about a shipwreck survivor and a Royal Bengal Tiger trapped together in a lifeboat deep in the midst of the Pacific and not only that, he also has a great talent to write an autobiography, which is what the first part of the book is. Part two is all about the survival, and if anyone wants to go and join a circus or even wants to work in a zoo, then this book would have to be first on the reading list, as it contains very important information regarding animal territory and how to keep predators in check and not become submissive. Interesting. I have to admit too, that I found Pi's religious faith in his adolescence really quite progressive, and that combined with quite sensitive musings on life throughout (until the final Part three) and so on, really kept me reading about his trials and his will to survive that I found inspiring on several levels. But is this a religious book, and why is Yann Martel making observations about an Indian boy and his spiritual inter-faith of three major faiths in India; Hindu, Christian and Muslim? Obviously, the protagonist believes in God, no matter his previous incarnation. Good book, I really found it captivating, inspiring, different, happy, sad and hopeful.

268,13712923,01/27/2008,4.0,"Okay. So there's a ton of stuff to chew on in this novel. I must admit, at the very first I was sucked into the fact that it was, indeed, a true story, but then I realized it wasn't and felt a little stupid. :)Depending on which story you choose to believe at the end, I think that the book can be interpreted in two ways.If you believe the story with the animals (and I did), then I believe that Martel's entire point here was that it is often difficult to beleive that there is a God...sometimes things don't make sense, or seem possible, but that's how God is. It does require an enormous amount of faith to believe in many of the things religions teach us. Without faith, we won't believe.If you believe the ""other"" story (and I refuse to), then perhaps you'll feel that Martel is saying that God is just a great story and it is more interesting to believe in Him, even though of course He couldn't possible exist.But he does make the point that you have to believe one or the other. You cannot live your life based on doubt (agnosticism), so either believe or don't....just don't say I don't know...If indeed he meant for the second story to be true, I couldn't handle that. I don't know why. It just ruins things for me...changes the entire meaning of it all. But, it certainly fits. Strange that he would spend the bulk of the novel talking about the ""one with the animals"" and only a few pages on this one.I suppose I'll have to delve into it again and really decide what I believe, but I do have to say it was a fun and interesting read and I'd recommend it. I had to think really hard to glean the allegory (and not entirely sure I did)and it does indeed make you question what is reality and what isn't.

290,543970389,02/23/2013,4.0,"2020 EDIT: Haven't read this one since university.So. 'Life of Pi'. Wow there is a lot of over-description and over-detailing of aspects, such as the main character's education - among every other thing which amounts to his whole life story; no little, irrelevant tidbit is left out - and animals and zoos and swimming pools and religion and the meaning of life and surviving, etc. But strangely enough, I think these subjects, regardless of how they're written into the story, can still interest certain people. The writing can be muddled and all over the place - some parts feel like the author is less telling a story and more textbooking and preaching - but there is a calmness and euphoric atmosphere imprinted in the book. It's boring...but not distressingly so. In my original review, I referred to reading 'Life of Pi' as akin to a religious experience, and I haven't changed my mind. I haven't grown to be too cynical. I wish to preserve a good, loving and open minded heart (we all need one). 'Life of Pi' can be life affirming to some people.It has such a brilliant concept. If only it weren't so easy to skim through. If only it were shorter. If only the writing were more engaging and less, well, nearly everything else: ranging from judgemental preaching, to LOADS of telling the reader what a character is feeling - like in unnatural, cringey dialogue in the most bizarre circumstances - as opposed to showing. ""Show, don't tell"" doesn't apply to 'Life of Pi'.It's easy to read 'Life of Pi' as being pretentious and daytime TV bestseller bait. The Times, Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, New York Times, Independent, Metro, Observer, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times Book Review, Oprah, Richard and Judy - these will eat it up like hollow candy, and then they will wait for the next fad to insincerely consume and forget about a few months later. I don't believe that 'Life of Pi' was written to be like that (despite the very first line being: 'My suffering left me sad and gloomy.' How did I not groan and throw the book away the first time I read that? I could have written a better line when I was thirteen!). The novel isn't without substance. It isn't without genuine feeling and hard work shown on every page. The theme about the parallels and kinship between the nature of man and the nature of beast is very clever. I believe Yann Martel did write from the heart, and the amount of research done is evident and absolutely staggering. The captivating power lurks.Still, with the enormous word count and page count (319, yet it feels longer), plus the over-descriptions and bloated self-indulgence, maybe Martel could have benefited from using some restraint. And an editor.Also I've now picked up on the fact that Pi, as a young child, had an uncle figure who stripped naked next to him (it's in the text) before putting on his trunks, every time he took Pi swimming. Alone. Our narrator is completely oblivious to anything... creepy about that. His parents had no objections as well. Yeah.It is a little sexist/backwards when referring (as ""fact"") to both female humans and female animals, too.'Life of Pi' comes recommended, even though I didn't enjoy it as much on a second read, years later, enthusiastically and wholeheartedly. At this time. In this day and age. It is a nice read... for someone on holiday. Or for someone who's young and therefore holds an abundance of patience and free time within them. But...positive atmosphere and messages aside, it is not really something I want or need right now.Final Score: 3.5/5Original Review:Alright Yann Martel, you got me. You got me good.'Life of Pi' is a story about faith, losing and gaining trust - with none of the pixie dust. It's one of those books that is so delightful and so out-there that it might just be true. I love it when an author can make me believe in things I'd never even thought much about before. Whatever religion the reader is associated with - whatever beliefs he or she holds dear to his or her heart - 'Life of Pi' is a treat for any heart.My aunt gave me this book. She wanted to know what I'd think of it, since she didn't finish it. I can understand why some people might be put off by the story - it's not so much the detailing of animal life, or the religious speeches (that don't come across as that preachy to me). No, it's the middle of the book. There is only so much you can write about when your setting is on a small lifeboat in the middle of the never-changing sea. I admit to having found the middle somewhat dragging and repetitive after a bit, but Martel's writing - and the atmosphere and intense imagery he creates - kept me reading. It was the beginning and end of 'Life of Pi' I loved the most. They tell of Pi's life before and after he got tragically stranded in the Pacific on a lifeboat, all alone with cargo animals; most dangerously, an adult Bengal tiger. What I found to be endearing about the middle part is that Pi (the adorable protagonist) is struggling to survive externally and internally with the unpredictable tiger. His faith is challenged, and his need for human survival changes his mood like the weather. It is instinct; like animals use all the time. For example, he is a vegetarian, but he must eat meat to prevent starvation. He ends up doing things he never would have done back in his old home in India. Man and beast meet and battle one another in more ways than one. I felt connected to Pi, and the suspense of his story and character is brilliant.As an added bonus, I love animals and swimming pools. The descriptions of zoo life and famous pools at the beginning of the book are beyond charming. They add relevant substance and shape Pi as a character - up until his extraordinary story about both faith and reasoning as being necessary for survival.I dare say that 'Life of Pi' will change the lives of some people, make them not only think about what they believe in, but tolerate others for believing in something different. Faith in any god and in humanity is the heart and driving force of this novel.After finishing 'Life of Pi' I was left in stunned silence - a good sign that I'd just read a great book. I felt whole: full of light and wonder. I was also surprised by how many times I laughed out loud at some passages. When I look back I discover the amount of symbolism and foreshadowing the author left throughout the story. So 'Life of Pi' continues to pleasantly surprise me. Yann Martel tells a great story, but he also makes the reader think along the journey - a mark of a good writer of experience.Wonderfully written, lovable, tragic yet uplifting, funny, and highly clever and imaginative, I recommend 'Life of Pi'. Like my aunt, you might not be able to get into it as easily as I did, but it is worth a try.Final Score: 4.5/5Edit: I saw the film on the plane on my holiday to Africa. I may have to watch it again properly as its own film and away from my book-biased opinion (and it's not great to watch films in noisy planes on small screens anyway), but I still thought it was good. It followed the book well, despite adding a few unnecessary elements (like the forgotten love interest - romance is not needed to make a story sell!). A sense of wonder and human struggle came across clearly on screen - the SFX did not take up or distract from the life of Pi; in fact it elevated the colour of the book's spiritual themes. Good job, Ang Lee.",5,0.9996,0.059,0.757,0.184,0.510366583770839,NEGATIVE,1.0
291,1774267445,06/17/2017,5.0,"Life of Pi is about a zookeeper's son, Pi, who sets off to his new life in Canada. Animals from the zoo are also aboard his ship to go to the United States. Unfortunately, the ship crashes, and Pi finds himself stuck in a lifeboat with a tiger. This is the story of his survival. This was such an intriguing read! The animal and zoo aspects of this story enticed me -- all the different facts about animals, habitats, and personalities. The way Pi ends up dealing with the tiger is fascinating to read about. The different ways he asserts his dominance and keeps the tiger fed and happy so it stays away from him is amazing and was very believable. The audiobook reader also really got into making the tiger noises, which was fun. Survival stories are always cool because the characters are abandoned and have to make do with so little. Pi didn't sugarcoat it--it was horrible and lonely and he ended up dehydrated and starving and eating tiger feces at one point--but he didn't totally lose hope, which is always the best part of survival stories. They manage to keep their personalities and wits and use them to keep themselves alive. The fact that he had a huge tiger there was both a blessing and a curse. He had company to keep him from going insane, but he also went a bit insane of fear that he'd be eaten.Once I read that the author studied philosophy, all the religion mentioned in the book started to make more sense to me. This book wasn't just a simple survival story. It was very religious and philosophical, which made it even more interesting in my opinion. Pi, this poor kid, just wanted to love God from all points of view, which baffles the rest of his family and priests. I think the promise of God also kept him alive in the lifeboat, which was touched on a bit but not to the point where you think the whole point of the book is just to convert you. The writing of this book was amazing and kept me on my toes. The only problem I had were the last 2-3 chapters with interviews, which I thought were absolutely pointless and ruined the story. I can also see, though, how it's important (thanks to the book club discussion questions in the back of my physical copy). It ended up making me question everything, which wasn't a satisfying ending.I would recommend this to everyone--especially fans of animals and survival stories (duh).

292,2248820513,01/19/2018,3.0,"35/5. This book started off strongly with captivating writing, entrancing and vivid descriptions of exotic animals and quirky human characters interspersed with acute observations and philosophical musings. I especially enjoyed Pi's enthusiastic embrace of religion, an abundance of religion, all 3 of them in fact - Catholicism, Hinduism and Islamism. I enjoyed the detailed, colourful descriptions of the Zoo animals. I enjoyed the amusing glimpses into his unconventional childhood, growing up in an intellectual, zoo-owning Indian household. Unfortunately the book then got bogged down by these tediously detailed descriptions and facts, an encyclopaedia of various sciences - chiefly zoology, but also geology, biology, meteorology, physics etc. I love science -just not as part of my light reading. This encyclopaedia was housed inside his head, a 16 year year old adolescent boy, quite smart I grant, but still incredulous. The philosophical musings became sparse and were mere 2 lines or so at the end of exhaustingly prolonged factual report. I wanted more. The dialogue towards the end lacked effortless charm, becoming too pretentious. There were absolutely horrific and gruesome scenes of violence and cannibalism. I am not dainty, but it was hard for me to listen through some of these, though I endured them all, each scene more savage than the other.I must say, the ending I did not expect. Extra points for that. It definitely made me wonder, what I have missed, but I don't think, I can sit through this book again to pick up on new nuances, I might have missed the first time and reinterpret it. I would consider watching the movie to see Ang Lee's take on this fantastical story, but I don't think I can't handle visual gore as well.",5,0.9437,0.082,0.772,0.146,0.6048656204906204,NEGATIVE,0.9981
293,423070608,09/27/2012,3.0,"Also on A Book With a View.ETA: About rating: These are probably the truest three stars I've ever given. More often than not, I give three stars to a very flawed novel I liked despite myself. In this case, I really just ""liked it"". It wasn't ""meh"", but it simply failed to stir me any further. Life of Pi is one of those books which read as whatever the reader wants them to be read as.Religion is often brought up when discussing Life of Pi. One might think it would not appeal to atheists. Agnostics, even more - main character pities them even more than atheists. Interestingly enough, it might not appeal to devoutly religious, either, for similar reasons.I was not sure what to define Pi's religious views as; I settled for kathenotheism, and it fit with my impression of Pi. Kathenotheism is related to Hinduism; Pi merely adds non-Hindu gods to his pantheon, to be praised as supreme when their turn comes. He was exposed to Hinduism first, so the notion of monodeism and historical and cultural significance it has for us are foreign to him. It's not as revolutionary or profound as it might sound.I'm not fond of being preached at, but I didn't feel it in this book. Maybe because I looked at Pi as a character, someone with his own way of thinking, his own virtues and flaws, rather than omniscient narrator that is supposed to impart words of wisdom to us. To me, his religion was simply a part of his character, not a subject to be judged as absolute right or wrong. How you will feel about it will depend on how you approach the book. But even those who feel annoyed by this facet of Pi might find satisfaction in the ending - one of the endings, that is.Theme that interested me much more than religion was nature. First, nature in the zoo - first time I heard good things said about the zookeeping, truth be told. Then, nature in the extreme conditions - survival on the boat with the danger within and without. Still, in both cases, we are presented with contrast of animal, primal, brutal, instinctive nature versus human, principled, civilised, controlled nature. However, as the time goes on and conditions become more extreme, we can see the expected degeneration of human into animal - but there is also a moment when animal becomes human. Third part toys with the limits even further - depending on which ending you go with. This exploration of nature is, appropriately, naturalistic. Which, while effective, might not be everyone's cup of tea. Brutality, gore and bodily waste might disturb those of delicate sensibilities.The ending(s) is what I loved about this book the most. It confirmed my first impression that this book is more open to interpretation than attempting to impose a single opinion. The point of the entire book is here. And keep in mind that whatever you hear about the ending from other people, it's their choice - what the ending will be for you will depend on yours. I cannot and I will not say any more, because the journey is as important as the goal here, and there is no point in discussing them separate from the rest of the narrative so far.Narrative, however, is what I found problematic at first. At first, I saw it as first-person-limited with stream-of-consciousness. But it's not entirely true, because there is a scene with Pi's parents where Pi is not present, and there is no way anyone but parents would know how the conversation went. It has a purpose, but I don't think it was necessary - it underlined rather than gave something new. I know the form is practically nonexistent these days, but it felt rather clumsy.Likewise, I didn't feel that the interruptions by the interviewer were necessary. Yes, they gave us more info about Pi, but none of it was really necessary to appreciate the story. Were they supposed to represent a journalist’s commentary? If so, why was a good chunk of Pi's story left uninterrupted? Surely the journalist would have some commentary on the survival drama. Didn't want to break the important part of the narrative? Don’t break any of it. ‘Interviewer's’ view of the Pi could have been put in the prologue and maybe the epilogue. Uneven distribution of the commentary was worse than its constant presence would have been. Yes, I realise this book was supposed to be divided in three parts; the part with the commentary being the first part, the one about Pi's childhood. But Pi was presumably telling this second part to the same person, connecting to the story about childhood. If the author was going for 'authentic' record, these two parts should have been consistent - in my opinion, at least.Still, shaky narrative techniques aside, the prose itself was very good. It was descriptive and rich without sounding like someone showing off what they learned in the creative writing class. Of course, combined with stream-of-consciousness, this creates a slow pace which I personally don't mind but I understand a number of readers consider problematic. Consider yourself warned.I’d recommend it to people who prefer literary to genre fiction, but those among them who like to take things at face value rather than examine author's motives. People who enjoyed The Old Man and the Sea might like it. People who enjoyed The Big Wave might like it. So might the people who liked The Red Tent. Fans of Paolo Coelho and Anthony de Mello. These suggestions are not so much about themes as the ""feel"" of the book. Because, really, impressions are what it is about, not facts.Is this review ambiguous? So is Life of Pi.

295,2198115616,09/16/2020,2.0,"This book was recommended to me as a beautiful and subtly symbolic survival story. Well, it is a survival story, and the writing, while undeniably over done at times, is decent overall. Is it subtle though? I would say it's the exact opposite. It is an ornate hammer, with the author's views on religion and spirituality beating you over the head throughout. The main character is an adherent to the whole, every religion is fundamentally true belief. They are all different paths to the same God. It is a bit Pi in the sky(I apologize greatly for this) but hardly the worst of religious beliefs. The problem I have with this book, is it pretends to take other viewpoints into account but never actually does so. They are all just shallow counterexamples meant to prove the author's own views to be true.The final maxim of the novel, basically that if it doesn't make any difference if there's a God, why not just include him, because the world is a more beautiful place with him, particularly irked me. To say that your own sense of beauty in the world is the only one, is borderline narcissism. The world doesn't need your belief for someone else to think it's beautiful.That aside, it really dragged at times. Whole sections of this book are completely forgettable or are doing the whole Walden thing, trying much to hard to see a deeper meaning in an individual's experiences.

297,383556903,08/03/2012,5.0,"Like the ocean THE LIFE OF PI is a story with many currents. At the surface is a simple story – the hero, Pi, ends up on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger. (No spoiler here. It's right on the cover art!). The story is a dialectic about survival and existence and the meaning of both. We are enticed into anticipating a fanciful tale wrapped in surreal overtones. Author Yann Martel, however, has deeper intentions in mind.To follow the path of surrealism would invite dismissal and this is the last thing Martel wants. Therefore, part one (“Toronto and Pondicherry”) is devoted exclusively to setting a foundation of reality. The author, a Canadian, recounts his quest for inspiration, which, due to his limited budget, brings him to India, specifically Pondicherry, where the cost of living is low, and the environs familiar due to a previous visit. Pondicherry, unlike the rest of the subcontinent, began as a French colony. The locale itself, is thus tagged as a sort of semi-exotic anomaly. There he chances upon an old man, Mr. Francis Adirubasamy. Learning that Martel is Canadian, the old man prefaces his story with the intriguing remark: “I have a story that will make you believe in God. It starts right here in Pondicherry just a few years back, and it ends, I am delighted to tell you, in the very country you come from” (p. x). Like us, the author is both wary and skeptical. But what an irresistible lure to our curiosity!The narrative commences in the voice of a memoir recited by Pi. We learn of his family, his friends, his inspired reinvention (from Piscene to Pi), of his studies at the University of Toronto where he majored in zoology and theology. It's the memoir or a curious reflective adolescent whose father owns the now defunct Pondicherry Zoo, and of his exploration of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. He grew up in the culture of Hinduism, but is drawn by the charismatically calm demeanor of two mentors, a priest and a baker. When his unique syncretism is confronted in a comical situation, the 16-year old Pi answers simply: “Bapu Ghandi said, 'All religions are true.' I just want to love God” (p.69). Before the skeptic can object, an older Pi has already elaborated: “...Atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith....Like me they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them – and then they leap” (p.28). His aversion is to agnostics. “To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation” (p.28). As a zoo keeper, Pi's father impresses upon his sons the error of anthropomorphizing the animals. He does this through an enactment not unlike the cow/Velociraptor scene in Jurassic Park. At the same time, Pi embarks on an extended consideration of how humans might be viewed through animal eyes. Our ties to hearth and home stem from the same source as their instinct for territoriality. Our understanding of social order is a variation of their alpha-omega template. The seed of this dialectic is subtly cultivated in Part II. We meet an unnamed zebra and hyena, but the organgutan and tiger are given names. At the same time, there is conformation to the detailed logic of animal behavior that Pi has laid out in Part I.Clearly, by the end of Part I Martel expects the reader to be invested in Pi. Who could resist the appealing combination of innocence and intelligence. Thus far, he has exercised extreme discipline, holding our interest without resorting to fake suspense or scary foreshadowed dangers. The beginning chapter of Part II (“The Pacific Ocean”) is therefore a surprising and energizing jolt. Martel jumps ahead in time to a moment of emotional extreme. The succeeding chapters revert to the established pattern of chronology leading up to that opening event. Martel has successfully energized our emotions while keeping them carefully channeled.Martel revives this emotional climaxing once again, when, all hope nearly exhausted, a lush island is spotted. Garden of Eden imagery mixes discordantly with that pop culture incantation “never get out of the boat.” The island performs several plot progressing services as well, but psychologically, it reminds us that even with a promised “happy ending” the author is fully capable of igniting our unease. That feeling is realized once again when Pi is interrogated by the comically ever-so-proper Japanese representatives of the sunken freighter. It's his way of invoking the reader's involvement, and ultimately, participation.Martel's writing is extraordinary. Similes and metaphors are never dropped randomly for show. For example, a dazed Pi relates: “At length, as slowly as a caravan of camels crossing a desert, some thoughts came together.” But he does not end here. “The day was like the previous one, warm and overcast, the clouds low, the breeze light. That was one thought. The boat was rocking gently, that was another.” Self-deprecating humor and incongruous observations add to our reading delight. Serious questions are posed with style. Questioning why all this is happening, Pi laments: “Why can't reason give greater answers? Why can we throw a question further than we can pull in an answer? Why such a vast net if there's so little fish to catch?” (p.98). This is a short book, but not a quick read. The writing is so good that one is tempted to examine individual passages painstakingly, to record their unique opalescence. Resist that temptation – this is one of those books that demand a second reading. Time enough then to explore the author's craft.",5,0.9961,0.054,0.826,0.12,0.5207257601835913,POSITIVE,0.7812
