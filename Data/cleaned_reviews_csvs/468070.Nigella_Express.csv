Nigella is a funny, smart writer with a killer vocabulary (plaudits? recherche?) as well as her own vocab (e.g. ""spatch"" as a verb meaning ""spoon with a spatula""), so much less annoying than you-know-who and her EVOO.

6,96542510,03/31/2010,5.0,"I was actually surprised that Nigella came out with this new cooking concept, making her favorites with short cuts, suddenly being impatient and saving time while still having parties and cooking dinners ever night for her family. Honestly I never found her recipes hard, I enjoyed making everything the proper way but I have to say its fun to find way to cheat I guess, making mousses without all the fancy work, creams and cakes and stews with minimal effort, without hours of baking and slow cooking, using less ingredients ( saves tons of money) and still eating something tasty.Basically this book is filled with recipes one can make for any occasion, best yet for dinner after a hectic day of work, using 4-5 ingredients, simple and still having something to put on the table that is not the same old saver we turn to. Too often it's easy to fall into a comfortable rut and cook the same thing; with this book it is really easy to gently shake things up. Sometimes I read it at work, photocopy pages, stop at the store on my way home and make something new that's different and doesn't require me to spend 2 hours cooking and then washing lots of pots and pans. I think to write this book requires more effort, it's easy to make a complex dish using thirty ingredients, but hard to make something simple that takes the least amounts of effort but is edible. I often pick one recipe, and then make a side of my choice even if it's steamed veggies and dinner is on the table in no time.I have been using this book since last November and some of the my favorites are;Mustard Pork Chops page 11- any meat can be used but pair it with white cannolini beans, simplicity ( 5 ingredients! ) at its highest, actually writing about it now made me decide to make it for dinner tonight, yet again.Steak Slick with Lemon and Thyme - great on some toasted ciabatta bread the next day or as an elegant supper, lemon and thyme seems to be a classic combination, not I make all my steaks this way.Cheese Fondue - Gruyere, Brie, Emmental and Camembert melt into a spectacular and easy dip for anything you can find in the fridge. Some white wine in the sauce and then in the glass to drink with completes this fun dinner.Chocolate Croissants - more fun then I thought to make, sometimes I just make four, with this book there is no need to make thirty servings of something, I often make enough for just one day.Moonblush tomatoes page 126- sour, tangy, roasted and great side to savory dishes, my new favorite. I find it goes great with eggs for breakfast!Irish Cream Tiramisu - wow, interesting and make sure to reserve a nap after, packs a punch!There are stir-fries, galettes, cakes, burgers, all sorts of meats and pastas, each page has a tiny recipe with a gorgeous picture, and this book is actually very useful and makes cooking fun especially to see how the short cuts turn out. I mean if the short list of ingredients doesn't make one want to cook out of it then the pictures will, and it's nice to have a cookbook that is always used versus having one recipe in it that I have to turn to. Nigella throws things together in a beautiful way, after reading and cooking her recipes to me they are as natural as breathing and they pretty much always turn out perfect! Now that is a feat, I haven't had to apologize for making something new to anyone and it's easy to see that her ingredient pairing choices are well through out and put together.",3,0.999,0.037,0.77,0.194,0.5247693774479488,POSITIVE,0.9925

Her recipes are usually full of flavour and are quick to prepare.Quick is what I like (in addition to the sensual part of cooking), so I picked up Nigella Express. Overall, the book meets it's title. Most of the recipes take less than a half hour to prepare. Her Crab and Avocado Salad with Japanese Dressing is refreshing and flavorful. She mixes Scallops and Chorizo for a quick, different and colorful meal. The Layered Salad with Roast Quail and the Buttermilk Roast Chicken are again very simple but full of flavour.

For example, the recipe for ""Maple Chicken and Ribs"" calls for ribs, but doesn't say whether or not to separate them before roasting.

Nigella Lawson offers relatively little in the way of an introduction to her recipes.

However, after a second run through, more items have caught my eye.I tried three recipes from the book, and the Red Shrimp and Mango Curry was the best of the bunch. The Brandied-Bacony Chicken had a fantastically crisp skin, but not a ton of taste in my opinion, and the potato and mushroom gratin was eaten without complaint although my kids deemed it 'nothing to write home about.'Overall, I think this is a solid cookbook for anyone looking to mix up their weeknight meals.",0,0.8549,0.0,0.911,0.089,0.2687499999999999,NEGATIVE,0.9956

202,1917584420,02/18/2017,4.0,"I'm not a recipe guy. I read cook books for images and commentary, trying to get a sense for what the writer thinks about cooking, while noting down ideas for future creations. There are two added pleasures in a Nigella Lawson cookbook for me. Firstly, she doesn't fuss about being correct and is unapologetic about being a traditionalist in many of the ways that matter (not necessarily in food!). Secondly, there are not-infrequent snaps of her in it, almost always with food (insert happy sigh here).The book is well divided, with recipes and ideas for many occasions and sentiments, from the very simple to the not complex. The clue is in the name ""express"" - these are not supposed to be difficult-to-execute dishes, but that doesn't make their flavor profiles thin.Some favorite quotables:""The thing is, whenever people, perhaps showing a slightly patronizing amusement at how often I cook (and maybe it's that which irks), claim that they themselves never have the time to cook, it makes me feel uncharacteristically aggressive. What I want to point out is that they are hardly using the time they save by not cooking writing War and Peace. I don't say that finding time to cook makes you a better person, but nor do I think that being ""too busy"" to cook means that your life has automatically higher purpose."" (p. 85)""...My mother could never resist finger bowls either, and there is something to be said for filling small dishes with warm water and a slice of lemon, and drop of rosewater too if you're exotically inclined, but on the whole people tend not to use them these days so your thoughtfulness may be wasted and you may be casting pearls before swine, if that's not too rude a way to talk about your friends."" (p. 193)""Instead of making a stuffing for the turkey, buy some good sausage meat from the butcher, and using your hands, wiggle some space between the skin and the breast of the bird and squeeze the sausage meat in there. In other words, you're stuffing the top of the bird (beneath the skin) rather than inside it...You can really blitz the bird, as the sausage meat stops the breast from drying out."" (p. 315)The photography in the book is a perfect complement to Nigella: unfussy, unhurried, and simple.",0,0.9917,0.026,0.84,0.134,0.4685920047031158,NEGATIVE,0.9996

I have been known to read cookbooks cover to cover for the pleasure they give. But this book, Nigella Express, is a stalwart standby for me in the kitchen. The recipes are no-fail, and they always impress my guests. I have made the instant chocolate mousse for company many times, and everyone always loves it. The recipes are uncomplicated, the ingredients pared down to their essentials, but still somehow, the finished dish tastes like more than the sum of its parts.
