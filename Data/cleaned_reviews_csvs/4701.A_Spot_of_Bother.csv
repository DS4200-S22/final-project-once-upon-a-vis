0,44055253,01/23/2009,4.0,"i don't know why people who've read the curious incident of the dog in the night-time would find this second novel a let-down. it seems to me equally tender, sweet, and heartbreaking. it's also hilariously funny. haddon does heartbreaking and funny with such grace, simplicity, and verbal virtuosity, it's wonderful. i admire this writer greatly. what i admire most about him is that he shows us the behavior of ""crazy"" people who do ""crazy"" things from the inside, and from the inside these crazy things make total sense. george's shenanigans are as meaningful and entirely understandable to us as christopher's shenanigans, and, just like in the first novel, we are quite surprised that people around these two should not be more compassionate and understanding, because both george and christopher seem lost in an earnest, brave, broken, and entirely adorable way.there's a lot here about class, and i imagine other non-english people might find it as hard to make sense of as i did. i mean, ray seems absolutely perfect from all possible points of view, as does tony, but the stuff of class gets in the way tremendously, and one is left quite perplexed until one remembers what one has learned about england from the movies, and it makes a little more sense.the little kid jacob is picture perfect. haddon has a thing with little kids (of all ages).another thing that haddon does really really well is show how people like george and christopher, i.e. people who either are different or become different at some point in their lives for some very painful reason, manage to break down barriers and distances in others that would otherwise be as immutable and untouchable as the rotation of the planets. and then everyone feels better. except there is hell to pay, for everyone, and this is the really heartbreaking part, the amount of pain haddon packs in his books. i was discussing this just now with someone and realized that the highest common denominator between dog and bother is terror. and i don't do terror very well. but this book eases you into terror gently, and by the time you realize that the book is killing you you are too caught up to stop reading it. anyway, i really liked this book. it doesn't dispel the terror, or maybe it doesn't do so entirely, but it might make you feel like you are not the only one to live in a constant state of terror, and that's a little soothing unto itself.

1,26419749,07/06/2008,1.0,"As we approach the end of my first year of recorded and reviewed reading, I have read almost no bad books. The Fermata was bad, but the guy could write, he just decided to write something we all thought was fucking awful.This was a bad book.Oh how do I hate this book? Let me count the ways:1) Every word in this novel is written in conversational, lazy prose. ""Absolutely"" is used repeatedly for emphasis. ""Cue"" something or other. The kind of verbal junk we are all guilty of in verbal conversation, but letting it form the bulk of your novel is unforgivable. I felt like I was reading a second-year English essay. Honest to god, I'm not exaggerating. Junk prose. Never a hint of an interesting sentence structure.2) This device, used repeatedly, I'm guessing to give the novel some appearance of depth. Let's call it the Family Guy Device. ""The day was turning out badly. Almost as badly as that barbecue with David Morris and Bettie Constance in Salford last summer, thought George."" STOP RANDOMLY FUCKING DROPPING NAMES I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE AND WON'T HEAR AGAIN. There's enough one-dimensional characters to keep track of without my having to check off new names against the list every two chapters. I can't tell you how many times this was used in the course of 500 pages.3) 500 PAGES? To tell this story? Are you kidding me?4) The relentless assault of pop-culture references. Lethal Weapon, The 6th Sense, The Lord of the Rings, BBC Radio 4. Wedding music is ""that Bach Double Violin piece from the compilation CD Dad gave her from Christmas last year."" And it's not just the pop-culture bits (Oscar Wao was full of Lord of the Rings stuff), it's that they are brought up again and again and again, but not one character betrays any interest that dips below to most shallow and obvious cultural stables. It felt like examples of tastes were deliberately chosen so that no reader would ever miss a reference. These people, is seems, are the most banal people you have ever met.5) 500 FUCKING PAGES?Picture a wet Sunday afternoon, and you are spending it at a slightly run-down shopping centre in the outskirts of town. You check out the record store, but whoever's stocked their shelved has decided to focus on boy-bands and Nickelback and club-anthem compilations. The book-shop is full of ugly, glossy cookbooks and footballer biographies. You glance into the clothes shops but the mannequins all look like the men you feel most uncomfortable around in the pub at weekends. You go to the cafeteria to kill some time, and sit under bright fluorescent lighting at grey plastic tables and eat a bun seemingly made out of another kind of plastic. The tea is tepid and has an oily film on its surface. And it's not the afternoon you're experiencing in this place, it's the people around you, when you realise that even if you asked them, they wouldn't see what's wrong with this. They wouldn't understand your problem.This novel was a 500 page trek through everything that tires and disappoints me most about the modern world, and I'm sorry if that illuminates some fault in me and not the novel, but that's the way I feel.",53,-0.9403,0.114,0.79,0.096,0.5771866391184574,NEGATIVE,1.0

4,1414775763,10/12/2015,4.0,"This is a really good, absorbing drama about a family in crisis and in particular tells the story of George who, at the age of 57, suddenly faces the fact that he is not going to live forever upon the discovery of a lesion on his hip. Wife Jean is sleeping with an old work colleague of his. Daughter Katie is preparing her wedding to Ray, a man who is universally disliked by her family and to be honest, she is not sure whether she is marrying him for the right reasons. Finally, son Jamie is facing a dilemma – he wants to bring his partner Tony to the wedding, but he fears his family are not ready for that.There is a thread of black humour running through the book but I did feel it was more moving and emotional than funny as George’s depression first crept up and then engulfed him. It all felt so real, as if it was happening to somebody I knew and these sections in particular were beautifully written. The whole family, in fact, felt frighteningly real to me, and I found myself nodding my head so many times throughout the book at things they said.They are all in crisis in one way or another, and as each short and sharp chapter is told through alternate viewpoints, I really got a good understanding about what was going through everyone’s thoughts. They are all brutally honest with themselves but the sadness is that none of them speak to each other about the things that matter.It was a book that really grabbed me and held my attention during the build up to the wedding but there were one or two things I wasn’t too sure about. George is 57 and I am in my early 50s so I could really understand his sudden fear when he realised that he is not immortal, but he didn’t “feel” like someone in his fifties. I never saw him, or Jean, as contemporaries as mine as they felt as if they were from a different generation. I did feel the ending was a little “too” upbeat, the cloud over George’s head just seemed to blow away a little too easily in relation to the pain he suffered throughout the book. I couldn’t help thinking “oh if only depression could be solved that easily in real life”. On the whole though, this is a good entertaining read that delivers some very real home truths with very realistic characters that I thoroughly enjoyed. Yes, there are those bits that I wasn’t sure about, but they were far outweighed by the good.",20,0.7674,0.124,0.741,0.135,0.5493604108309992,POSITIVE,0.9998
5,78160736,11/17/2009,5.0,"A Spot of Bother is an alternating-POV story about going quietly mad and loudly sane, and love under all our layers of repression and confusion: There’s newly-retired dad George, politely failing to bury his increasing obsessive thoughts of mortality under a zest for home renovations. Mom Jean, already balancing familial duty and work and volunteering, is just trying to find more time for her passionate affair with a long-time acquaintance. Their outspoken grown-up daughter Katie intends to marry her boyfriend Ray despite her suspicion that he’s wrong for her— because he’s right for her son. And emotionally-distant son Jamie just can’t explain to his boyfriend why he’s not invited to the wedding. Haddon’s style is pretty sparse, but earnest. The characters’ dramas could easily become trite, but their awareness and wryness in the face of their situations instead lends an endearing realness. At times I almost felt a little cheated that the split narratives, by necessity, truncated the fuller version of each story. But even with the glimpses, I got a sense that each Hall lived in a world beyond just the necessary set pieces, full of friends and coworkers and exes—of complex relationships—a specificity that allowed me to be drawn into their struggles in spite of myself. The strongest parts of the novel are actually when the family members directly interact. We get to “see” the same events in their overlapping voices, which surprised me by highlighting the complexities of intention and communication (rather than falling into tedious exercise). If you’ve ever seen one of these comedies, it’s hardly a surprise that all these threads erupt into a madcap ending. I think some readers might find George’s central story kind of crass and shocking and inexplicable at times. I sort of wished Haddon was less enigmatic about it, especially being the subject that was probably the hardest to comprehend or relate to. But real life is not tied up so easily. And so when all the dust settled, I found myself left with some heartwarming end scenes and some open end scenes… but most of all, the overall sense of empathy for the ways people try to make sense out of the chaos.(Reread April 2012: Nothing to add of insight, except to note poor Mark Haddon, doomed to forever have his work as ""not as good as his first novel Curious Incident. Well those people are wrong. A Spot of Bothers's comedy of manners is just as accessible, and it shows more maturity regarding character development and less reliance on the so-called cute gimmicks he's been accused of propogating. I'm sure I've saved him from crying into buckets of money now, so this reread has gone to good cause.)",19,0.7826,0.112,0.765,0.123,0.6018029675638372,NEGATIVE,0.6809

I kept feeling that if it was either good or bad, I would have relished finishing it so that I could relish talking about it.But it wasn't. And so I didn't. It was, I guess, the most mediocre book I've ever read.

And so on.In then end, if you ask me whether I liked the book, I'd simply have to respond with a shrug and one of those perplexed looks that doubles for I don't know.NOTE: far more interesting than the actual book is the author's account of the bloody illustration that ended up on newer additions of the book.

8,200781049,08/21/2011,4.0,"This book made Curious Incident fans wail and gnash their teeth in 2006. Who knows how Haddon’s reputation fares today, following the lukewarm response to this breezy domestic drama? I get the impression children’s voices are more his forte, what with being a bestselling kids' author and all. In fact, some of the best lines in this book belong to the toddler Jacob and revolve around poo and ice cream. But this is hardly worth a literary excommunication. It is the sort of book only established authors can release, but it does satisfy as a “warm-hearted page-turner” (does anyone else feel sick?)George is the centre of the story, a retired bourgeois gent who becomes a hypochondriac, a depressive and—later on, when he watches his wife being ploughed by another man—a self-harming borderline psychotic. His descent into madness while his selfish little brood run around arguing and breaking up and making up forms the moral centre of the book, though Haddon works hard to make the selfish people loveable in the end, and almost succeeds. Katie is still about as pleasant as a wet haddock in the face, and the mother is Hyacinth Bouquet without the moral compass. The men are nicer. The women not so nice. Discuss.So there isn’t much in the way of style, originality or humour—this is David Nicholls territory, best left to David Nicholls—but it does provide an engaging and cosy alternative to being alive for a few hours, and that’s perhaps the best thing a book can offer.",15,0.9321,0.087,0.774,0.139,0.469551282051282,NEGATIVE,0.9788
9,12506283,01/14/2008,4.0,"A very entertaining and intelligent ""page-turner"", which is a rare combination of traits. As a story told from four well-written viewpoints, it succeeds in evoking an emotional connection with the characters. But I worry about too much modern fiction presenting the literary equivalent of short serial television episodes all jumbled together in something described as a novel. I suppose readers' attention spans are becoming shorter, but should fiction really cater to that fact? There is definitely a craft to revealing multiple characters' motivations without resorting to the division of a book into 144 chapters written from different perspectives. It made me feel like a choose-your-own-adventure reader when I flipped through dozens of pages to continue on with one character's story for more than just four paragraphs at a time. However, I have to say that the device certainly worked. I really couldn't put this book down, even while cooking. The characters felt three-dimensional (flawless in their depiction, in fact) and the plot was realistic yet unpredictable.Just one teensy complaint: all four narrators had too many reveries about family holidays to foreign countries. Obviously this was a ploy to show just how close-knit this clan really is, but some other flashback options would have been appreciated. ...Or maybe we are to believe that the only time this family really existed together was on vacation, which is quite possible.Just the right amount of convincing character arcs made this book worthy of an overused jacket-blurb adjective: heartwarming.

10,6089677,09/12/2007,2.0,"Having read  Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, I expected my sophomore foray into Haddon's style of novel-writing to be a bit of a departure. If you don't know already the book was written from the point-of-view of a boy with Asperger's Syndrome (a functional form of Autism) and delivered with a fair amount of empathy that warmed the reader to an otherwise antisocial and charmless character.However, I felt that even from an omniscient point-of-view, Haddon hardly piqued my personal interest in any of the central players in this book. It's written in a matter-of-fact style that hearkens back to that of Curious but fails to deliver a real story. The jacket hinted that the hero would be George, a retired father and cuckold with a nagging topical infirmity but my mind wandered so often that I found it far more interesting to read the book as though the protagonist was the tension between each of the family members centered around him. (Try this - it was actually more fascinating than trying to patiently wait for a real story). The bottom line is that the novel goes nowhere while switching from character to character where the writer may or may not be attempting to impress the reader with his gift for communing with unrelated elements of human discord. In other words, English people are boring. This may not be the case but the book makes a strong argument to the contrary.On the positive side, he does seamlessly transition between voices throughout the book with some alacrity and I do think he has a penchant for delivering a fitting description of what one's state of mind is in the most mundane of circumstances. I was also impressed by how well he wrote without using a cliché chain of simile after simile. Again, this is another symptom of my mind wandering from lack of interest but I am fond of writers who can deliver their craft without a notepad full of brilliant adjective phrases right next to the computer.In any case, I would still recommend taking a look at it if you read Curious and plan to keep tabs on Haddon's evolution from writing children's books.

His portrayals of the middle-aged are in places laughable. Mark, I've got to tell you: people over fifty don't think the world belongs to the young. They don't think they're obsolete. It's young people who think that about their elders. Youngsters are often (not always) better at the very latest technology, but that's their only advantage. Well, that, and the good health they take for granted. Also, Haddon writes here about people with no real problems, which is to say, the characters are well-off, not in physical want or peril, and advantaged in every way. Yet they suffer. And whine. At length. But that is what characters in novels do. At least Haddon has them whine interestingly and about problems that we absolutely relate to. After all, lots of readers are whiners, too.Callowness (and shallowness) aside, A Spot of Bother is great writing. Haddon explores deep and painful areas in a way that reads fast and easily, with just the right kind of humor in just the right places. It's as much a riveting page-turner as any thriller, and nearly as suspenseful.

The style doesn't make you think otherwise as the sentences are connected by endless and... and.. and.. I know Haddon was going for wry and humourous but it's a tricky thing. He was definitely trying too hard and made me cringe quite often. He was also clearly abusing the word 'clearly'. The editor clearly changed some of the 'clearlys' to 'apparently' and 'obviously' but at least one 'clearly' per every other page made it through. There were lots of cliff hangers achieved mostly by characters not having a mobile phone, not answering their mobile phone or forgetting their mobile phone. Not exactly very sophisticated.

George has recently retired and married to Jean, who is (as he discovers without her knowledge after aborting a trip away) having an affair with his old colleague David. Their daughter Katie having been left with a hyperactive son Jacob by her first husband Graham announces her engagement to the dependable Ray (seemingly a working class ex rugby player, who her family dislike as being not intelligent enough for her and who Katie herself is not sure she loves so much as depends on). Ray realises over time that Katie doesn’t really love him and walks out when he finds her chatting to Graham, before returning to her. Their (unacknowledged although known by them) gay son Jamie is unwilling to commit to a relationship with a builder Tony and his reluctance to invite him to the wedding causes Tony to walk out (although he comes back part way through the wedding). George discovers a lesion on his leg which he is convinced is cancerous even though assured it is eczema and begins a descent into a form of madness where he alternates between lethargy and panic attacks over his fear of death. His family – particularly Jean – try to rationalise and ignore his behaviour even when he ends up in hospital after hacking the flesh off his leg. The book culminates in the wedding where George attacks David.The easy reading style and examination of the issues of madness and (mis)communication are links with the previous book – but this story is very unremarkable and gave me little insight into George’s true state of mind or world-view which is a huge contrast to its predecessor..",8,0.231,0.083,0.841,0.076,0.4736111111111112,NEGATIVE,0.9913

25,111214962,07/12/2010,3.0,"First (for me) there was The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. I still remember how I cried at the end, wept buckets, loved it. Then there was the book of poetry, The Talking Horse and the Sad Girl and the Village Under the Sea. Great title. What was inside did little for me. And now, remaindered, hard-back, handsome, A Spot of Bother.Expectations were lowered after the damp-squib poetry. Perhaps that was good because very quickly this novel started to delight me. It’s all relationships, all relationships in one family in which the central character (57 year old George – same age as me), is going potty, partly because of his fear of death and mostly because he walks in on his wife in bed with a former colleague. Such a possibility has simply never occurred to him and he doesn’t even tell them what he’s seen. It makes him profoundly sad – sad about his whole life and his place in the universe. His reaction, which looks to all intents and purposes like lunacy, is actually perfectly logical.Meanwhile, there’s his daughter Katie, about to get married for the second time and not sure whether or not she loves the bridegroom (though she undoubtedly adores her son from her first marriage), and Jamie, the gay son who nearly loses the first partner he has ever loved simply because he hasn’t learned how to do relationships. And there’s David, the man George’s wife is ‘shagging’ (but it’s more than that). All these relationships having ups and downs. Short chapters. Poignant, memorable moments. Several times I was crying again, though lots of this is also funny. Haddon is good at getting you inside the heads of each of the characters in turn – right inside. Jean, who is so surprised to find herself having this affair (“Something people did on television”) and trying to work out what’s missing in her life: “She washed up her sandwich plate and stacked it in the rack. The house seemed suddenly rather drab. The sale round the base of the taps. The cracks in the soap. The sad cactus.”It’s simple, good, satisfying writing. The pace builds. You get more and more involved. The plot centres on Katie’s wedding – will it or won’t it happen? Will Jamie’s lover, Tony, actually appear? Will George run away (he does his damnedest)? Will Jean end up with George, or David?The climax—and it is a sort of comic climax—you can see this as a film—is Katie’s wedding. Up to this point I was loving this book, identifying with each of the characters in turn and gradually working out that George really was the hero.The final dénouement when George has it out with David is the point where the novel failed for me. By this time I expect my expectations were too high. I wanted something out of the ordinary to happen and I hadn’t quite seen that Haddon had dropped David’s point of view entirely as George’s took up more and more emotional space. George is the ‘Christopher’ of this book (never any doubt who you’re inside in the Curious Incident). I hadn’t quite seen that the novel was going to end up thunk in the middle of familyness: all these people who love each other, with the homosexual couple simply as a slight variation on the norm, decisions being possible to secure emotional ‘rightness’, the uncertainty and the madness a sort of passing phase. I like this novel. I like it a lot. But the ending is not profound. It is just okay. One other slight reservation was when each relationship reaches its intensest moment, compare the language Jamie and Tony get with what’s accorded to Katie and Ray:“Jamie just pulled him close and snogged him in the middle of the dancefloor for the whole three minutes and three whole minutes of Tony’s cock pressed against him was more than he could actually bear and he was drunk enough by now, so he pulled Tony upstairs and told him not to make any noise or he’d kill him and they went into this old bedroom and Tony fucked him in full view of Big Giraffe and the boxed set of Doctor Dolittle.”“He lifted her head and put a finger on her lips to stop her speaking and kissed her. It was the first time they had kissed properly in weeks.He led her upstairs and they made love until Jacob had a nightmare about an angry blue dog and they had to stop rather quickly.”Katie and Ray make love. For the boys, Jamie gets a magnificent fuck. Hm. I do see, putting them together, that both sexual experiences are set against a sort of comical and appealing reality of innocence and childhood (Big Giraffe and angry blue dog). And I guess it all depends what you’re trying to do in a novel. This one does have something to say about the difficulty of relationships and how the word ‘love’ doesn’t always seem to match whatever it is you have – and still whatever it is you have may be the right thing, the loving thing. But it pushes a little bit farther than that, I think, and then draws back at the end in favour of a neat pattern, a good structure, a satisfactory ending. I’m glad I read it though, and I want to see what Haddon does next.",5,0.9942,0.08,0.789,0.131,0.5350941996736391,POSITIVE,0.9385

45,2807608267,07/26/2019,4.0,"""A Spot Of Bother"" is a humane, humorous look a man slowly unravelling in retirement and the reaction of his family to his slide into mental illness. It gets us inside the heads of an older couple and their adult children, showing, with a mix of wit, acute social observation and admirable empathy, how they try to cope with lives that are not the ones that they expected to live but are the only ones they have. As the title suggests, this is a very polite, very English view of dealing with personal crises by trying to pretend that they're not happening, or, if they are, then convincing yourself that they can be fixed by carrying on as normal for as long as possible. George Hall has always been a quiet, responsible man. Now he is slowly, quietly, and with as little inconvenience to others as he can manage, being overwhelmed by mental illness. He suffers from constant anxiety and panic attacks that bring him to his knees. He has convinced himself that what his doctor diagnoses as eczema is really a fatal form of cancer. He is aware that this is probably not a rational conclusion but it's not a belief he can free himself from. Nor can he share that belief with others, especially with the way things are with his family. So he continues alone until he does something that no one can ignore. Although this sounds like a source of humour and is handled lightly at times, the thing that came through most strongly to me was how George's illness isolated him, leaving him deeply afraid, quietly desperate and totally unable to ask for help. This felt very real to me. Jean, George's wife of many years is portrayed honestly and non-judgementally. Given her frustration at having George under her feet all the time after decades of having to live her life mostly in his absence and her affair with an ex-colleague of George's, she could have been a stock comedy figure. Instead, we see the world through her eyes understand that her life and her loves aren't that simple. George and Jean are put under stress by their children who are going through dramas of their own and who both seem to be attracted to men who are not from either the class of the culture that their parents would have chosen. Their divorced with one child daughter, Katie, announces her intention to marry the not-quiet-smart-enough-or-well-read-enough Ray. He's very nice of course and so good with Katie's son. He's solid, dependable chap, but is he really someone their daughter should marry? Their gay but only recently come out of the closet son, Jamie has a relationship with a very working-class young man that the family has never met. The upcoming wedding stresses Jamie's relationship and makes him question the comfortable but perhaps overly-safe life he's built for himself. What I enjoyed most about this book was the skilled storytelling. The chapters are short. Each one immerses the reader in the mind of a member of the family. The plot is carefully crafted to get the most humour and tension from the interlocking characters while the voices of the characters keep the story real, reflecting the ambiguities and confusions and complex emotions of people who are dealing with what life is dishing out to them. I recommend listening to the audiobook version of ""A Spot Of Bother"". It's narrated with skill and precision by Alex Jennings.",2,0.5532,0.112,0.772,0.116,0.5256362217017955,POSITIVE,0.9999

Interesting, because characters were stuck in their ruts, and the writing itself seemed weighed down by that. Or perhaps, especially in comparison to The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time with its single character focus, Haddon had so many personalities on his hands that he needed a while to wrestle each of them into form and get them all moving in the right direction. In the first half, he seemed to be trying a little too hard to be profound.Once their lives all started to disintegrate, especially when George started to truly lose it, things got interesting and very, very funny. George's pivotal scene in the bathtub was brilliantly rendered, and the novel picked up pace and started to cohere from that point on. The lead-up to and climax of the wedding scene was similarly fabulous, reading like a French farce.A note on style: I loved (but again, only really noticed by the half-way point--was this intentional?) the step back in time and change of perspective at each chapter break as the story unfolded. The technique was not as overt and clearly-demarcated as Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible, and more integrated with the main plot. The effect was one of truly being able to see the events from each character's perspective, and gaining empathy with each of them. The link to theme was therefore powerful, illustrating people bonded by blood and family ties, but feeling misunderstood, lonely and remote from each other because of their own lack of self-awareness and ability to empathize and communicate honestly with each other.As the story went on, as the characters were growing closer to each other and gaining insight into their own motivations, the ""steps back"" became closer in time, which is perhaps why I only started to notice them at about the half-way point.This one'll make a fine movie, I think.

But never before have I put down a book and immediately gone and fetched another offering from the same author and started to read it. At 9:30pm.

His previous book is The curious Incident of the dog in the Night – Time and I started reading that again last night after finishing this one.A Spot of Bother is an amazing story. It had me smiling out loud and almost weeping with sympathy. Essentially it is the story of a family getting ready for a wedding. But actually it is the story of a dignified old man trying to politely go crazy in public. The characters are completely believable – every single one of them. The writing goes from tiny minutely detailed moments to sweeping paragraphs covering the rest of the day. The conversations are so ordinary as to seem familiar and the situations so ludicrous to remain fantastic.Mark Haddon looks like the kind of man you would watch football with at the pub and then share a takeout curry with at the bus stop; he looks like a working class boy from the docks. But he writes with the skill of the angels. In this book of his the story is told from the point of view of the main adult characters – and as each he writes in a completely believable way. He is a gay 30 year old lost and marginally fucked in the head; he is a 60 something year old woman having late life affair; he is a 20 something woman trying to work out if she loves her fiancée; and best of all – he is George, he is losing his mind and he is trying to do it discreetly. I was totally absorbed from start to finish. I am smitten by the writings of this man.These books are going to be hard to read and release.

The story follows George, a recently retired middle class English man, and his family, going about their normal lives, with one glaring difference; George has discovered a lesion on his hip. He is dying of cancer. Or at least he believes he is. George is a hypochondriac with a very British stiff upper lip. He desperately tries to go about his life as though nothing is changing. He keeps working on the studio he is building in his garden. He listens to jazz and helps with the preparations for his daughter's wedding, until he starts to find himself hyperventilating in the garden, walking out of a shop wearing a pair of trousers he hasn't paid for, standing in the shower with a pair of scissors hovering over his lesion. Meanwhile, practically unnoticed by George, his family is in tatters. His wife is having an affair, his daughter is about to embark on her second marriage, to a man with 'Strangler's Hands', and his son is too embarrassed by his family to allow them to meet his boyfriend. This book is another excellent exploration into mental health issues by Haddon. It gives the victim a voice. And that voice is sometimes uncomfortably hilarious, briskly understated and nakedly vulnerable. George is not the crazed madman we are used to reading about. He is not other. He is the most normal man you could ever imagine which is what makes this story so much more compelling, believable, and often difficult to read.

How wrong I was.This was one of the most exhausting reads I've ever endured. In fact, the only book I've ever enjoyed as little as this was Stephen King's Insomnia. The family that took center stage in this unthrilling tale was dysfunctional enough to make it into the pages of a Jacqueline Wilson novel. I get that every family have their little quirks, but this book just took the piss. Every family member were going through their own personal major turmoils, and the idea that this was supposed to represent 'real family life' was laughable.One of the most annoying things about this failed piece of literature was that in every single chapter, no matter how short, the character in question had some major, life altering epiphany. One big realization per book is about the limit of what looks realistic. If these revelations were about minor things, like 'of course, jam and butter on my toast is what I need now', that would have been fine. I certainly would have had something to say about it, but it's better than what did happen, which were sickening moments of clarity about the big questions in life; Death, Love, Life. You felt exhausted after reading ten pages of this!This was such a god awful piece of writing that it's almost funny. Almost.

I appreciate, and agree, with other reviewers who have noted that if one reads Spot expecting a new, different, or improved Curious, they will be disappointed.

Critical analysis of families, and relationships, and incipient maddness, or petulant children, or homosexuals, or extramarital affairs, or second marriages?

Mark Haddon still does a fantastic job of showing rather than telling in terms of his characters--he really has a wonderful way of letting the reader get inside the characters' heads. I think that was part of what made his first novel great, and he has held onto that in this one. What made this one almost better than Curious Incident was the abundance of poignant moments. This book does not lack for meaningful segments but also doesn't overdo it. I sat and thought about certain passages for long periods of time--they took me back, made me laugh, and made me think.

The homosexual encounters were unnecessarily graphic, and Haddon's occasional digs at Christianity come across as needlessly pissy. Haddon was apparently attempting to push people's buttons a bit with this one, perhaps wanting to distance himself from his reputation as the writer of the incredibly charming and internationally best-selling THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHTTIME. Unfortunately, A SPOT OF BOTHER is a book desperately in need of some charm. It's mostly a story of small-minded people behaving in inexplicable ways.

As things progress it seems that everyone’s lives are falling apart due to the interrelated events & fears they all harbour & we get the feeling that if only they were honest with each other things would be so much smoother... it remains excruciatingly well observed; I hated that I related to some of the experiences of the 57 year old central character who’s crippled with anxiety & is going quite mad!I was surprised to find I read this in just a week - it really does draw you along without much effort & I found myself reading it the morning before work & looking forward to getting home later to pick it up again. It was like waiting for an inevitable car crash happening in front of your eyes in slow motion... you will the characters to just ask that next question, just find out what’s really going on... but people fail to say what’s on their minds & miss finding out that the other person isn’t really thinking & feeling what they thought they were; like so often happens in real life, sadly.This is a much easier read than my last one; I did a rough word count (I might have over-estimated with this one as there’s lots of chapters (144) & therefore a fair few blank & half pages) & it has about 160,000 words compared to the 207,000 of the last one... not as many fewer as I thought; so it’s an easier read... I read these 500 pages in half the time it took to read those 460 pages... maybe state of mind has a part to play, & busyness too... I do feel like I’m reading quicker & still taking more in as well at the moment; maybe it really is an acquired skill, improved with lots of practice, this reading thing....?I found it hard to feel sorry for George, as much as I identified with his time in life; I know that stress causes heightened emotions & that we struggle to think straight & make sensible decisions or any decisions at all in that state of mind but it was hard to see where the stress was really coming from; stress, anxiety & depression don’t need ‘good reasons’ to take hold though, do they? Perhaps I’ve been lucky & this is how easy it can be to spiral out of control into a depressive maelstrom. Also, going mad is only relative; when you know a person’s motivation for a course of action it seems perfectly logical but without the context it could so easily look sectionable... we wonder why George held on to what he discovered & kept it to himself, but it was clearly not helpful!I really like the book & will probably reflect on the little moments of wisdom, well-observed scenes from everyday life & insights into how we all think for a while to come; our obsession with our appearance & social convention; the way we take responsibility for things which are really not our fault at all; things we think when we’re sitting on the toilet; the stress of having a young child balanced against the proper perspective kids can bring to the most trying of circumstances & the way they can take the heat out of a situation just by being there & having their own needs; the things we do on our own when we’re not being watched (like doing a little pirouette as we move from one side of the kitchen to another which we’d never do if someone was watching) the extent to which we’re bound by convention & the way we always thought & saw the world & the way we realise the truth about a situation only when things have fallen apart.The style of the writing is quite pacey, jovial & humorous but as things progress & it becomes clear that George is experiencing some really quite serious difficulties maintaining his grip on reality & a proper perspective on things I ended up not being sure if the tone & subject matter always quite matched. There are many small, overlapping chapters, conveying the plot from the perspective of the different characters; the pace is frenetic & undermines the descriptions on the cover suggesting subtlety, lightness of touch & tenderness… I was breathless with it & found it a bit oppressive at times; I wanted to press on & find out what happens but some of that was just so I could stop & catch my breath. Are these people really rather incapable & thoughtless? We don’t really behave like this do we? I suppose people do... at the start of the book it felt insightful & well observed but by the end the big event the whole book has been building up to seems to amplify the quirky humanity into downright stupidity... maybe that’s what the book is saying?Highly recommended, I want to give it 3.5 stars out of 5 but pressed to give whole numbers it gets a 4*!",0,0.9776,0.092,0.788,0.12,0.4606532356532356,POSITIVE,0.9992

It was surprisingly easy for me to get involved in the problems these characters created for themselves.

The book’s excessive length is attributable in part to Haddon’s constant references to things like “that time in Margate with Maureen and Geoffrey”, which I think aims to build the world beyond these four characters but rings too hollow to be effective. Nothing about this world felt real or interesting, and nothing about these characters felt illuminating or engaging. If I weren’t the sort of stubborn person who always finishes a book once I’ve started, there’s no way I would have made it past the first 100 pages.Also, one chapter is basically one character retelling an episode of Bob The Builder to us, which is right up there with the most inexplicable editorial choices I have ever encountered in my long life of reading books.",0,0.6869,0.055,0.857,0.088,0.49745670995671,NEGATIVE,1.0

That honestly didn't bother me too much...after all, I love The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, and very little happens in that novel. I think what got me the most was the characters. Yes, they're engaging, but in the sense that you want to smack and yell at them. So many of the mistakes that happen that lead to the climax are a result of them not FREAKING TALKING to each other or having basic listening skills.

He is a self-contained man who doesn’t easily open up even to his wife so he tries to find his own solutions.

One of the key themes is mental illness / acute depression and our patient - poor George - is a very likeable, sympathetic character struggling with very real problems.

If one person really enjoys a book, you can bet your bottom dollar that there is another person out there who will loathe the same exact book, for their own reasons. However, this is precisely why I LOVE to read books so much. I really enjoy finding the books that no one can agree upon; where half the people really like the book and the other half really don't. I like to read their reasonings behind their ratings, read the book for myself, and come to my own conclusions. A Spot of Botherwas one of those reads for me. Alot of people said it was just was as good as Haddon's first book, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, which I liked quite a bit and then there were the ones that said it just wasn't as good, which they found disappointing at best. There wasn't alot of middle ground to say the least and it was for all of these reasons, that curiousity got the best of me and I ended up picking up this story in order to find out for myself what was in store. Well, let's just say I'm very glad I did.After finishing this book, I couldn't get the damn story out of my head.

Dick quote automatically comes to mind, ""It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.""For me the books that linger the most in my mind are the character based stories, shown to the reader through details (even the most mundane ones) in such a way that enchantment is gained through a kind of stylistic invisibility. This book totally made me forget that I was reading a novel and I felt more like a fly on the wall in this family's home, watching it all unfold.From beginning to end, this book was a treat for me.

Because, the characters are so poorly sketched, they seem very unreasonable, unnatural, absurd at times and even selfish. Through out the novel, George seemed to be having a pathetic time, yet I could not bring myself to empathise with him, coz the whole act seemed very fake and artificial. The writing style lacked poise and warmth. There are 140+ chapters in this 592 paged book, some of them as short as one page. I could not understand why the book was formatted in that why, it didn't make it an easy read for me. There were some points when, things seemed amusing and funny, but soon you would get something equally nonsensical and absurd that things will be squared off. I particularly did not like the way the novel ended. I was expecting something more sensible, more reasonable after going through the 592 pages (skipping a few pages in between), but was dissappointed with a rather rushed upon end. The characters did not seem to have learnt a lesson from the turn of events in their life and still, as fate might have it, things worked out smoothly for everybody finally. I could not figure out the reason behind that. After giving the story such a slow and rather detailed build up, Haddon could have ended the story more pragmaticallyAfter having enjoyed Haddon's The Curious Case of the dog at the Night Time', I was looking forward to a similar experience in 'A Spot of Bother'. But it turned out to be a big let down for me. ",0,0.9406,0.064,0.841,0.095,0.6082539682539683,NEGATIVE,1.0

It has the same flavor as the first, but with multiple main characters instead of just one. (I did not find them to be too many, as others are saying.)Mark Haddon still does a fantastic job of showing rather than telling in terms of his characters--he really has a wonderful way of letting the reader get inside the characters' heads. I think that was part of what made his first novel great, and he has held onto that in this one. Haddon writes well and is able to portray his characters both in angst and in happiness, which adds to the plot since one finds themselves identifying with the feelings of love, confusion, and upset. It is also an interesting perspective of how parents try to relate and understand their grown children and their decisions.What made this one almost better than Curious Incident was the abundance of poignant moments. This book does not lack for meaningful segments but also doesn't overdo it. I sat and thought about certain passages sometimes --they really made me think. I highly recommend this book to those who liked the first book for more than just its focus on a kid with a developmental disorder. He was very interesting, but I liked this family much more. They were more real, and quite a bit dysfunctional as any other family, only they had much more class, being English and all.The only parts of the book I had a hard time with, were (1) that the panic attacks were difficult to deal with, if you've ever had one. (2) The ""scissors"" scene made me cringe, and race through -- I cannot understand anyone being that sick, they could do this to themselves. But then again, I am a big baby when it comes to pain, having had so much of it already. (3) I had a hard time with the ending, what with the (very English??) ""let's get over with this, and on with things"" attitude the main character seemed to suddenly BE ABLE to develope.. if you have EVER been depressed, this does not happen quite so quickly, or so easily. I don't care if you're English, and have that ""stiff upper lip"" mentality. That man needed LOTS more therapy, and anti-depressants.

Who among us is really all that comfortable with mental illness....??)My favorite passage, of which there were many:""What was Jamie going to say? It seemed so obvious what he felt.

The most unselfish character in the entire book was George - and he's the one losing his marbles.They are characterized and restricted by their problems. The whole book - all 500 pages of it - was all about how they fucked shit up by being the kind of person they are. It was about a wedding and how everyone prepared for it while secretly hating someone involved in it. It's about what they had for lunch and how their lives are now ruined because they were an ass.You ride along with them for 500 odd pages, and in the end everyone gets a happy ending but nobody really changes as a person. No development, nada. No one had a heart-to-heart. Most questions were unanswered. Does Jacob eventually accepts Ray as a stand-in dad? Fuck if I know.

The fucking name throwing.You'd think after trundling with them for 400 pages, you'd think they can't throw a name that I don't know. Well, THINK AGAIN.

This one is about as different as it’s possible to be, and it’s also pretty impressive. George Hall is in his sixties, a retired builder of playground equipment, who has always been a little off-center in his methods of dealing with life. Mostly, he tries to ignore things that make him uncomfortable -- even more than your typical Englishman. Things like jetliner crashes and dying of cancer. He’s coping with retirement in part by learning to lay brick and building a small art studio at the bottom of his garden. Meanwhile, his wife, Jean, has been coping with George by having an affair with one of his ex-colleagues. It isn’t that George doesn’t care, exactly, but he doesn’t often show it and David simply makes her feel good. And David kind of wants Jean to leave George. Meanwhile, their daughter, Katie, who is really hard work, and who has a child by a guy who walked out on her, is contemplating marriage with Ray, who has a nice house and makes good money, even though he’s large and hyper-masculine and not as intelligent as she is. But Ray brims with natural competence and he’s really, really good with Jacob, and he loves her. It doesn’t matter that her family seems uneasy, almost a little afraid of Ray. Meanwhile, Jacob, being about three and semi-hyperactive, is fixated on Bob the Builder and Power Rangers, and on asking whether Grandpa is dying. (No, dear, Grandpa is just having a breakdown.) Meanwhile, Katie’s younger brother, Jamie, who is an estate agent and gay (Katie taught him everything he knows about self-defense), has just broken up with Tony, who has finally had it with Jamie’s inability to stop being single and in control of absolutely everything in order to love someone else. Having laid out these separate lives for the reader’s perusal, Haddon then stands back and allows them all to gradually merge. George sees something he wasn’t meant to see and decides to engage in do-it-yourself cancer surgery. Jamie finds himself actually bonding with Ray. Ray wonders whether, for her own good, Katie ought really to be marrying him. Jean has no idea what’s going on but she’s making sure the nuptials come off properly and on schedule. And it all comes together in one of the most dramatically entertaining weddings you’re likely to see.

Before I read this book, I saw a lot of comments pertaining to why Haddon's other book (The Curious Incident of Dog....) is a lot better than this one. I never really got the chance to read that one though, so I really have no point of reference to compare A Spot of A Bother with. But regardless of that, I think this one is a classic comic fiction that once again tackles how difficult and troubling some American families are. It has Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections overtones. And as I read this book, it reminded me how I got annoyed by simply perusing Franzen's work. In spite of that, I found A Spot of a Bother a hundred folds better than the corrections. So much for point of reference. This is all about a modern American family whose members are troubled at some points in their lives. The father, George, is a paranoid old guy who thinks he has cancer when in fact he only has a thick lump of skin which the doctor diagnosed as a weird case of eczema. On the other hand, the mother (Jean) finds little or almost no romance with her relationship with George. So what she did is basically look for another guy, David, who is an old acquaintance. One time George saw Jean having sex with David, in his very bed. That was the ultimatum of George's hysteria. He's got a little bit, or should I say, totally unhinged. Just what I thought. Their siblings have their generous portion of troubles. Katie, who's about to get married to Ray, backed out from their marriage. Then she realized that she really likes Ray so the wedding went on again. Jamie, Katie's younger brother, a homosexual, the ""sanest member of the family"", got chucked by Tony. That's basically the troubling premise of the novel. More stupid things happened and I found myself laughing from time to time. This book is a major break from all the technical stuff that I've been reading at school. It's funny in some sort of way, but kinda stupid in another. I don't know about the family members, but I really don't get it why they can't cope decently to the things that have been going on around them.They tend to lose their sanity, and even rationality occasionally.

As evinced by Gardens of the Moon and The Good Soldier Švejk still malingering there, that didn't actually happen. However, I did manage to clear this one off the list in a last-ditch attempt to accomplish something.If the author sounds familiar, it's because Mark Haddon also wrote (massively popular) The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Do not read A Spot of Bother expecting anything like a repeat - this is very different. In fact, the only common threads I could find were a) both books are set in England and b) the main character has a mental illness (anxiety, not autism), and these connections are tenuous at best given how they are handled.With a large cast exploring different aspects of middle-class British life and small-scale, private tragedies to drive the plot, A Spot of Bother has a lot more in common with books like White Teeth.It all starts with George, set in his ways with his life crumbling around him. George is more than a little racist, more than a little homophobic, and he has found himself in a spot of trouble with his daughter getting married. Again. Instead of focusing on that, he obsesses about a spot his GP refuses to believe is cancer.

139,2418215622,06/09/2018,4.0,"Mark Haddon is truly a jack of all trades, having spent his life doing an assortment of jobs, but he always retained a rather creative outlet. He started his literary career with children's books, many of which he illustrated himself. He has also published a poetry collection and works on screenplays. While he does have this quite impressive writing background, I never would have heard of him had it not been for the 2003 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. The book received much praise and numerous awards, all which it well deserved. A mystery, the book is from the point of view of a 15 year old boy with something akin to autism. Haddon never says what the boy has, but the description points to autism/aspergers. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is a mystery, but it's certainly not genre-fiction. Christopher, our hero/detective, discovers the body of his neighbor's dog and decides to investigate the murder of the pooch. During this investigation, Christopher also goes on a search for his supposedly dead mother. I found different and beautifully done, so when I saw Haddon had published another novel, I snagged. A Spot of Bother (2006) continues with a story told through someone with mental issues and focuses strongly on the family unit. It's horribly depressing, yet laughingly so. I suppose that's life though, you don't know if you should laugh or cry, or kill yourself.The small chapters of the book are snapshots into various family members' lives. The story revolves around and starts with George, the father. George is an older man. He lives with his wife, Jean. His two children, Jamie & Katie are grown. He has a grandson, Jacob. And I should mention he's crazy as a loon. Old age and retirement have made in a first-class crazy person. A hypochondriac who will convince the reader that maybe s/he should get that skin lesion checked out. That's how it starts; George see this skin spot/lesion and becomes convinced it's cancer. This slowly makes him insane. At one point, he rocks on the floor on all fours moo-ing like a cow to keep calm. He manages to swallow his panic and go to a doctor where is told it's just eczema and is given a steroid cream. This helps briefly. Later, George begins to medicate and calm himself with codeine, Valium, and wine.Jean is a little bit oblivious to her husband's insanity. She is not home often as she is having an affair with George's former colleague, David. (An affair the George learns about by watching it happen. The description of two older people engaged in sex is not exactly romantic.) Jean is a busybody who needs someone to take care of, and as she realizes her husband isn't well, she begins to feel better about herself. She is also a guilt-tripping controlling mom. She is less than pleased about her daughter's upcoming wedding. And she's completely concerned with what people with think if her son shows up to the wedding with his boyfriend. She was not a likeable character for me, but she was a very believable one.Katie, a single-mother, has some serious anger issues. She's also a bit like her mother and much concerned with appearances. That said, she thinks she is too good for Ray, a commoner (and a belief held by her parents), but he takes care of her and Jacob and marrying him will truly piss her mom off. Katie has had a string of men who are ""perfect"" as far as appearances go. They are well-read, well-educated, respectably employed at a respectable job, muscled, tan, beautiful to look at. And generally sorry lots. That pretty much describes her first husband and Jacob's father. Her and Ray are a bizarre fit. The wedding gets called off. She panics because she is afraid he'll toss her out. An all around good guy, Ray assures her he won't, that they'll figure it out, but he cares about her and Jacob too much to just toss them on the street.Jamie has created a new life away from his family. But when he hears about the wedding, his life falls apart. His boyfriend, Tony, wants to come. Tony has never been introduced to Jamie's family and Jamie has never really come out to his family (they know, but they pretend otherwise). Tony leaves Jamie because he doesn't think Jamie loves him, at least he doesn't love him enough to take him home. (And we all know that's the test of any relationship.) Jamie falls apart. The problems in his life make it difficult for him to give his attention to his father's crazy or his sister's looney or his mother's wtf moments.So what happens? Does George go completely nuts? Does he ever tell Jean he knows about the affair? Does the affair stop? Does the wedding happen? Does George attack David at the wedding? (Okay, that might give a bit away.) Are there suicide attempts? Does Tony come back? Does Jamie get a new man? Is the person at the bed/breakfast that Jamie's mother puts him in after doing research to see what ""his kind"" would like a man to woman tranny? Does Katie get involved with her ex? Is there a horrible sex scene between two men that starts off hot and heavy and ends with food poisoning? (Yes. I will answer that one. Yes.) Does George become better or worse? Does his marriage to Jean survive or does she leave him?It's a good book and a rather quick read. The fragmented sections of snippets makes it a very speedy read that is easy to follow. Haddon doesn't get all flowery and descriptive, he keeps his story nicely on track. This whole family is spiraling out of control independent of each other. The story, the spot of bother, is what happens when they're spiraling into each other. Can they survive it?

212,1920848154,03/22/2017,1.0,"1.5 stars rounded down to 1.On the back of this book, the Independent on Sunday is quoted saying, ""a witty and subtle family drama."" This book is about as subtle as a stampede of elephants and as witty as a Chemistry seminar. Prior to reading A Spot of Bother, I had read two books by Mark Haddon and thoroughly enjoyed reading them. I considered Mark Haddon to be one of my favourite authors so when I was assigned this book I was thrilled to dive in and explore his new world. However, I really disliked this book. I found many flaws which left me, quite frankly, disappointed. Throughout my review I shall look at the redeemable qualities in this book as well as the reasons I did not like it.The plot of this book is explained to at the speed of a bullet. In the first ten pages we are told everything we could ever want to know about the story and are introduced to many characters. In my review, I shall explain the plot of A Spot of Bother at the speed Mark Haddon does. The focal character of the novel is George and George is married to Jean and have two children called Jamie and Katy. Jamie is gay and is in a long term relationship with Tony, which brings scandal to the family name. While Katy is getting married for the second time to a man named Ray. Katy had a child, Jacob, from her first marriage to a man named Graham, also bringing scandal to the family. But wait that's not all. George has retired and whilst buying a suit for a funeral discovers a lump on his hip, assumes he has cancer and starts to go insane all while Jean is having an affair with David, George's ex-colleague. Keeping up? I certainly wasn't. Because there is such a wide range of characters, reading this kind of felt like a watching an episode of a soap opera that you haven't watched in a couple months. You sort of know some of the characters and get the jist of everything, but aren't experiencing the full complexity of the plot and that annoyed me greatly.Now I shall discuss the redeemable qualities of the novel. I try to read as diversely as possible, meaning most of the books I pick up will include a person of colour, cultural diversity or members of the LGBTQ+ community. With the inclusion of a gay character in the novel, some of his points of views on some of the situations are quite insightful. He provides some interesting discussion on how it feels being closeted and how it feels when his parents tell their friends and family, ""it's just a phase"". Other poignant discussions are present in this book. For example on page 66, when Katy talks about how it can feel to be pitied for a disability and on page 324, when George talks about the difference between sadness and depression. I loved reading these and thought his representation of these people to be elegant, clever and occasionally quite moving.Secondly, I loved Jacob. Jacob is the grandchild and is only 6 years old. The scenes in which he was included made me feel like I was reading about a real child that does exist. It was this mastery that made The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time such a success. The way he captures the childlike innocence of Jacob is similar to Christopher. It was this that made Jacob my favourite character.Finally, I thought Katy was represented as a believable character. How many times have you read about the slightly too skinny, flat-chested, doesn't wear make-up and yet is always flawless and isn't like ""other"" girls, female protagonist? I was happy to find that Katy was not one of these protagonists and I think it would be healthier if more authors followed suit. Sadly, that is all the things I enjoyed in the novel and I must now go on to the things I didn't enjoy.After finishing this novel, I got a pen and came up with 12 things I hated in A Spot of Bother and for the sake of the length of this talk, I have managed to narrow it down to a list of nine things:Number one: The characters on a whole feel two dimensional. They seem to only be their problems and there are no other aspects to their personality. We don't know what they like, what they don't like, their age, their hair colour, anything other than the problem in their life. And for me, that makes me feel like I'm reading about pieces of cardboard, as opposed to real people.Number two: We are given no description of anything in this novel. Another thing, that made The Curious Incident a masterpiece was the description. Because of Christopher's condition everything around him is noticed and we get beautiful imagery to describe what he sees. This is the complete opposite. On the cover we are given an illustration of a house, but we don't know who's house it is because nothing is described. We are given glimpses of what Haddon can do when he says ""The crowd parted like the Red Sea"", but I was very disappointed in the fact that this was an anomaly. Furthermore, there is way too much telling and not enough showing in this book. This is when an author tells us what is happening instead of showing us. For example, numerous times we are told, ""George was angry"". He could've written, ""George's blood was boiling. A vein popped in his forehead as he stomped to the other side of the room and slammed the door, each step creating a sonic bomb"". I felt offended that he didn't let me use my intelligence to work out he was angry from his actions. And with a book that is over 500 pages, you'd expect it to have more descriptionNumber three: This book is very clearly adult fiction. I don't have a problem with sex in books. I understand that it happens and therefore should be talked about, but I don't need to know every single aspect of their private life. Sadly, the only elements of description seem to fall in these parts. We are told everything about the intimate parts of their bodies but you can get to the end of this book and still have no idea what colour the protagonist's hair is. The final nail in the coffin was when disgusting acts take place between Jean and her lover David. I was physically repulsed and had to stop reading after that scene and wish I had never read it. Furthermore, what some of the characters say during the scenes, I find unrealistic and quite frankly sickening. I was going to put in a quote here but couldn't bear to have to say it front of a room of my classmates.Number four: One of the reasons I think the humour is slightly amiss is partly because I am not old enough to have experienced some of the punch lines to the jokes. An example of this is when Tony says, ""This is her life, Jamie. You can't fight off Anne Bancroft with a crucifix and drag her onto the nearest bus."" I'd imagine if I knew who Anne Bancroft was or what he was referencing this would be humorous, but I don't, so it's not. Side note: Google helped me find out Anne Bancroft is an actress and he's referring to a film called 84 Charing Cross Road. Who knew? This isn't the only instance of this either. It happens several times. In fact, I marked my book with post-its every time this happened and as you can see it wasn't an anomaly.Number five: Mark Haddon gets into a habit of introducing wonderfully developed and interesting characters and then snatching them away never to be mentioned again. An example of this is the character of Becky. Becky is Tony's sister and when Jamie goes to visit Tony one day, he ends up talking to Becky. For the first time in the novel we meet a character who is somewhat funny and makes the characters realise their mistakes and fix them but at the end of the chapter she's gone and never heard of again. I don't see why she couldn't have been introduced as a more main character and had her sort everyone's problems out for once and for all. Then the book could've been half the length and everyone would've been happier in the end.Number six: This book is classified as realistic fiction and even the New York Times calls Haddon a realist. But for a realistic book, the events in the book are entirely unrealistic. There are two example I think really illustrate this point. The first scene place when Katy is having a cup of coffee with her ex-husband and Ray enters the café. He sees the two then lifts a bin empties the contents over himself and then throws the bin into the middle of the street. Even more unbelievable is a scene that happens whilst Jamie is hooking up with another man. They have to stop because the other man starts projectile vomiting over everything citing it was the prawns as he's allergic to shellfish, and then... wait for it... goes blind. And before you ask, he is never mentioned again after that, so you have absolutely no idea what happens after that.Number seven: This book is so slow moving. After 500 pages, I looked back and couldn't think of what and actually happened in the 500 pages making it deserving of such a lengthy book. Nothing really happened. It kind of felt as if everything happened within twenty pages and then you had to read another hundred pages until the next block of events. This led me to feeling as if it was dragging on and on. It dragged on so much and I got so bored that halfway through I quit and read Harry Potter instead before finishing it. This to me isn't an indication of a great book at all.Number eight: The genuinely most infuriating part about this book is that some of the biggest plot twists are given away in the blurb. Jean spends a long time deciding whether she should have an affair with David, but because of the blurb, her decision is revealed making her chapters purely filler for the rest of the plot. A similar situation occurs about Katy. Katy makes a big realisation in the middle of the book that she might not actually love the man she is about to marry. However, that was totally predictable because on the blurb it quite literally tells us this and therefore I was waiting for these quote unquote ""twists"". I cannot fathom why publishers feel the need to do this. I would much rather that there was no blurb and we could find these things out for ourselves. It makes no sense that they would want to give away the most important and interesting parts of the narrative.And finally, number nine: I think the worst and most incriminating thing about this book is the message the story seems to have. The only motivation these characters seem to have is their romantic relationships. The characters fall into a depression when they break up with their significant others and then do crazy things like quite their jobs. The characters act to impress their partner instead of doing things because they want to do them. As an impressionable person reading this it made me feel like if I wasn't in a relationship my life is worthless and this is harmful moral in a book.I will never tell anyone not to read a book. If you thought while I explained the plot of A Spot of Bother, it sounded like a great read, then by all means pick this up and read it I'm sure you'd love it. I feel like I have to give a trigger warning for self-harm. If that is something that disturbs you then stay away from this book. I personally didn't enjoy this book, which doesn't mean that you won't. I gave this book 1.5 stars out of 5, because it was wholly unrealistic, confusing, boring and predictable. Perhaps this was because I put this author on pedestal and was disappointed when he fell off. Nevertheless, I did not enjoy reading A Spot of Bother.

213,3583780607,10/28/2020,2.0,"My unsolicited advice to editors of bestselling debut authors is don't stop editing their sophomore efforts at page 40. The story frequently falls apart at the halfway mark and we readers have to slog through to the end even if you don't. A Spot of Bother was an easy four star at the start. I laughed out loud almost from the first page. I loved the characters. I devoured the tone and writing style. I was hooked. And then I reached page 200 of a 354 page novel and suddenly there wasn't any story left. For 150 pages, the reader is treated to a rehash of various issues from the first half of the book, exasperating all the goodwill I originally felt toward the characters. George continues to worry about lesions. Self-medicates. Runs away. Apologizes. Jean is completely incomprehensible. I'm no closer to understanding why she had an affair than I was when the book started. Or why she breaks it off. Or why she dislikes Ray. Or basically anything about her. Katie and Jamie presumably grow because they realize they love the people who love them, but I didn't believe it and I didn't care. Ray is presumed to be ""deeply inappropriate"" and the intended nuptials are ""dreaded."" A lot hangs on this, to the point that George's family are blind to his distress. Unfortunately, Ray is shown to be wonderful throughout. If Katie and Ray have had a ""rollercoaster"" relationship, it's news to me. After hearing Jamie talk about Ray, Becky thinks Ray is a ""suitable candidate for castration."" Seriously?I feel like these people have never held a job, taken a bus, or had to do more than one thing at a time. I'm supposed to see them as damaged, but I don't know why. And by page 200 I should have some idea of what happened to this family to damage them. Consequently the whole thing sags badly and never picks up again. By the time we get to the wedding, it has sunk to the level of a French farce without the laughs. The book version of a Hugh Grant romcom.One last point. The trouble with introducing bigoted characters in order to redeem the main characters is that it just makes the main characters look petty. Eileen is singled out for ridicule because she's surprised to learn that her nephew is gay, overlooking the fact that no one in her family thought to tell her. The reader is meant to join in on the mocking hilarity but we've had an entire book of seeing Jamie's parents (and even Jamie himself to a certain extent) feeling ambivalent about his sexuality, so how is Eileen's reaction out of line?The entire second half is sorely lacking in emotional intelligence.If you're going to write a novel about ""the madness--literally--of family life..."" and ""misdirected love"" then make sure you present the madness of family life and clearly illustrate where love is misdirected or you will only annoy your readers.

Haddon's success in this novel is that he manages all of this family’s madness in a way that seems rather real.""A Spot of Bother"" without a doubt, features a HIGHLY neurotic family as they attempt to navigate through the father's retirement, the mother's affair, the daughter's second wedding and the son's sexuality. It's a comical farce with plenty of laughs, but it's also a touching family tale that all readers will probably be able to relate to on some level(which might sort of be a scary thought). This book is definitely filled with all of the complexities of family life.Throughout the course of the story, all three(?four?) love relationships - George and his wife (and his wife and her lover), their gay son and his significant other, and their daughter and her fiancé are drastically challenged. Breakups occur, self-reflections kick in, and attempts to communicate and re-build relationships meet with varying degrees of success. But during the daughter Katie & Ray's wedding, the perfect storm of dark comedy ensues and somehow it winds up bringing everything together. Not perfectly together by any means, but enough so that you come away realizing that the UNCONDITIONAL LOVE in some families runs quite deep indeed.So in the end, please BE BOTHERED to read Haddon’s book.This guy knows how to tell a story.

I thought about giving it one star, but I gave one star to Twilight, and it's not as bad as that; I didn't have to virtually flog myself to finish reading it. So, where to begin? I suppose I'll start with the abysmal, one dimensional characters. The story follows the lives of four dreary people, two parents with two extraordinarily self-centered, obnoxious offspring. Both grown into adulthood, with apparently no redeeming values whatsoever who spend the entire book wallowing in anger and self pity. I understand characters don't have to be likeable, but they should have something that enables the reader to connect to or understand their motivations in some way. The only character slightly interesting is the father, who's supposedly going mad. Maybe the author just can't write characters that aren't mentally ill? Although, there is one other character - the daughter's fiance, Ray, who inexplicably loves the little ball of nonsensical rage he's engaged to - who's a decent person, although for some reason it's stated over and over in the book that's he's unintelligent and beneath her, without any examples as to why. Is it a British class thing? The author never has Ray do anything other than be logical, supportive and capable (okay, he does lose his temper once - gasp!), while repeatedly calling out his supposed inferiority to the shitty family at the center of the story. It makes no sense. Another pet peeve. Apparently, the author is a very Angry Atheist. This is his prerogative, but he comes off sounding like an apoplectic Ricky Gervais, painting any and all religious characters with a very broad brush. You get the distinct impression he's never actually met an actual Christian, but is just regurgitating whatever evil schemes he has read about in the Woke news, replete with all the cliches about hating homosexual's ad nauseum. Which then brings me to the sex. For some reason, the gay sex is very explicit, but the straight sex remains in a much more palatable zone. It's an adult book, so to each their own, but I for one am just not that into really graphic sex, straight, gay or otherwise; it's just a personal preference.All in all, this book will definitely not be staying on the shelf; there's absolutely nothing to recommend it to anyone else and I will certainly not be interested in reading another book by this author.

216,4434752914,01/14/2022,3.0,"Like many others impressed by Mark Haddon’s brilliant debut, I picked up his second novel, “A Spot of Bother”—a warm-hearted, entertaining domestic drama set in provincial England and London. It follows a dysfunctional well-to-do family comprising of a recently retired, reticent man in the midst of a mental health crisis, his wife, who is carrying on an affair with his former colleague, and their two adult children—a homosexual man apprehensive of committing to his boyfriend, and a divorced mother who has decided to marry a man her family does not approve of. From the father discovering he might be dying of cancer, to his daughter’s impending backyard nuptials, the story runs through a series of stock sitcom scenarios: Will the affair be discovered? Will the son recognise he loves his boyfriend before it is too late? Will the wedding be called off? Will the father of the bride make peace with his mortality?Despite exploring well-worn themes, the narrative is made interesting by centring the characters’ interiority—through alternating points-of-view—making each of them, especially the protagonist who is suffering a complete breakdown, sympathetic in a way that seems we are really reading about ourselves. But the book is at its most enjoyable in its portrayal of small, ordinary pleasures: snatches of reggae and birdsong drifting from a nearby garden, the sensation of running one’s fingers over the tiny hair on the back of the neck where the barber has run the razor close, or gazing contentedly out of the window while waiting for a lover who is in the shower.Haddon writes in effortlessly light, almost conversational prose, which rarely slips into triviality because it is suffused with wry, subtle observations on everyday anxieties and attitudes. It also helps that it has a generous sprinkling of amusing British idioms. The effective use of parataxis and short paragraphs and chapters keeps the action moving along at a brisk pace. But the writing loses some of its distinctiveness in opting for a farcical and rather shallow denouement. So while fans of “The Curious Incident…” may be let down by its lack of originality, this is nevertheless a charming page-turner.",0,0.9916,0.045,0.793,0.162,0.4983483483483483,POSITIVE,0.9997

I regret that I waited so long to read it, because it's very good. It didn't quite tug at my heart the way that ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time"" did - that book was so poignant, quirky and perfect that I'm still singing it's praises - but it did have the signature heart of that book. It was also really, really funny. I related to every neurotic, weird, lovable character. I loved the relationships between the three main ""couples"" in the book - they were messy, realistic and all, in their own way, had true, unconditional love. Weirdly enough, my favorite scene was when Jamie, who still isn't fully comfortable with being ""out"" to his family, and bereft after recently being dumped because of it, makes the ill-advised choice to bring a man home for the night. Before things can get too hot and heavy, the man gets sick off tainted prawns and runs to the bathroom. While Jamie is trying to ignore the disgusting smells and sounds coming from his bathroom, and after he's cleaned up someone else's vomit, he sets out an array of stomach aids and medicines on the table, where he sits calmly and waits for his guest to return. When the man emerges from the bathroom, Jamie is honestly shocked that he sails out the door rapidly, calling out an apology after him. The author did a really good job of writing Jamie's anxious empath nature, and how one should always be a picture of the good host, regardless of their own inner feelings. Also how lonely Jamie is. It set the tone for the whole book, and the rest of his family's motivations.I can't wait to read more from this author. He has such a beautiful grasp on the odd, frustrating neurosis of life and manages to to lovingly sketch people with anxiety in a way that celebrates their diversity with real humor but true understanding.",0,0.9853,0.117,0.704,0.179,0.6634971293481933,POSITIVE,0.9999
218,2449435743,07/08/2018,2.0,"A Book in BeigeA hop, skip and a jump will take you through this tale of family folk in a state of woe and leave you feeling as vacant as a bucket at the end. One way of getting through it is to concentrate on George, his dreams, manias and self-harming episodes and regard the rest as part of a puppet theatre in which he is somehow, clumsily, pulling the strings. 144 chapters allow the characters to jerk and jolt across fraught domestic space as blood gets tipped around the place, but Haddon's writing works a blunt, overused instrument to bring his marionettes to fictional life. With so many prat-falling episodes, arguments and indecision described with soap-opera slickness, peppered liberally with sloppy cliché everywhere you look, it was a relief to reach the moments of high drama at the end. But Haddon doesn't seem to like his characters, doesn't want to give them time to think their lives through properly (Jamie's the one exception), whilst dreary paragraphs of single compound sentences made me feel I was walking across a vast beige carpet with a few cardboard cut-outs occasionally getting in the way. Opportunities for tense encounters were missed. When Jamie sees the old man with the jaundiced face and throat bandage at the Kenco hospital canteen, nothing is made of it, no reflections, no reasons, just a ghost-grey cameo. The chapter evaporates, like so many, into an abrupt cul de sac. Still, Haddon creates the bittersweets of family life and the daft ceremonies that bring it together quite well, despite the chronic fatigue it induces after the 100th sound bite chapter. The Sunday Telegraph's 'Brilliant. Very Funny' rings hollow against the likes of Jilly Cooper, but the rictus grin that flashes across your face when one of the characters gets his come-uppance at the end (it takes a long, long time coming) might make the smirk muscles wobble a bit.",0,0.5463,0.095,0.806,0.099,0.4537755102040817,NEGATIVE,0.9996
219,1936336672,03/08/2017,2.0,"I read this in college for a class on the modern novel. Here is the reflection I wrote at the time:A Spot of Bother, by Mark Haddon, is a celebration of life, in all of its crazy absurdity. Told amidst shifting perspectives, Haddon’s book recounts a family’s struggle to remain a family in the midst of conflict and frustration. Shifting relationships, changing expectations, and midlife crisises. Gay sons. Headstrong daughters. Insane fathers. Unfaithful wives. All combine to create a mosaic of failure, love, and ultimately, healing and growth. A testimony to the art of living.Haddon’s novel brings to life, in beautiful clarity, the broken nature of humanity and human relationships. But more significantly, it demonstrates the underlying current of hope and redemption that flows beneath the human story. The human journey. The foundation (or what should be the foundation) of every epic tale. The parable of the phoenix. Life rising from the ashes. Grace. The heart of the Christ message. But if truth be told, I like the idea of Haddon’s novel more than its reality. Its themes are powerful. Its execution, less so. I find the plot, though a bit strange, authentic and necessary. The story of primeval panic and fear is one that is rarely told. A taboo topic that is avoided in polite company, and yet is a very real part of living. As George asks at one point, how do people avoid lying down on the floor and screaming? How do they cope? How do we cope? With the darkness. With the knowledge of death. So it is not the unusual plot choices that bother me, so much as the plodding pace. The overlap in story line. Each section, from each perspective, should hold its own weight. Be absolutely necessary to the process of understanding characters and plot. But often they are not. This is especially noticeable towards the end of the book, when the characters congregate at the same point in space, and experience many of the same events. Suddenly the reader is informed of action by multiple narrators. But though the voice changes, the significant information does not, bogging down the story and significantly curbing its speed.Haddon’s tendency to ignore time continuity while shifting narrators is also jarring. It is often difficult (if not impossible) to tell when different events, in different characters’ lives, are taking place. Haddon jumps forward and backward in time (only by a matter of days, but still . . .) while telling simultaneous stories. This causes an odd scramble in my brain. I am also not sure how holistic the novel intends to be. Is this a book about a man who thinks he has cancer, and therefore experiences the derailing of his life? Or is it the story of a life that is unraveling, leading to panic attacks about cancer and death? In other words, which plot factors are connected and which are not? Are these separate stories that interweaving, or one story that has many aspects? How influential is Katie’s marriage, or Jamie’s absence, to George’s cancer? The fluidity of the book left me uncertain. To sum up, I think this book was a powerful attempt. A good idea. However, the story’s recounting would have improved with tighter writing, and stronger plot development. Ultimately, I think this could have been a much shorter book. And as such, a more powerful one. ",0,-0.9799,0.125,0.792,0.083,0.5712994350282486,POSITIVE,0.6806

While I get the desire to have a happy, tidy ending, I feel this plays unnecessarily into the myth that much mental illness can be cured just by thought or willpower alone. It left a bad taste in my mouth, especially after having trodden a good line between demonstrating sympathy for George's problems but not wholesale excusing his poor decisions.

George is your main protagonist, and he has become wary of a bump on his hip that he assumes is cancer. We learn very early on that it is just eczema, but George doesn't quite believe his doctor and slowly goes mad believing that he will soon die.

Everything here comes together in the crazy story of A Spot of Bother. I've previously read the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime, and while I understand that some were disappointed with Haddon's followup, I simply was not. I thoroughly enjoyed Haddon's attempt at creating an entire family each with their own separate issues that were all still someone connected, and I think that, while it may be different from the curious incident, it has something completely different to offer: the story of an entire family. The book was chaotic and hilarious and disastrous, and ridiculous, but it all makes sense in context.

It's very funny, but in a dry and very British way. While George Hall attempts to be quiet about his rapid spiral into insanity, the other members of his family are trying to prove as loudly as possible that they are perfectly sane and have everything under control. The contrast is amusing and heartbreaking at the same time. I also liked that all of the characters were incredibly complex, each having their own issues, inner turmoil, and obstacles to overcome in order to become better people. It was entertaining to see each character believing that they are the good person in the family, when in reality they all have lots of issues that don’t make them better than anyone else. I liked how this novel also shows readers in a philosophical and gripping way how terrifying the idea of dying is. George, like most of us, is aware of the fact that he will die, but isn’t too concerned, until he discovers a lesion on his hip that throws him into a fit of madness. George having to stare the possibility of death in the face causes readers to aware of their own view on death.

THE PEOPLE. None of them were exceptionally bad or evil or sadistic. They were all pretty average. And flawed. So while you didn't exactly dislike them, you didn't really like them either. And that made me feel a little sad. Because in some ways, that's what society can be like. You like the ""appearance"" of someone. But how would you feel about them if you knew all of their flaws? Indeed, how do you feel about yourself KNOWING all of your flaws? Indeed, some of them did rally. And I really wanted them to be happy - or, at least, less unhappy (which was also uncomfortable).

Why oh why once started do I have to see a book through to the bitter ending even if its apparent early on that I'm not enjoying it? It isn't as if I haven't got a mountain of books just begging to be read and yet still I persist in reading books that I'm just not feeling. It's all very well if like the author's first book this wasn't that long but 503 pages!YAWN! Like my last read (Sue Townsend's The Woman Who Went To Bed For A Year) this was another novel about the absurdities of family life; of suburban living, another novel in which a middle aged father has a shed, another novel in which there's infidelity involving a work colleague; an infidelity everyone is OK with (Heck! The 'lover' is even invited to a family wedding in case the adulterer needs emotional support), another novel that as it turns out goes nowhere. AGGGGHHH! Not what I considered a well written novel ... even taking into account that the thesaurus was put to good use if the word 'clearly' being interchanged with 'apparently'/'obviously' was anything to go by.With short (sometimes very short) chapters that all too often felt like they were the outline of a chapter that was yet to be plumped out, that ended on what passed for a cliff-hanger.With too many characters that did not grow (and this despite the fact that just about every chapter saw one or another of them having some kind of life changing epiphany); who felt like they'd been concocted purely as the ends to a means, whose every emotion was registered in that detached, almost dispassionate manner that worked to great effect in The Dog In The Night-Time but here felt insincere. Working class = rough, unintelligent. Christians = no fun at all, homophobic.Just as with Christopher in The Dog In The Night-Time I had my concerns about how some of the characters in A Spot Of Bother were depicted. Referred to in negative language throughout (at one point the author himself uses the word cripple to describe her) it was he portrayal of the disabled wedding guest that really annoyed me.Full of crude sexual language (to say nothing of what might be considered other crude language ... what is it with the author and poo? Poo is mentioned a lot ... an awful lot) that what ... surprised ... shocked me?Such language never sits particularly comfortably with me at the best of times but then it is sometimes in keeping with a character(s). Here however, well!Arguably not something we needed to know ... and, quite frankly, most certainly not something I wanted to know. What I found particularly odd though was that any descriptions seemed to be reserved for sexual body parts/sexual acts ... those we got to know in graphic detail (and boy did we ever) ... any other descriptions were far and few between.A book I'm sure many will have picked up purely on the basis of who wrote it. I wonder how many have come away feeling bitterly disappointed. Then again, each to their own, there are doubtlessly those out there who having not enjoyed Haddon's previous work will have liked this.Copyright ...

I was well aware that there was so relation with his previous work and if I'm completely honest, it has been sat on my shelf for a while because the blurb didnt blow me away. But WOW did Haddon undersell himself! Within a few pages I was hooked and reading it at rate of knots. He continued to prove himself to have an astounding ability to convey a character's internal dialogue, be this an autistic child or a 57 year old man with crippling anxiety. If that isn't scope, I don't know what is. The novel tackles some really serious, poignant themes (anxiety, depression, homophobia, infidelity to name a few) with crackling wit and humour. The typical British stiff upper lip, keep calm and carry on mentality leads to so many miscommunications that it becomes a modern Comedy of Errors.

The prose style is that of a bored child being made to write in class: ""He saw a dog. The dog was barking. Then he realized the dog was barking at him."" The gimmick of the piece is that each chapter switches point of view between the characters, but as they are all equally contemptible and suffer from self-inflicted First World problems recounted in the same vestigial authorial voice, the overall effect is like being stuck in an airport while an annoying family nearby whine at each other. Every so often Haddon can't bear to go on with this level of supermarket trash fiction, and we get a page of the sort of sparkling prose and interesting sensibility that made his collection The Pier Falls so good -- but then the lash of the deadline must have loomed, and he's back to churning it out by the yard.""Dave wasn't enjoying the book.
