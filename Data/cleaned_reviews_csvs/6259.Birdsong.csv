For the dead, over here.""What a beautiful and moving story!Birdsong is a powerful novel, spanning generations and taking us through the horrors of World War 1. Split into mainly 3 sections we begin with Stephen - a young man visiting Amiens in France, staying with a wealthy man and his family, the wife of whom he falls into an illicit love affair with. ""I am driven by a greater force than I can resist. I believe that force has its own reason and it's own morality even if they may never be clear to me while I am alive.""Further down the line we follow Stephen as he is enlisted into the war against Germany. We see both the infantrymen and also the men who work underground, risking being buried alive in order to further their cause. Faulks' writing is truly outstanding, the fear and hopelessness felt by the men is made vivid and terrifyingly portrayed. ""He's frightened that it doesn't make sense, that there is no purpose. He's afraid that he has somehow strayed into the wrong life.""The final section is two generations later, Elizabeth is researching her family history, looking into her ancestors, in particular her grandfather, who left behind notebooks of his experiences. ""I saw the great void in your soul, and you saw mine.""If I could quote this entire book I would. It was powerfully affecting, emotional and profound. 4.5 stars.

2,3181244268,06/27/2020,4.0,"2020 review: A book in seven parts; the first being set in 1910 in France, where a wild affair between a young Stephen Wraysford and his host's wife(!) Isabelle, devastates the families involved, as well as setting the foundations of the book. It then alternates between the lengthy Wraysford 's First World War experiences and the very short sections of his granddaughter seeking to find out his war and post war story.Hey! I was just setting out the book composition, this is a review of sorts, don't ya know! Alongside the fictionalised first-hand descriptions of the harsh reality of trench warfare, there's also depictions of: - a war managed by privileged upper class numbskulls - the tremendous shock of man's inhumane mechanised warfare - a mainstream movie like manipulation of the reader to underline the little regard for life that war has, where key supporting characters' deaths are almost just footnotes, but a footnote with a sniper's bullet or machine gun fire.And it all works! I get it, war is bloody awful; but hey this is a thought provoking way of putting that message across. Like a great mainstream movie, this was perfectly pitched, and in the end all the stories match up, and there's a sense you've just been on a great journey.I was kind of torn, when I first finished this book, I was like... Hell yeah, bring on the Five Stars, but I have to accept that even though the granddaughter's chapters set in the late 1970s are important for the additional story they tell, I just feel that the book would have been better without them. This was also a book that took me nearly 5 months to read, because the intro in Amiens was a bit of a drag for me, young man lusting over hot wife, know what I mean? Overall still a must-read, and a wonderful piece of British fiction, so it's a 9 out of 12, Four Star read.",108,-0.5585,0.15,0.727,0.123,0.5918817204301077,POSITIVE,0.9917
3,301747896,03/27/2012,2.0,"Sebastian Faulks' Birdsong is a kind of Harlequin romance with a literary slant. All the elements for pulp romance are there: ""romantic"" hero: soldier, refined gentleman; unhappy married woman; ""romantic"" locale: French suburbs, countryside; numerous, gratuitous sex scenes (I remember, horrifically, an excess of pulsating ""members"" and curtains of ""flesh""). At the same time, Faulks strives to give it some literary taste, which I believe he largely fails to do. The time-jumping between pre-war, at-war, and present-day seems haphazard, and the present-day revelation of Elizabeth Benson has the dull patina of a celluloid ending (I think of present-day Rose in Titanic, the end of Saving Private Ryan, etc: the cinematic cheat of closing a tragedy by removing it from its era, neglecting the interceding lives of its characters: what I hate about epilogues). It is no surprise that Faulks was commissioned to ghost-write an installment of the James Bond series (Devil May Care). Faulks writes for the cinema, but mostly he writes to the base male fantasies and mock-Hemingway-an masculinity that appeals to contemporary male readers: sex, war, violence, camaraderie and friendship. His attempts at literary effects fail him, and damage the pulpy material beneath. HE is a plot-author with poor plot-pacing: his attempts to bridge past and present-day (a connection which fails to entertain or convince), repeatedly stunt the built up momentum of Stephen and Isabelle's romance, and later on: the gray-violence of the battlefield.I look at the top quotes for Birdsong and find dull pulp and platitudes:
I know. I was there. I saw the great void in your soul, and you saw mine.
Something one might find in a schoolboy's diary. The prose, which is often flabby at the seams, is filled with my short phrases with faked originality and stunted aesthetics: slipshod attempts are juxtaposing and reconciling the ugliness of war and the beauty of passion.
Something had been buried that was not yet dead.
The novel abounds in clich√©: from trite aphoristic turns-of-phrase, to the overall story: very little strikes the reader as truly original or insightful. The Brideshead Revisited-inspired memories are stilted and unnatural, poorly executed. If one is to read this book, one should only read it at the surface, for a war-torn romance: diving in deeper will only reveal the shallowness beneath the surface: the smallness inside of a postured grandness.",99,-0.8783,0.14,0.741,0.118,0.4674418604651162,NEGATIVE,0.9963

While I found the sections on the war proper quite devastating and very well done, I also found the framing device of the pre-war romance and more present day life far less effective and also less well written. My feelings may also be affected to some extent by other World War I literature that I have been reading as part of the Centennial over the past few months.I found that the frame story, actually a dual frame, diminished the war story tremendously. In fact I wondered, prior to the war story beginning, whether I would want to complete reading the book.I've read so many excellent books with the WWI group that did not bother with that kind of tacked on romance, etc. It's simply not necessary. And Faulk certainly demonstrated the skill to write a full book without it. This made me wonder whether he may not have trusted his audience to come to the book. But then I see how many others give this book top ratings and realize that I am out of sync with the majority on this book. But I have no problem with that.

5,73780017,10/07/2009,5.0,"It's as if the author is writing from personal experience. The way that the characters and the atmosphere are built by Sebastian Faulks is just amazing! The reader is taken in to that atmosphere, and shares the feelings of the main character, Stephen. You cannot fail to be totally captivated.Anyone who has served for any significant period in the Armed Forces will instantly relate to the use of black humour to cover the awful reality and horror. Faulks also manages to reflect on how every aspect of life continues, perhaps in the background, as the war goes on. There is a strong and emotive love story. There is a very powerful understanding of the futility of war and its effects on everyone involved, regardless of national allegiance. One of the most poignant parts of the book, for me, is the description of the feelings of the sappers as they tunnel deep below the battlefield, knowing that their counterparts are experiencing the same hopes and fears, only feet away through the awful mud and darkness. Death is never more than a split second away.Note: It makes it even more personal to me as I was in the Royal Engineers (Sappers) during my military career. I'm happy to report, though, that I never had to get involved in the activity of sapping, or tunnelling. Having had the privilege of sitting with Somme veterans, listening to their vivid memories of the trenches and the contacts, and those friends who lost their lives, I can say, with great confidence, that the superb writing of Birdsong takes us as close to being there as is possible.A scene which, some may say, in the greater scheme of the whole book pales into insignificance but is still very well worth mentioning, is the extremely erotic, yet tastefully presented, first sexual encounter between Stephen and Isabelle, which occurs early on in the story. There are other encounters throughout the book, but I found this to be one of the most sexually arousing pieces of writing that I have ever read. It omits just the right amount of detail to allow the reader's imagination to run riot. Amazing!Every emotion is touched during the reading of this book.The title is evocative. I found several reasons to entitle the book this way, not least Stephen's declaration regarding his feelings about birds and the reasons behind those feelings. When you read the book, keep the title in your mind. Seeking the meaning adds an extra dimension to your reading.It is a shame that it is not possible to award six stars to any book that I review, for Birdsong would surely deserve such an award. This one definitely makes it into my lifetime favourite five.I would have no hesitation in recommending Birdsong to absolutely anyone, but most especially to any politician who is thinking about sending young people to their deaths in war.Footnote: I was surprised that The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann featured in Sebastian Faulks's top one hundred books. It sits right at the opposite end of the gripping to boring spectrum of reading to this magnificent work: Birdsong is gripping. ",79,0.8735,0.079,0.817,0.104,0.600866402116402,POSITIVE,0.9996

It did, but the most powerful, thought provoking thing about this book is what happened to the men in the trenches during WW I. The gruesome, gut wrenching realities for soldiers fighting this war are told in phrases so descriptive that you almost wish you hadn't read them - about the smell of blood, wounds and body parts, the claustrophobic, horrific conditions in the tunnels and ultimately what the men lose of themselves .There are friendships and brotherhoods that grow making for some moving and very sad scenes.The novel moves across years - 1910, the war years 1916 ‚Äì 1918, 1978 and 1979. Stephen and Isabelle‚Äôs story came to life in the early parts of the novel, but I found it somewhat difficult to connect with Elizabeth's character as we meet her in 1978.

Yes, it was intense, as any book about a major war out to be. the intensity in this book did not manifest itself only through the gruesomeness the wreckage, and the atrocity associated with the war, but the emotional struggles beneath the surface of ordinary human beings being pulled out of the reality of their otherwise ordinary, though not necessarily perfect lives.It was Stephen‚Äôs story through and through; even with the extension to his granddaughter Elizabeth 60 years ago. Stephen made an entrance to the story as a compulsive and reckless young man barely out of boyhood. The war reshaped him, and at the end we discovered along with Stephen himself, the will to live and the compassion to others that he never had thought he possessed.‚ÄúEscaped from extermination, Stephen feared nothing any more. In the existence he had rejoined, so strange and so removed from what seemed natural, there was only violent death or life to choose between; finer distinctions, such as love, preference or kindness, were redundant.‚ÄùAt a certain point, I was just as fed up with the war as the soldiers in the story.

9,1151306465,01/02/2015,1.0,"warning: this review contains anger, copious swearing, and discussion of rape and misogyny.whenever anyone asks me what my least favourite book is, i always say this, which seems odd considering it's been voted as the 100 best books on a bbc list or whatever it was. usually, when i study a book, my appreciation and enjoyment of it multiplies tenfold. take, for example, the great gatsby, which i had liked previously but became one of my favourite books of all time when i began to study it. now this... thing. i don't understand why it has so much critical acclaim, i don't understand why i'm studying it at A Level, and i don't understand why it's one of the nation's favourite novels. 
i don't understand.
 the novel opens before the war, and stephen has an affair with isabelle. although isabelle does consent, there are some really rapey and misogynistic undertones that make me highly uncomfortable and i have no fucking idea why faulks decided to include them. choice extracts include: ""The force that drove through him could not be stopped. The part of his mind that remained calm accepted this; if the necessity could not be denied, then the question was only whether it could be achieved with her consent."" ""The more she imagined the degradation of her false modesty the more she felt excited.false modesty????? isabelle's initial denial is ""false modesty""?!?!?! i'm going to be sick. oh, and not only are the sex scenes misogynistic as fuck, they're also terribly written. like, honestly, they've practically turned me fully-fledged Gay. ""turning like a key in the split lock of her flesh""ummmm?? ouch?? not to mention how that also has misogynistic undertones tbh of being Unlocked by sex, can faulks Stop. how much do i have to pay to get him to Stopok now the rest. i was completely Bored for the entire novel, and isabelle and stephen's storyline is repeated in elizabeth and whatever the fuck her lover's name is, i can't remember. that is how much i care. now, supposedly this mirroring is supposed to Show The Interconnection Between The Past And Present And Future but to me it just seemed like faulks ran out of fucking ideas. elizabeth is honestly such an irritating character.

10,3027329572,11/06/2019,4.0,"Birdsong is a historical drama about WWI. Whenever I read about the tragedies of war I realize that had I been a soldier I never would have mentally recovered from the atrocities witnessed. Stephen, the main character, does recover but at a great cost. When the book begins Stephen is an impetuous twenty year old. War is not yet in his future. There are a few references to the song of birds and how this sound is annoying to him. This will not always be the case. As we follow Stephen through his horrific war experiences, we realize how he is maturing - not just aging but developing a new humanity. His courage and his desire to survive are vivid and beautifully detailed. The song of birds, once so annoying, becomes the sound of hope and life. What doesn't kill us makes us stronger really applies here. I don't think Stephen's youthful love affair nor his granddaughter's story were nearly as convincing .

""It was not his death that mattered; it was the way the world had been dislocated. It was not all the tens of thousands of deaths that mattered; it was the way they had proved that you could be human yet act in a way that was beyond nature.""
This ‚Äòreview‚Äô might sound like a huge clich√©, and for that I apologise. What I don‚Äôt apologise for is the sentiments behind it because I mean every word.I approached this book, the third time I have read it, with extreme caution. I felt like I was meeting up with friends that I hadn‚Äôt seen for a while. Situations had changed, circumstances had changed and, perhaps most importantly, my reading tastes had changed. Like many people who chose to take English Literature as an A-Level, I was told that I should read this for my War Literature Module. I‚Äôve had bad experience with course books, experiences that started in high school and stretched right up until I graduated university. So I was sceptical to say the least. But Birdsong was different. I truly connected with this book, the story, the writing but, most of all, the characters. So when I decided to re-read it, I was nervous. Would Stephen be as damaged but heroic as I remembered him? Will Weir still make me ache with sadness? Would Jack still make me cry with laughter‚Ä¶ and then overwhelm me with emotion? Will Jeanne still garner my utmost respect? Would Isabelle still make me feel conflicted until the very last page? The answer to all these questions is ‚Äòyes‚Äô. There are four parts in this book that I will always remember. And I know people who are reading this will be like‚Ä¶ woah spoilers, but that‚Äôs the thing. If you know anything about the war, whether it‚Äôs due to an interest in history, you‚Äôve read books, you‚Äôve listened to your grandparent‚Äôs talking about it‚Ä¶ you know that this actually happened.I wish there was a spoiler tag for history but, unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt. (But if you want to know nothing about this book‚Ä¶ please skip this next part.)The first is the part where Stephen is reading the letters in the trenches. This bit is so raw with emotion that my heart physically ached. The letter that I seem to have remembered most vividly is Tipper‚Äôs, a relatively minor character. At first you might think that him writing things such as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrific show‚Äù and ‚ÄúOur guns are putting on a display like Firework Night. We are going to attack and we can‚Äôt wait to let Fritz have it‚Äù is down to youthful enthusiasm and ignorance. He‚Äôs new to the war and he‚Äôs never been over the top before, so he doesn‚Äôt know what to expect. But really these frivolous words are because he‚Äôs afraid but doesn‚Äôt want his parents, who are seeing the war through the newspapers alone, to know the truth.The second scene is Weir‚Äôs visit back home. His father‚Äôs conversation with him, dismissing his son‚Äôs cry for help because he knows, was unfortunately something that happened often. And not just on the British side, in All Quiet on the Western Front there is a particularly poignant scene where Paul visits home and realises that everything has stayed the same, but completely incomprehensible to someone who has seen what he has seen. The third part is where the soldiers are require to venture back into No Man‚Äôs Land and collect the bodies of their dead. This scene, which is difficult to stomach seeing as Faulk‚Äôs can perfectly describe the state of a body who has been left to the elements for two weeks, was unbearably haunting. My heart bled, and continues to bleed, for Brennan. And the fourth was the one of the last scenes with Stephen in the mines. With the aid of Faulks‚Äô writing, I could feel the hammering of Stephen‚Äôs heart, his desperation, his hope fading, his desire to live and the grime beneath my finger nails. What I love the most about this book and perhaps why I‚Äôve read it so many times and will continue to read it again and again is how Mr Faulks portrays the human spirit when humanity has been completely deserted. Birdsong is a shocking book and there are many passages that made me feel sick to my stomach, angry and so sad that I had to actually stop reading and do something else for a while. It is difficult to read this book and not get immersed in it.Yes, you might get bored with the love story (and don‚Äôt forget that shocking and explicit part where people have sex! Shock, horror) and yes you might get a bit bored with Elizabeth‚Äôs story line (I actually love that bit‚Ä¶ I find it extremely honest and realistic), but there is no denying that the parts in the trenches with Stephen, Weir, Firebrace and the rest of the men are nothing short of astounding.

Think of those stinking towns and foul bloody villages whose names will be turned into some bogus glory by fat-arsed historians who have sat in London. We were there. As our punishment for God knows what, we were there, and our men died in each of those disgusting places. I hate their names. I hate the sound of them and the thought of them, which is why I will not bring myself to remind you.  Wow! First published in 1994, Birdsong is a WWI era novel that spans 1910-1979 and focuses on main protagonist, Stephen Wraysford, a young Englishman that begins a sordid affair with a French businessmen's wife, Madame Azaire. The two are separated and years laters Stephen is now serving in the British army in France. In the 1970's timeline, a young woman named Elizabeth is becoming increasingly interested in a series of notebooks that she has found in her mother's attic and they may just have the key to some untold family secrets left over from the war.Many times I have lain down and I have longed for death. I feel unworthy. I feel guilty because I have survived. Death will not come and I am cast adrift in a perpetual present. I do not know what I have done to live in this existence. I do not know what any of us did to tilt the world into the unnatural orbit. We came here for only a few months. No child or future generation will ever know what this was like. They will never understand.  When it is over we will go quietly among the living and we will not tell them.We will talk and sleep and go about our buisness like human beings. We will seal what we have seen in the silence of our hearts and no words will reach us. Sebastien Faulks won my heart with his WWII espionage book, Charlotte Gray. Well, right until that ending that left me scratching my head. But Birdsong truly moved me and is quite simply- an AMAZING book. It is less the romance, but Stephen's time on the frontlines and his time with his men that was truly the gem of the book.  No one in England knows what this is like. If they could see the way these men live they would not believe their eyes. This is not a war, this is an exploration of how far men can be degraded.

16,282544941,07/21/2019,4.0,"How much do you know about World War I? If you're like me, very little. In his introduction to Birdsong, Sebastian Faulks explains that World War II came along so quickly, that the preceding conflict was kind of overlooked in literature, and not as much was written about it. Well he certainly did his best to address that gap with the masterful Birdsong.We begin in 1910. Stephen Wraysford, a 20-year-old Englishman, travels to Amiens on business. He falls head over heels for Isabelle, an older woman, who leaves her husband and stepchildren to begin a new life with her lover. Eventually, she becomes overwhelmed with guilt and returns to her family, leaving Stephen crushed. Six years later, he is back in the same region, now a Lieutenant in the British forces preparing for the Battle of the Somme. In the face of absolute horror and probable death, he does not allow himself to think about love, or what life after this conflict could even look like. But he just might end up seeing Isabelle again, and perhaps there is more to their story than he knows.The romance is one of the reasons Birdsong works so well. The passion in Stephen and Isabelle's relationship is so electric - the snatched, illicit moments of their affair, the excitement of their elopement, the possibilities that lay ahead. And of course, its demise is devastating. All of Stephen's army colleagues have somebody they want to return home to, a face they desperately want to see again that gives them a reason to survive. He tells himself that he doesn't have anyone like this, that he never did. But deep down, he knows that's not true.However, the crowning achievement of Birdsong is its unflinching depiction of war. The earsplitting cacophony of the artillery, the claustrophobia of the tunnels, the never-ending mud, the smell of sweat and shit, the horror of seeing a head explode in front of your eyes. The heartbreaking letters sent home from the Somme, its writers knowing that they were almost certainly going to die in the coming hours. The bodies in pieces, pale and rotting in no man's land. The senseless brutality of it all, summed up by a roll call after the battle, ringing with unanswered names: 
""Names came pattering into the dusk, bodying out the places of their forebears, the villages and towns where the telegrams would be delivered, the houses where the blinds would be drawn, where low moans would come in the afternoon behind closed doors; and the places that had borne them, which would be like nunneries, like dead towns without their life or purpose, without young men at the factories or in the fields, with no husbands for the women, no deep sound of voices in the inns, with the children who would have been born, who would have grown and worked or painted, even governed, left ungenerated in their fathers' shattered flesh that lay in stinking shellholes in the beet crop soil, leaving their homes to put up only granite slabs in place of living flesh, on whose inhuman surface the moss and lichen would cast their crawling green indifference.""
I came very close to awarding this novel the full five stars, but I did find it a little bit drawn-out at times, especially in the final chapters. This is a small complaint (and maybe I am too hard to please!). For at its best, Birdsong is a stunning feat - tense, powerful and unbearably moving. It's the kind of book you want to press into the hands of world leaders before they embark on some unnecessary, avoidable war.

The part about THE war, I have to admit I had very little knowledge of WWI before I read this book, except for the bare minimum of how it started and how a great many young men died in the war. I also don't normally read books with many battle scenes and with war as the main theme, but once I started reading this one, I just couldn't put it down until I reached the last page. What moved me most was the detailed description of the tension in the anticipation of the attacks(i.e., Battle of the Somme), the horror of being trapped in tunnels thirty feet underground in no man's land, and the psychological effect of the sheer brutality of the war on the soldiers, which were unimaginable and devastating to say the least. I was on the verge of tears a few times! The last chapter about the war was this truly remarkable story of endurance, bravery, survival and humanity that would bring you down to your knees. I also found the parts about tunnel digging very interesting to read as well, believe it or not. It gives you a good sense of how part of the war was fought on both sides. The part about love was also very well done. Now I see why Faulks was commissioned to write Devil May Care as Ian Fleming. Some passages in the first part of the novel were so sensual that I almost couldn't believe a man actually wrote it. ",30,-0.9664,0.203,0.64,0.157,0.4526819923371648,POSITIVE,1.0

It was fated for me to read this book (at least I believe it to be so) since as I walked into the library, this book was propped up on the shelf seeming to send a message saying take me home. I listened and am ever so grateful I did take this powerful book home and to heart.My grandfather (age sixteen) fought in the Argonne forrest and was gassed in WW 1. He was in the trenches and as I read I pictured him there among the rats, the mud, the awfulness of war. Perhaps this connection made the book not just another book about a war, but one that held memories for me of a beloved man who was just a kid fighting a onerous war.Stephen, our protagonist was the ultimate soldier, not because he wanted to be, but because his humaneness made him so. He endeavored to remain, while carrying on a torrid affair with a married woman, aloof and separate all his feelings that he had buried so long. He was an orphan in more than the physical sense as he tries to understand himself and the turmoil of emotions, and the heinousness of war. Reading this book and knowing the conditions under which these young men lived and died was a nightmare come true. Is it any wonder that these boys, at least the ones who managed to get through the war as Stephen did, were left indelibly marked by tragedy, grief, and the smell of death. Oftentimes, it got to the point in my reading where I felt I just could not go on, and yet I could not stop. I was in a extremely small way like the soldiers forced to look at things deadly unpleasant and vile.The book was utterly mesmerizing in its portrayal of Stephen and all the things that ultimately made him what he later would be. He was a broken man, as I am sure all those young boys who survived were. Yet, survive he did almost as if fated to do so. With so much carnage surrounding them, I am sure oftentimes even in survival, they wished to be among the dead.The writing and story, so powerfully told were only slightly marred by the woman, Isabelle, Stephen's love. She eventually, at least to me, became an intrusion in the story. I also, did feel that the granddaughter's part did not enhance the story as well.All in all, this was Stephen's story and one that all should hear no matter how many years have passed since The Great War. When you think of courage, of determination, of the best that men can be in a situation where there is nothing but death and decay, you will think of Stephen's story.

The standout part of the whole novel is Wraysford's time in the trenches during the Great War. I have never read a book that has ever given me a clearer idea of what this battlefield was like, and the horrors that these men lived through and then carried with them. It is some of the most powerful writing I have seen, and the chilling coldness with which Wraysford treats all this is really evocative. He has seen it and lived with it for so long, tempered by a lost love, that he merely lingers, waiting for the inevitable. The final third, in which one of Wraysford's descendants enacts an oddysey into her lineage is not so well done. I can understand the intentions, but it just falls wide of the mark, and was in the end so ineffectual as to become almost redundant.

20,275673382,02/10/2012,2.0,"I waver between two or three stars for this book. The writing is serviceable, but often terminally pedestrian, and occasionally clumsy (‚ÄúStephen lifted searching eyes above the soup spoon as he sucked the liquid over his teeth‚Äù). The plotting is similarly ham-fisted, with its tepid ‚Äúromances‚Äù, and unaffecting, though undoubtedly well-researched war scenes (‚ÄúStephen watched the men go on madly, stepping over the bodies of their friends, clearing one firebay at a time, jostling one another to be first to traverse. They had dead brothers and friends on their minds; they were galvanized beyond fear. They were killing with pleasure. They were not normal‚Äù). It‚Äôs as though Faulks had decided that, after dutifully wading through volumes of war correspondences and field reports, he would create certain characters representative of the era and then assign random period characteristics to them. They remain as shallow as a soldier‚Äôs hasty grave, and thus their historically accurate gory deaths are devoid of pathos. But the turning point for me was the totally extraneous subplot involving Elizabeth, Stephen‚Äôs granddaughter, and the eye-rollingly unbelievable climax of her story. In her late thirties, involved in an unpromising affair with an older married man, Elizabeth develops a sudden interest in her grandfather‚Äôs war diaries and discovers facts about her family‚Äôs past --- in a particularly slow-witted way:‚ÄúElizabeth did some calculations on a piece of paper, Grand-mere born 1878. Mum born‚Ä¶she was not sure exactly how old her mother was. Between sixty-five and seventy. Me born 1940. Something did not quite add up in her calculations, though it was possibly her arithmetic that was to blame.‚ÄùUmm --- my nine-year old knows how old I am. Elizabeth was raised by her mother, Francoise, and is the managing director of her company. There is no indication whatsoever that her mother wants to keep any family history secret. The implication is that they are curiously dull, or so bovinely indifferent, that such basic facts simply never came up in their family life. Or perhaps, her abject ignorance is a clunky plot device.Whatever. By this point, I‚Äôm plodding through the story like a WW I soldier through waist-high muck. But wait, Elizabeth is also historically challenged:Francoise: ‚ÄúI was sent to Jeanne from Germany, where I had been living, because my real mother had died. She died of flu.‚ÄùElizabeth: ‚ÄúOf flu? That‚Äôs impossible.‚ÄùFrancoise:	‚ÄúNo. There was an epidemic. It killed millions of people in Europe just after the end of the war.‚ÄùEr, Elizabeth --- how did you get past high school?Elizabeth and her married lover proceed to ‚Äúcreate an autonomous human life from nothing‚Äù, and this is unequivocally portrayed as something gloriously life-affirming. Somehow, Stephen‚Äôs wartime heroism inspired her to conquer her impending mid-life/ biological clock crisis by procreating. Screw the wife and kids. They‚Äôre obliviously happy.

Not because they don‚Äôt interest me, but because they‚Äôre just too horrific for me to deal with most of the time. Zombies, ghosts, vampires, demons ‚Äì bring em‚Äô on! I‚Äôve got nerves of steel. But young men and women, meeting across battlefields to slaughter each other by the thousands? That‚Äôs where the real horror lies. How could my own species be so coldly violent? So utterly nonchalant about the wholesale murder of children? So sadistically creative in our methods? And worse ‚Äì I feel like many books and films tend to glorify this horror.But this book never ever does that. This is one of the most exposed, gruesome, and honest portrayals of warfare that I‚Äôve ever experienced. Nothing is left out ‚Äì the filth, the lice, the claustrophobic trenches, the madness, the isolation, the lies. Faulks doesn‚Äôt spare the reader from any atrocity. Every horror is described with frank, almost clinical prose. He doesn‚Äôt exaggerate or rely on melodrama, and that almost makes everything worse. His lack of emotion penetrated my defenses more than dramatics ever could.This story is broken up over three different time periods. In the first, Stephen Wraysford is a young and passionate Englishman who is in France on business. There, he falls in love and begins an affair with a married woman. In the second time period, Stephen is a much sobered and aged leader of a platoon of infantrymen in the First World War. In the third, a middle aged woman in the 1970‚Äôs seeks information about her ancestors.The portions of the story that take place during World War One are extraordinary. Faulks perfectly captures the conditions and mindset of the soldiers. He breathes such isolation into his characters ‚Äì as each little bit of humanity is snuffed out and hardened, they become further disconnected from their former lives. And yet, there are the little inconvenient shreds of compassion, decency, and innocence that tend to reassert themselves with each new trauma. And there‚Äôs something else that happens in the trenches ‚Äì a brotherhood of fellow survivors. These men, so completely separated from the rest of humanity, manage to find some kind of closeness with each other ‚Äì the only people alive who could possibly understand.So why didn‚Äôt I give this book five stars? Well, I simply didn‚Äôt enjoy the other segments even half as much as the parts during World War One. The romance is cheesy (although, ends on a note made me enjoy it a bit more in hindsight). The portions in the 70‚Äôs are slow and a bit boring. Where Faulks‚Äô prose works so well with horrific warfare, it renders the day to day with too much simplicity and dullness. I also didn‚Äôt find much to relate to with any of the female characters, who all feel one-dimensional.However, this book is very much worth reading. If you are looking for a vivid and uncompromising portrayal of trench warfare, you can do no better.Perfect Musical PairingWhen They Asked UsThis is one of the many ‚Äútrench songs‚Äù from the English soldiers in WW1.And when they asked us,How dangerous it was.Oh! We'll never tell them,No, we'll never tell them.The lyrics, for me, speak to the complete separation of an entire generation of young men from their families. It is impossible to describe years of sustained horror and trauma, and I think that this is a darkly humorous nod to that impossibility.

It is now up to us to keep alive the memories of those who have endured the war and of those who have not. It is up to us to remember. It is up to us to keep history from repeating itself.""Birdsong"" by Sebastian Faulks was my personal choice to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I. The book follows the life of a young Briton Stephen, whom we meet in France, first on a work mission, and years later on a totally different mission in the midst of WWI. The book jumps back and forth in time, taking us to late 70‚Äôs as well, where we meet Stephen‚Äôs granddaughter Elizabeth in her late thirties. Never having known her grandfather, who had died before she was born, she decides to learn as much as possible about him and goes on a strange quest in search of the lost memories. Although I had mixed feelings about the book, the main reason being my inability to connect emotionally to its characters, I think that it definitely fulfilled the mission I assigned to it. It taught me things about WWI I was not aware about, even though historical fiction and wars were receiving a lot of my attention lately. It made me look for more information about the war and convinced me at the same time that France deserves another visit of mine, this time to places such as Thiepval or Amiens. It also made me ask myself if normality can ever be restored after one has experienced a war. ‚ÄúIt was not his death that mattered; it was the way the world had been dislocated.

The night poured down in waves from the ridge above them and the guns at last fell silent. The earth began to move. To their right a man who had lain still since the first attack, eased himself upright, then fell again when his damaged leg would not take his weight. Other single men moved, and began to come up like worms from their shellholes, limping, crawling, dragging themselves out. Within minutes the hillside was seething with the movement of the wounded as they attempted to get themselves back to their line... It was like a resurrection in a cemetery twelve miles long. Bent, agonized shapes loomed in multitudes on the churned earth, limping and dragging back to reclaim their life.

Someone should have known I am acutely claustrophobic and that opening the door to this book would be inviting in the specter of a panic attack. Picture me curled on the sofa or huddled beneath the covers, my breath shallow, my heart racing, my throat closing as soldiers worm their way through tunnels beneath the trenches. Feel the numbing of my extremities, the draining of blood from my face, the hot rush of acid in my belly, the rise of bile in my throat as those tunnel walls begin to cave and threaten to trap those young men in a tomb made of French dirt. Even now my hands shake with the memory of some of this novel's most horrific scenes. For I couldn't stop reading, I couldn't look away, even through my tears and hyperventilation, I read on. So, consider yourself warned. This book contains the stuff of nightmares. And it's not just the dreadful tunnels, it is the unrelenting, unfathomable misery of the World War I battlefields. What is it about this war? All war is hideous, but there is something about this war-the number of casualties, the waves and waves of young men released onto the battlefields as cannon fodder, the squalor of the trenches, the chemicals-it was a war that obliterated a generation. Many of those who survived became empty shells, having left their hope and their souls and in some cases, their minds, to the battlefields of the Somme, Passchendaele, Verdun, Ypres. Birdsong owns the war, it lives and breathes in those trenches. Your skin will crawl with lice, you will feel the slip and muck of blood and brains underneath your boots; hell, you'll feel your toes crumbling with trenchfoot inside your rotting boots. You will cry out in horror as a soldier whose name you've just learned, whose two or three paragraphs will have you aching for his girl and his parents back in Surrey, dissolves in a cloud of flesh and bone beside you. Yes, you have been warned. This is not an easy read. But Birdsong is more than a black, white, red reel of warfare. It begins as a love story between an odd and doomed French woman, Isabelle Azaire and a very young and impassioned Englishman, Stephen Wraysford. Their adulterous affair in Isabelle's home in Amiens six years before the war opens Birdsong. Part One, the first one hundred-odd pages-is an unsettling combination of tedium and floridity as Stephen and Isabelle tear off their clothes and Edwardian sensibilities under the noses of Isabelle's husband and two stepchildren. The affair ends but their story carries on, surfacing many years later as the war tears into homes, flesh and families. It is Stephen whom we follow throughout the story, he who carries us onto the battlefield, into the trenches and down those dreadful tunnels. Halfway through the story we jump to 1978, where Elizabeth Benson has taken a sudden interest in her grandfather, Stephen Wraysford and the fate of the men who died in or limped home from the trenches of World War I. Here the narrative stumbles a bit. Elizabeth, now in her late 30s, seems entirely unaware of the horrors of The Great War. This rang utterly false. ""No one told me,"" she says upon seeing the battlefields and monuments of the Somme. I think a British citizen of her generation would have been well aware of the magnitude of that war. But Faulks gives Elizabeth a strong voice and her own personal dilemmas that bring the existential quest for meaning and truth full circle. We don't stay in late 70s London for long, but we dip in and out until the novel's end as Elizabeth's story becomes woven into her grandfather's.Sebastian Faulk's writing is sumptuous and pitch perfect, capturing the essence of each of the three eras he writes--the tumescent melodrama that unfolds in Amiens in 1910, the desperation, emptiness and incongruous vividness of the war years, and the practical, surging energy and wealth of late 70s London. This is a great novel, an engrossing but devastating read. Just look up every so often and take deep, slow breaths.

I loved all the emotion - horror of war and passionate love. And great lines and so much to think about...... Can I collect my thoughts?! This book has everything. It is exciting and horribly moving and oh so wonderful. It is like life: full of the worst and most wonderful. There are lines you must ponder. Why does one fight in a war? Who do we fight for? Do you fight for your land, your family, your friends....or for those comrades who have fought and died next to you? You are in the trenches and in tunnels, in the middle of bombardments. You are in a tunnel and you may be suffocated and buried alive. This book is about fear. This book is about the warfare of WW1.But there is humor and passionate love too. Their is death and there is birth. There is hope and despair. The story takes place during WW1 in the trenches in France. It also has events set later, in the 70s. Most authors cannot switch between different time periods. In this book the two are wonderfully intertwined. This book rips you apart, scares you to death, rolls you in passionate, sensual love, one minute has you giggling and then later pondering the essence of life and death and fear. The book is an emotional roller coaster. And you will learn what it was really like to fight in the first world war.

That person has never been more correct in their life. Faulks has created a poignant and epic love story, set in the absolute atrocities of the first world war. The scenes in the trenches are truly horrific and they tell the reader the very depths of human despair. I had to pause after a couple of these such scenes, just to let what I had just read, sink in. This book contains probably the most raw accounts of war, that I have ever read. This is beautifully and skillfully balanced out with a romantic story, which I didn't think I would love as much as I have. The last sixty pages of this book were exhausting, tense, and to be honest, I found I was not dry eyed by the time I'd finished. I just didn't want this book to finish. My poor heart is literally aching, and I most definitely need to rest it. Five stars is simply not enough for this literary masterpiece.",16,0.6674,0.144,0.701,0.155,0.529708222811671,NEGATIVE,0.9815
31,380135501,07/30/2012,5.0,"This is a masterful novel with lasting resonance for me about the impacts of war and resilience of human spirit. I think its achievement be at a level of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". The narrative covers the life of an English man in France before the World War 1, his four years as a soldier, and a search by his granddaughter 60 years for knowledge of his life. It's hard for the reader to care about Stephen Wraysford in the first section. He is aloof and unemotional, with no family or religion, and he has little ambition in his work as a liaison between a textile company in England and in rural Amiens, the area of the Battle of the Somme. But a passionate love affair with a married woman begins to awaken his humanity. Faulks finds in him a suitable vehicle to portray a kind of man who could survive and do well as a soldier in the face of the devastations and vacuum of purpose in this war. He becomes a lieutenant assigned to support the efforts of a tunneling crew tasked with digging under the German lines and setting off explosions. The contrasts between the horrors of trench warfare and the alternative hell underground, make for powerful reading despite the unemotional tone of its rendering. A war like this should make our civilization become more human somehow in response; Stephen seems to represent a miraculous example of that on an individual level. Over time Stephen comes to care about the men he fights with and develops a form of love with two in particular, a captain of a sapper platoon and a middle aged ""tunnel rat"". In a foreward to the 2004 edition, Faulks notes: ""Michael Weir and Jack Firebrace provided harmonic lines in counterpoint to Stephen's: innocence when he is worldly, scared where he is cold, despondent while he remains questing."" Firebrace is driven to return to his family, whereas Weir, Stephen figures: ""tries to believe his survival is worth something to fight for. Something to die for, you might almost say. He's not afraid of gas or shells or being buried. He's frightened that it doesn't make sense, that there is no purpose. He's afraid that he has somehow strayed into the wrong life."" As Stephen struggles with his nihilism, a near death experience shakes him up. His comes to let loose of the pain of his lost love from before the war: ""He told himself that the feeling that they had for each other still existed, but that it existed in a different time.""; he is able to nurture a relationship with the woman's sister, which motivates his will to survive. Decades later, his granddaughter Elizabeth unearths some of Stephen's story, rendering a perspective from a ""normal"" life. Faulks explains in his preface how he used her in order that: ""he past and the present, the public and private, be shown to be vitally interdependent gestures of love and redemption towards the past"".",15,-0.7003,0.097,0.824,0.079,0.4163600891861762,POSITIVE,0.9969
32,1889306475,02/20/2017,3.0,"I do like a proper war book, where the soldiers are real men and not action heroes. However, any war story must be measured against ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" and few can match up.This book starts with a romance in France in 1910, which is a nice idea as it grounds the protagonist before we see him again in the trenches. The romance takes up 100 pages, or a quarter of the book, and was a bit long for me. Then the romance ends and I never understood why, nor did the protagonist.The war stuff is all very real and the author tries very hard to understand war. which is quite difficult since it is such a ridiculous concept. ie: The protagonist is interested to see what will happen, and wonders, as we all do, how so many men can be persuaded to kill each other for so long. By that he means, you might be able to stir young men up with thoughts of conquest or of protecting your own country, but once the initial hysteria is over, how do you keep it going? When all a soldier can see is that himself and his friends are risking their lives and dying horribly every day, what does it take to stop fighting? The answer is that they don't. Each new horror is faced and overcome and people adapt to the hell and keep on fighting. The author isn't referring to individuals refusing to fight, they would simply be shot; but if both armies just stopped, there is nothing the politicians, Kaisers, Kings or Queens could do.The protagonist is an interesting character and his story in the trenches is well worth reading. In summary, it was a bit overlong and repetitive. The jump forward to 1978 was unnecessary and quite dull.",16,-0.9878,0.178,0.742,0.08,0.4729729437229437,NEGATIVE,0.9999

34,1054467078,09/14/2014,4.0,"I recommend reading 'Birdsong', but it will not suit some readers, particularly since it is what felt to me three different books. One book is a Romance. The other is a gritty World War I genre. I found the first third of the novel tedious, a two-star grade at best. But most of the rest of of the book is five star, no reservations at all.It consists of seven parts: 1910 France, 1978 England, 1917 France, 1978 England, 1918 France, 1979 England. It follows Stephen Wraysford and Elizabeth Benson - Wraysford in 1910-1918, Benson in 1978.First, the awful Romance section!It opens with a hot and heavy graphic soft-porn section, which might cause PG-13 Romance readers offense. The author dares to reveal the idea physical sex between adults involves genitals (graphically described). Some literary readers (like me) might feel the dialogue is terrible stuff in this section, being unrealistic, exaggerated for dramatic effect, and too quickly intimate and candidly revealing for a developing love affair in an era of drawing room manners. It was a bit like, ""Hi, I'm Isabelle Azaire. My husband is a boring lover and he is an old man of 40 that looks 50 with an aging body, but he is turning mean because he has decided our sex life is my fault and I'm bored with my life because I'm only 27 and although I love his children from a previous marriage it's not enough. Want a cup of tea?"" ""Hello, I'm Stephen Wraysford and I'm an 20-year-old impoverished ex-con with no education, skills, family or money. Want to run away with me? I know you are the one from the first second of meeting you. I'll love you forever."" ""How thrilling! You are the hottest thing in bed I've ever had! Let's go!"" Although the writing about how Stephen and Isabelle relate to each other is pure soap opera stupid, the rest of '1910' is beautifully written. The Azaire family and their best friends are vividly drawn. Wraysford's innocence and passion are established, as well as the fact he is an honorable, normal youth whose indiscretions are based on his poverty and parentless upbringing. (view spoiler)[ The character Isabelle is an idiot and a shallow jerk, one of those who thinks her feelings in love are first over every other consideration. She is stimulated by affection only when the 'love' is considered outlaw. It's all about 'Romance' to her, and she never does consider how quickly romance fades, or that the problem might be her. Of course, any intelligence she possessed would not have been appreciated anyway given the turn-of-the-century times and what was expected of her by her middle-class parents and husband. This section of the book is a world of duty and conformity. Isabelle is a shallow person who cannot think outside of her limitations, other than a taste for sex and change. She reminds me of a lower class Mary, Queen of Scots, at least how that Queen has been portrayed in movies. But she is the vision which sears itself on Wraysford's consciousness. Later, she appears to become a little more of a substantial person, but not much, since WWI cuts her life short. (hide spoiler)]Stephen was definitely in lust with Isabelle, and he may even have been in love, fantasy driven as it was. (Men are much more basic when young - want eat now, want sleep now, want fast car now, want sex now... - ; ) If you satisfy their basic needs they will fall in actual love. For awhile.) His serendipitous love is a fortunate thing because this incident in his life sustains him through what may arguably be the worst modern war of the Western world, even understanding that every war is full of unspeakable horrors.Still with me? Sorry if that seemed harsh. Some of us turn sour after a lifetime of disappointments in human nature. Nineteen seventy-eight introduces us to a relative of the people we've been reading about in 1910, Elizabeth Benson. She is a modern woman of London. Elizabeth has a mild desire for marriage because she would like to have kids. But she wavers at losing her independence. She has a great job and can support herself, which is possible because society no longer forces women to stay home. Her boyfriend is married with children and works in another country. A series of circumstances leads her to research WWI and her grandfather's service in France. She is almost completely unaware of the nature of war, but especially WWI is unknown to her. Her research becomes more determined as she realizes what an amazing thing it is what ordinary young men and boys went through in serving as soldiers in a war. Many men never talk about it. War costs them in shortened lives and broken relationships, mostly unrecognized, unrewarded and forgotten.Then, finally, the section which is the literary novel, begins. It is a horrific World War I book.If you wish to experience as vivid and realistic of a war as if you were there, in the trenches of WWI in this case, author Sebastian Faulks could not make it happen any more real than he does in this novel unless he hooked up a virtual reality chip directly into your brain. Parts 1917/1918 are the most fantastic war writing I've ever read. It's incredibly awful and incredibly beautiful. The suffering, starving, lice and filth, the miles of walking and lack of sleep on poor quality food and very little water, the heat, the noise, the shocking deaths of friends inches from you, the blood and body parts - I was there with the character. It seemingly has no end, and it really does continue for years and years. The pay is lousy and any second you could die. Yet despite the continuous fear and stress, your brain must somehow be alert enough to do your job, when mostly all you want is to become dead without the pain. However, there is glory in knowing your fellow soldiers, their willing sacrifices for you. There is the inexplicable bravery which is pulled out of you, as well as the amazing strengths you find you have in wanting to live when you had wanted to die a second before. It's all alive and real in this part of the novel, as if you were Wraysford. He was not a fictional character while I read this. I was in his head, feeling his life. War can add depth to a participant's understanding, or it can freeze everything in amber, like stopping time. A war veteran might remain a permanent 18-year old emotionally even when they are 50 years old. It can wipe out almost all emotion within a person, leaving behind only depression, misplaced rage and bad memories which overlay their lives forever. It can cause a permanent emotional numbing, a complete inability to enjoy or anticipate good things in the future. As psychology is well understood by the average Western citizen today, I know I don't need to really describe these responses to you. However, the why  war survivors have these problems we civilians usually tiptoe around, not wanting to explore whatever horrors caused a person's PTSD. This is not a lack of empathy or curiosity, this is self-preservation. Once war is fully experienced, whether in actual fact or only vicariously, it reduces the level of joy one can feel. Never again will the lightness of being that most children are born with will still be felt.Whew! I will not be forgetting this part of the book.If ‚ÄòBirdsong‚Äô consisted of the 1917-1918 sections alone, I would be jumping up and down, thrusting this novel into the hands of all my friends pleading with them to read this next, please. But it had the unconvincing section of Isabelle's and Stephen's affair, which frankly, had me almost abandoning the book. Benson's sections were better, but I felt her section was unnecessary to the story. In my opinion, I think this was a Great War Novel originally. But maybe somewhere a decision was made to add a doomed love affair to maybe contrast one form of Romance with others. Since the added-in love affair section was very bad, and the genealogical search by a granddaughter seemed peripheral and tacked in, I felt as if I were reading a clone of lesser dimensions similar to previous literary books with the same literary elements, but with today‚Äôs social values.In re-reading the above paragraph, I think I am being too mean, gentle reader. So judgemental. Excuse me. My id crawls out and roars sometimes. She is rather black and white and vicious in her thinking. I‚Äôll push her back down now.The title Birdsong is very cool and very likely full of meaning. Actual birdsong is a delight to hear, sometimes achingly so. It can induce the same feelings that hearing a distant train can. I had fun when I finished the novel, and after I dried my tears after the last page of the war section, trying to figure out why this awful romance/gorgeous war novel had been given this title. Feel free to offer suggestions.(view spoiler)[If Isabelle is supposed to be symbolically a lovebird, then I'd say she would strictly represent the 'song' - ephemeral. The feelings she engenders in the listener is she is all about her. Perhaps she does honestly feel the music she's singing - for a second. Who knows what singers are actually feeling? The person hearing a song can easily mistake his own roused emotions as belonging to the singer. Singers can sing lovely songs, but that doesn't mean the song reflects the singer's real state. I guess WAR can be represented by a birdsong, too. Governments can make war seem ennobling and worthy, using the birdsong of marching music, drums and shiny uniforms, promising a chance to test yourself and experience killing someone, all for justice and righteous vengeance. Birdsong can be a warm lap or a harsh fist. It's a dream-inducing sound, a concept, not an actuality, not something to hold in your hand, however pretty or evocative, or grating. The song is not the bird, staring at you, maybe thinking about a taking a crap. (hide spoiler)]""Wilt thou be gone?

Faulks did a shatteringly good job of conveying the sheer incomprehensible horror of the trenches and mines. He was equally adept at blind, headlong, addictive physical passion. What kept this novel from five stars was the 1978-1979 material about Elizabeth Benson. While the snippet of her at Thiepval is moving, I get no sense of promises kept or the torch being passed from her life, pregnancy and delivery. I'm not even sure a device to connect past and present generations is necessary.BBC did a very good radio dramatization of this in 1997 featuring Toby Stephens as Stephen Wraysford.

Starting in pre-war France and moving on in time, it deals with Stephen's experiences in love and war. It begins in 1910 when Steven discovers his first love. It's not so much love, however, more a young man's lust idealized as love. And, that, sadly, was to be interrupted by war. It will provide much necessary yearning for the young Steven who goes off to that terrible war.The battlefield scenes are very descriptive, making difficult reading at times, as the reader is engulfed in the trenches and tunnels as if witnessing the carnage and the brutalities of War first hand. Stephen loses more and more of his innocence and humanity, and looks upon death as expected rather than feared. As his humanity diminishes in the face of the horridness of battle and the claustrophobia of the tunnels he finally experiences a resurgence of the will to live. Life, however, will be far different than what he imagined before the war to end all wars.The only part of the book I didn't like was, that after reading almost half of the the book set in WWI times, the story flashes forward to 1979 and Stephen's grandaughter and her search for information on her deceased grandfather. While there was some interesting aspects of her story, I felt like it just didn't belong.The book, though, is an admirable novel of WWI of which there are too few.

It is one of the most disturbing accounts of the effects of atrocities upon the human mind I have ever read. A friend of mine who is a psychiatrist, and specialises in the effects of shock on the mind, borrowed this from me and was impressed with the accurate portrayal of the reactions of humans to extreme stress.The book starts some years before the war when a young english man, Stephen Wraysford, goes to stay with a French family to gain work experience. He falls in love with the wife of the family and they start a passionate affair eventually leading her to leave her husband and children. After moving to a small town and living together for some time, she leaves him to return to her family and, finally he returns to England.Years later he finds himself back in France under more strained circumstances, in the mud of the trenches.We follow Wraysford and the men under his command through the horrors of the campaigns across the fields of France, watching through their eyes as their comrades fall and their humanity is taken from them.The book ends by coming up to the present day and following a descendant of Wraysford as she traces his history and we eventually learn his full story.What is most shocking and, I am told by my psychiatrist friend, most realistic about this book is that the soldiers reactions become numbed to the carnage and that seeing so much horror on a daily basis lessens the effect, or apparant effect, on them. Perhaps this isn't so surprising given that the rise in violence on tv and film is blamed for numbing us to the attrocities in the world.This book paints a graphic picture of the 1st World War and will make you think about exactly what the human mind can endure.Given the above you might wonder why you should read this book but I can assure you that the story is wonderful and amongst the horror there are human stories of love and friendship which will keep you reading.

I could only really envisage two of the people in the book - firstly a minor character called Monsieur B√©rard. He was an officious town counseller, a small town bully, used to bossing other people around. But he had presence, and for me he was there as a human being. The other character I responded to was Jack Firebrace, a tunneller, with superb listening skills...he would put his ear to the side of a tunnel and listen for enemy activity. He was a man with a family, whom we met via letters. He was a much bigger character in the book, and someone whose story I cared about, and responded to emotionally. These were the only two people I could relate to. I'm afraid the rest of the characters left me quite cold. The love affair at the beginning of the book just made me shrug my shoulders. The fighting scenes were almost like shadows on a wall. I could read and understand that they were awful, but on another level (an emotional level) I felt quite impervious to what was happening.I also didn't like the ploy of having extracts of the present day inserted into the narrative - following a half-hearted storyline about the contemporary granddaughter researching her grandfather's activities in and around the war. All of that seemed unnecessary.I am however grateful to the book for teaching me so much about World War One soldiers digging tunnels underground into one another's territory, in order to lay mines under enemy lines.

48,2591030711,11/13/2018,5.0,"I wanted to read this book for a long time as I knew it was considered one of the best novels for the First World War. Finally, this moment arrived and the first thing I can say is that I'm sorry it did not come earlier. This is a book that I highly appreciated from his first page and until the end, it offered me a lot. Its writing style is particularly beautiful and emotional, with the author showing the necessary self-restraint to produce an elegant result, without exaggeration and unnecessary sentimentality. with this as a vehicle, he tells us a very moving story, with some of the very distinct and complete characters that the author moulds with mastery.The story begins in France a few years before the start of the First World War, when the world still unsuspecting for the imminent disaster was looking at its work in a place that would be one of the focal points of the war. During this quiet time, a forbidden love blooms and evolves in a way that is very common, with passion dominating, leaving logic aside. Whatever this evolution is, however, the important is that is something beautiful, as long as it last, and this beauty the author gives us as a gift, wrapping it in the most elegant way.Then, then, war comes and things are completely different. The two lovers, like a whole generation, change as they are injured by its consequences. Our hero participates in some of the toughest and bloodiest battles of the war and he sees all his barbarity, as people die as they walk towards the machine guns under a rain of shells, the result being nil as the trench war has brought a stalemate. Next to him are his co-warriors who also witness this situation and wonder if there is any point in all of this. Everyone reacts differently, others lose their logic, others pretend to do just a job that will soon end and they will return home, others try to use their patriotic feelings and hate for the enemy to find a balance, but everyone is convinced that something is wrong, that things are not as they said, and that the notions of heroism, duty and sacrifice make no sense in this slaughterhouse. The only positive thing in this hell is that all this brutality and the constant threat of death unite them and forge the most powerful friendships that offer the only consolation.That's what I think is the best part of the book, as the writer, without trying to do philosophy, puts his simple thoughts through the characters he creates, and because these characters have a truth on them, each representing different pieces of society, these thoughts have something special and carry to the reader all the trauma created by the war, with disappointment and resignation dominating as the memories of peaceful life seemed very distant.After all this, the author takes us many years later, at a time when that great war is almost forgotten. There the story closes its cycle, as the granddaughter of the lovers tries to learn more and so she becomes part of the story and its continuity and so in a way the author shows us what is the meaning of all of this, leaving us with something optimistic.A really wonderful book that definitely has a place in the classics of the genre, next to the more well-known masterpieces. Above all, however, it gains a special place in my heart.ŒâŒ∏ŒµŒªŒ± ŒΩŒ± Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≤Œ¨œÉœâ Œ±œÖœÑœå œÑŒø Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒØŒø ŒµŒ¥œé Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅœå Œ∫Œ±Œ∏œéœÇ Œ≥ŒΩœéœÅŒπŒ∂Œ± œåœÑŒπ Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒµŒØœÑŒ±Œπ Œ≠ŒΩŒ± Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ± Œ∫Œ±ŒªœçœÑŒµœÅŒ± ŒºœÖŒ∏ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒøŒΩ œÄœÅœéœÑŒø Œ†Œ±Œ≥Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒπŒø Œ†œåŒªŒµŒºŒø.

49,73491486,10/05/2009,5.0,"This was my second reading of Birdsong, and I expected to be less stunned, less appalled, and less involved in this masterpiece of a novel. I couldn't have been more wrong. Even on second reading, Birdsong retains huge power as a novel. It serves as a hugely important reminder of the near past, of the sacrifices that were made by our very close ancestors to preserve our way of life. It's full of passion, of the resilience of human nature, and the depths that humanity can dredge in times of war. The main character is Stephen Wraysford, and the story starts by him embarking on a passionate affair with the Mistress of the house he comes to stay at in Northern France, just before the First World War. What follows is a novel that crosses decades and continents, depicting the vital importance of our history to modern day living. It's alternately devastating and optimistic. What stands out to me the most is the contrast between the war the young men experienced in the fields of France and Belgium, in comparison to everyone ""doing their bit,"" back home. The effective creation of an entire generation of lost young men, who's lives would never recover from the dreadful things they witnessed in the course of battle is truly devastating. Books like this need to be read, these men need to be remembered, and Birdsong should be on every school reading list. It's vital, magnificient, and human.

One of the Burberry Boys, Eddie Redmayne of the bruised looking lips as Stephen Wraysford in the new BBC film.Sebastian Faulks‚Äô epic love story set against the First World War, which became a modern classic when it was published in 1993, is adapted for the screen for the first time by Abi Morgan.The action of the two part serial moves between 1910 and 1916, telling the story of Stephen Wraysford, a young Englishman who arrives in Amiens in Northern France to stay with the Azaire family and falls desperately in love with Isabelle Azaire. They begin an illicit and all-consuming affair, but the relationship falters.Years later, Stephen finds himself serving on the Western Front in the very area where he experienced his great love. As he battles amidst the blood and gore of the trenches he meets Jack Firebrace, a tunneller who unexpectedly helps him endure the ravages of war and enables him to make peace with his feelings for Isabelle.After part the second I am not sure what the point of this was. Lots of pretty pictures of pretty boys and girls and shocking pictures of WW1 trenches. Sigh. Whatever. ",7,0.9428,0.085,0.768,0.147,0.5057621671258035,NEGATIVE,0.9915

Overall, I think that Faulks spread himself too thin and, as a result, missed the mark entirely. Faulks was desperately trying to engage a female audience in a war novel but he ended up dumbing down a potentially good story and disappointing all readers.The description of life in the trenches was exceptional. The daily fatigue of a soldier is palpable and the conditions atrocious. The trench soldiers truly lacked any understanding of the 'why' about each episode of battle but they did what was asked of them without hesitation. Knowing that they were going to their undeniable death, over the top of the trench, directly into enemy machine gun fire, was unbelievable and so well told. I was flipping through those pages on the edge of my seat. The scenes within the sappers' tunnels were so eye-opening. I really felt the claustrophobia of those poor men trapped underground with no light, water or means of escape.But then, there would be some gratuitous and unnecessary sex scenes that grossed me out entirely. Faulks confusion between lust, love and romance was painfully evident. There were too many swollen 'members' and I almost convulsed at his referral to a woman's vulva as a 'gash' (how romantic). His attempt to bring the 1970s storyline into his WW1 novel also felt distracting, as this modern woman was more concerned with the scraps of attention that her pathetic, married boyfriend doled out than the history that she essentially had someone else uncover for her.It is my only Faulks read and I doubt that I will go back for more.",6,-0.986,0.196,0.702,0.102,0.5469135802469135,POSITIVE,0.9643

60,976784340,06/24/2014,3.0,"Lest we forget...Birdsong is undoubtedly one of the best known modern novels about World War I so it‚Äôs not surprising that a new edition has been issued to coincide with the centenary. I avoided it when it was going through it‚Äôs initial huge success ‚Äì to be honest, I try to avoid books about war as often as possible; not easy when you live in a country as obsessed as Britain is by the two big wars of last century. However, Faulks swam onto my horizon recently with his very good Jeeves homage Jeeves and the Wedding Bells and so I was tempted to read the book that he‚Äôs most famous for.There are three main parts to the book, and the connecting thread between them is the main protagonist Stephen Wraysford. By far the best written and most emotional part of the book is the middle section, when Stephen is on active service in the trenches of WW1. Faulks‚Äô depiction of the mud and filth of the trenches, the bloodiness and horror that the troops faced on a daily basis, the sheer exhaustion and increasing hopelessness as the war wore interminably on, is convincing and sickening in equal measure. Faulks splits this part of the narrative so that we partly follow Stephen, an officer with certain privileges, and partly some of his men, especially Jack Firebrace, a miner who is digging tunnels for the laying of mines. As the war drags on, Faulks shows the futility of the small gains and losses for which so many lives were lost or shattered. There is a tendency for Faulks to take it too far on occasion ‚Äì to slip almost into bathos, as he piles one tragedy after another on the same poor soldier‚Äôs head. And I found it a little trite that the only German officer we met was a patriotic German Jew. But putting these issues aside, this main part of the book is well worth reading and would probably have gained it a five-star rating from me.BUT ‚Äì unfortunately there are the two other sections. The third part is a rather pointless and extraneous strand set in the 1970s, when a descendant of Stephen sets out to find out what happened to him. This section is only there so that Faulks can give a pointed little 'Lest We Forget' message, suggesting that indeed we have forgotten and must now remember. I felt the main part of the book had made that point adequately without it needing to be emphasised with all the subtlety of a baseball bat to the head. And then there‚Äôs the first section ‚Äì the pre-war love story, when young Stephen has an affair with the older wife of the man in whose house he is staying. I say love story, but it is actually a lust story ‚Äì the two lovers rarely talk other than to decide where next they can have sex. And unfortunately, Faulks just doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to make sex sound like fun. As he gives us detail after detail of each positional change, each bodily fluid and its eventual destination, each grunt, groan and sigh, I developed a picture of poor Elizabeth, the love interest, as one of those bendy toys that used to be so popular. As so often in male sex fantasies, her willingness, nay, desperation, to have sex with Stephen knows no bounds, so we‚Äôve barely finished the cigarette after the last session before we‚Äôre off again. Oh dear! It honestly is some of the worst written sex I‚Äôve ever read. (I wonder if anyone has considered marketing it as a form of contraception?) And this affair which is so important at the beginning of the book fades almost entirely into the background and seems to serve very little purpose thereafter.All-in-all, I found the book very unbalanced ‚Äì some great writing, some poor writing; a fragmented plot that perhaps tries to do too much; and a tendency on Faulks‚Äô part not to trust his readers, but to feel he had to beat his 'message' into them with a blunt instrument. Although the section about the war is powerful and emotive, the rest of the book didn‚Äôt really work for me at all.

61,300888070,06/18/2017,3.0,"With the current centenary of WW1 happening, I have read a lot of literatue about it- either written by those that participated, or since then. This is a contemporary novel. The title is a subtle indicator of what some of the main narrative is about. I had never heard of the mining operations that went on during some of the nastiest battles- the Somme for example. This is serious mining ‚Äì going down some feet, then horizontal shafts & side shafts & ultimately, packed with explosives and boom ‚Äì you have messed with the enemy‚Äôs trenches. Now you get the idea of the title.The war aspect of this novel is intense, in places fast paced, and I feel, captures the exhaustion of the army. There is a tragic scene where one of our characters is killed by a sniper through a hole in the trench. He has survived some of the most horrific battles, but his exhaustion makes him a target because he forgot a fundamental aspect. Had he not been so fatigued, he would never have made this clumsy error. The novel has various portrayals of death by exhaustion, poor judgement, or jingoistic daring-do. Then there is the incompetence of the brass (the description of the lead up to the start of the Battle of the Somme is chilling); and finally, the way the war stopped being in the civilians faces by mid war. They stopped caring and treated it as an inconvenience. This is a small nod to Sassoon, and how the soldiers felt overall. There is so much evidence about the soldiers' disgust back home. I loved the humanity he portrayed in letters to back home; the sentiments of those that are dying and what is important to them. He obviously, read war letters and he captures this pathos wonderfully. These are the best bits about the novel, and Faulks should have stuck to this. He writes in his intro that he felt he was concerned with too much war and so decided to off-set it with other bits. This was his error.I rather like the pre-war love interest (other reviewers haven't). This makes sense to me (having encountered plenty of then contemporary literature of young men being sent to offices on the Continent to learn more of the trade) and I even felt the romance was believable. The young man‚Äôs background isn‚Äôt the standard overly stuffy family one, so he wouldn‚Äôt have the same boundaries ‚Äì and we all know about when not at home, young‚Äôuns tend to play up; they still do as backpackers. I felt the romance worked well into the war narrative and the bending of Mr ‚ÄúUnbendable, but close to Breaking‚Äù when he becomes emotionally involved with Jeanne, the sister.But then it was spoilt by some stupidity about the grandchild hunting down her ancestors. Who cares?? She certainly doesn‚Äôt at the start. I wanted to rip out those pages and burn them. And then we have some stupid tying in of ends. No: war is messy, people lose contact and never connect again. It trivialised the whole story, and I can‚Äôt understand why people think this is such a wonderful novel.

62,464330206,11/26/2012,4.0,"There is something odd about the structure of 'Birdsong'. It centres around the experiences of Stephen Wraysford before and during the First World War, yet there is also a sort of framing storyline in the form of his granddaughter researching him. The latter I found rather ineffective, as it was only at the very end that it confirmed some information about Stephen that wasn‚Äôt provided by his own narration. On the other hand, Stephen himself was an excellent character and his story was incredibly well told and (as befits WWI stories) traumatically horrible. The trenches and the tunnels beneath them are vividly evoked, in fact the tunnel sequences gave me unpleasant flashbacks to Germinal‚Äôs mines. Although it took a little while to become engrossing, I appreciated the initial section set in 1910, as it demonstrated how Victorian life still was then and provided a sharp contrast to the world at war. I am torn about giving this book three stars or four. I think on balance I must give it four, as the account of trench warfare is so well told. I initially inclined towards three because this account is uncomfortable to read - as it should be! Stephen and others repeatedly state that the situation in which they find themselves is beyond endurance, beyond anything humans have suffered before, and surpasses belief. Thus fiction that can communicate some measure of that horror is important. It isn‚Äôt fun to read, though, and I imagine this book is especially unpleasant if you are subject to claustrophobia. I don‚Äôt think the 1970s sections were really necessary, but cannot deny that they were well written. It was also helpful to realise whilst reading ‚ÄòBirdsong‚Äô that, if I want to read cheering and distracting books to relax after writing my thesis all day, I would do well to avoid anything to do with the First World War.",5,0.4344,0.108,0.782,0.11,0.6067307692307692,NEGATIVE,0.9958

This was my first WWI book, and I can't imagine another giving me a more 'realistic' view of the soldiers in the trenches. The atrocities of WWI are unimaginable, yet somehow Faulks is able to help us imagine them, and feel the depths of sadness and despair that can be the only appropriate response to such senseless genocide. After reading the book, I went back and read the foreword, written by Faulks, and found that 9.7 million men died. I had no idea. I loved that the author was able to take us on a journey with Elizabeth in 1978, who was also discovering the horrific nature of the war for the first time. I was particularly struck by two passages in the book that showed society's reaction to soldiers returning from war midway through - when Stephen came from the frontline and tried to buy a shirt, and was hurried out, and when Weir returned home from his harrowing experience with no greeting and no acknowledgment from his family.The only drawback for me was the start of the novel. A bit smutty, unrealistic and unnecessary. I felt it didn't fit with the rest of the novel, and I struggled to stay invested in two such unusual and pretty unlikeable characters.

However, The World War 1 aspect definitely dominates the book with incredible realism and great prose.The first 100 or so pages tell a story about attraction and passion. Two strangers meet and are swept away ‚Äì one by the aliveness of the other, one by the attention of the other. Two strangers physically lust after each other and can‚Äôt get enough of each other. Two strangers forsake others and run away together. One stranger seems to truly love the other, at least on a superficial level. It is his first sexual experience. The other seems to be seeking escape from an abusive, boring and unfulfilling relationship. She really didn‚Äôt seem genuinely interested in starting anew or trying again. Many reviewers were full of praises for the description of the sensual nature of the relationship. I agree that there seemed to be a great deal of physical attraction and passion but it seemed to be more about lust, physical obsession and emotional need than sensual. I thought it dragged at times and found myself often putting the book down and was not really able to ‚Äúget into‚Äù the book. The World War 1 story was a different matter. Despite having read a number of World War 11 stories, this was the first World War 1 story I have read. The author‚Äôs detail and writing was so descriptive and so real that I had a great deal of difficulty reading it ‚Äì to the point that I put the book down for a while and considered not finishing the book. This time, putting down the book was due to great writing. The author‚Äôs describes trench warfare in such detail and with so much realism, that I could smell the dirt in the tunnels, imagine myself crawling in tunnels so small that one couldn‚Äôt turn and got myself worked up into a claustrophobic state. I confess small spaces have never really been my thing but I thought I got over this many years ago. The author describes the diggers crawling on their backs, unable to turn because the space was so small. They are crawling only a few feet below the enemy above, often clawing inches at a time to make the tunnels longer, listening constantly for sounds of the enemy in a tunnel or battlefield above. I could feel the dirt and the dampness. I felt the earth in my pores and my heart beat faster with the fear of earth collapsing all around me. The prose was very powerful.Digging the trenches was not the only topic that the author wrote about so well. Sebastian Faulk writes incredibly lyrically and descriptively throughout this book, be it about war, feelings, thoughts, the countryside, birds and animals or relationships. I now understand why he has been given so many accolades for his literary writing style and for Birdsong in particular. In addition to the physical horrors of war, much of the book is character description. The author delves into the psychological challenges that the war participants faced. The characters are incredibly well described and reflect a wide continuum, likely a representative cross-section of the real soldiers in World War 1. Some were cerebral and turned off emotions, some turned to the bottle for solace and numbing, others were salt of the earth and camaraderie was their release. Each man (at the time no woman participated in combat) dealt with the war in his own way. Most of the men wanted to help their country but nearly all of them had no way of emotionally or spiritually dealing with the atrocities they witnessed. Even the killing of enemy soldiers was an assault on their psyches, never mind the slaughter and degradation of their peers as they stood beside them. The prose is so good and the deaths described in such real terms that they seem to be happening as you read the book. The pain of the soldiers is tragic and very palpable. The more I read, the more I felt and the more I understood viscerally the senseless tragedy and carnage of body and spirit caused by war.Many men die physically. Many die emotionally. Only a few survive spiritually. The wide swath of damage was brought home again and again in Birdsong. The philosophy of life and death and surviving such brutality is an underlying theme of the book.

The book stirred the full gamut of my emotions.It is set in different periods of time, before, during and after the war ‚Äì and the author creates a real sense of the era in which he writes.The story begins in France where the protagonist, Stephen Wraysford, stays as a guest with the Azaire family: Rene, his two children and wife Isabelle. The purpose of the visit was for Stephen to learn about the French textile industry. Whilst there, Stephen notices problems with the Azaire‚Äôs marriage. There were indications that Rene was physically taking his frustrations out on Isabelle, for reasons, which she later confides in Stephen. Although Isabelle was much older than Stephen there was a mutual attraction prior to them embarking on a steamy affair. Their erotic love story is written in explicit detail. Isabelle then makes a life changing decision and leaves Rene and luxury for Stephen with nothing, believing she loves him as he does her. As the story unfolds it reveals whether their attraction will survive the excitement of their clandestine, illicit, love affair. When World War 1 breaks out, Stephen becomes a Lieutenant Officer in the army and ends up fighting on the front line. I‚Äôve read various non-fictional accounts of the battle of the Somme, but in this novel, which reads like a vivid real life story, I felt I was actually there! I could imagine being repelled by the gruesome sights. I almost felt nauseous by the description of the foul smelling trenches. I sensed the men‚Äôs almost palpable fear and even itched with their lice infestation. When the men were in the narrow tunnels underground I could actually feel their claustrophobia. Although it was all very graphic we know it wasn‚Äôt gratuitous because the real Somme was also like hell on earth.There was a complete transformation in the men‚Äôs psyche after the unimaginable horrors they‚Äôd seen: The men who fought together had forged such a strong bond that they loved each other like family. Their camaraderie was endearing. But they became so inured to witnessing death and losing comrades that they became numb and emotionless. The men they loved quickly became blurred in a distant memory and their names forgotten, like ghosts from the past. It is one of the most moving books I‚Äôve ever read. If ever there was a story that expressed the futility of war this is it. Stephen‚Äôs granddaughter, Elizabeth, had found his notes and gradually made sense of them. In the denouement, her mother revealed a last bit of information, which had puzzled Elizabeth. It completed a wonderful story with no loose ends.

You might consider yourself reasonably well educated about World War I -- about the brutality of trench warfare and the unimaginable loss of life -- but you haven't been there, not in the trenches and especially not in the tunnels that snaked under the battlefields, built by both sides, sometimes within feet of each other, at least not the way Faulks puts you there.

The first hundred-plus pages introducing the protagonist and building up to a torrid love affair are mostly tedious and unnecessary. And the intermittent present-day framing device, in which an educated but oblivious young woman suddenly decides to unearth her family's history is worse. But most of the book and certainly the parts that will burn into your brain are about the war. It's almost too painful to read but impossible to put down...the years of carnage, of fear, of filth, the conflict between wanting to live and wanting to die, the inability to even envision a normal life...Faulks's prose is unadorned and unsparing, as if only by stripping the language down to stark essentials can he convey the unspeakable. Birdsong was published more than twenty years ago. I finally picked it up because in exchange for a review, I was sent Faulks's most recent novel, Where My Heart Used To Beat, his (I think) seventeenth, and I thought it wise to first read the book for which he is best known and lauded. It will be interesting to see which Faulks wrote the new book -- the uninspired love novelist or the superb war novelist. ",4,0.9737,0.119,0.709,0.171,0.6299062049062049,NEGATIVE,0.9997

By the end of part one (Birdsong is presented in seven distinct parts) I was really rather fed up and ready to DNF. However, I decided to carry on into part two for a chapter to see if the outbreak of the war made a difference and it did- I was really beginning to enjoy the story. As well as the better story, Faulks had a way of bringing the trenches, the mines, and the Somme to life, with passages that I will never forget. ""It was as though the land were disgorging a generation of crippled sleepers, each one distinct but related to its twisted brothers as they teemed up from the reluctant earth."" After this section, I didn't really enjoy Birdsong again until part six, when (view spoiler)[Stephen and Jack were trapped under No Man's Land, and Stephen was rescued by German soldiers (hide spoiler)]. I can't really explain these differing experiences to what I was reading, but they were there. Perhaps the modernish story was less appealing, as it was not a story arc I was expecting to read. Birdsong was recommended to me by several people, and perhaps I expected a bit too much. I really enjoyed some of it, and could even offer five stars for part two alone, but on the other hand I can't ignore that I was bored by other parts.

I recall it being an emotionally draining, high to low to high to low movie that pulled a lot out of me just watching it.

Opposite him, a young woman appears in and out of the book, 60 years later, and it is only truly revealed how she is connected to him. Her curiosity pulls her closer to Wraysford through her research and reading of his coded journals.""Birdsong"" is a love story, a war story and a contemporary mystery all in one. There were stretches of this book that were absolutely captivating, and those where I really wondered if I would pull through because I really couldn't get in to many of the secondary characters. Stick with it, readers - the last hundred or so pages are well worth it.

78,2045865802,07/01/2017,3.0,"Birdsong is Sebastian Faulks' big novel of sex and death. The parting and opening of flesh to reveal the secrets beneath ‚Äì¬†whether it's flesh made moist in tenderness and desire (as in the adulterous affair which opens the novel in France 1910) or bodies rent and annihilated in (and under) the trenches during the Great War just a handful of years later.The novel moves between three time periods (a brief but volatile love-affair in pre-war France, the charnel grind of the First World War, and a historical detective story some 60 years later). Information about the central character of the first two sections, a young English merchant called Stephen Wraysford, is the object of a descendent's quest in the final section, although other connections are revealed with some emotional resonance as the novel progresses.I enjoyed it and found it quite moving. It is, for the most part, gripping and the descriptions of tunnelling work beneath the trenches in France are genuinely harrowing. As are the evocations of friendship and the precariousness of sanity and life along the Western Front. Faulks does not shy away from depicting the sheer degradation and waste of war. The novel has a few problems in its construction and pacing, it's occasionally a little obvious, but the flaw I found the most irritating, and ‚Äì on the final page ‚Äì¬†almost unforgivable is the confusion of point of view and voice at different points. Faulks' third-person narration generally privileges Wraysford's point of view when he is present in a scene, although there are occasional lurches away to take in the thoughts or responses of another character. It's inelegant but I can live with it. But this tic of Faulks spoiled the final paragraphs of the novel for me. Where it would have been a powerful and emotional climax symbolising the triumph of life, love and hope over death, silence and destruction if it had been told from the point of view of Elizabeth, a character we had come to know and care for, Faulks abruptly throws the novel's conclusion to a character we had barely glimpsed and for whom I cared less than nothing.

84,1384065579,09/05/2015,3.0,"Probably the best story I've read about the Great war! So why did I only give it 3 stars instead of 5? I will try to explain. It is a story of love and war, following the life of a young Englishman, Stephen Wraysford. It starts in pre-war France, where he meets a beautiful women and falls in love. Of course their relationship fails, and he is left brokenhearted. Instead of returning to England, he enlists in the war. Next, we follow Stephen and a group of soldiers during the war from 1914 to 1918, from their being slaughtered at the Somme, to the victory of the war, and every dark, grisly, and at times, humorous moments in between. Finally, the book ends with Stephen's Granddaughter researching the war in hopes of trying to find information on who he really was.This structure can work well, and I have enjoyed books in the past that follow different generations through time. But, it didn't work in this book. It was a mixed bag of 3 different books only vaguely related. Thankfully, the majority of the book focused on the war section, which was 5/5 stars. The other 2 sections feel disjointed from the main story because the 2 women characters are not relatable. His love interest, Isabelle, in pre-war France was selfish and cold. I found their relationship had no chemistry and they only reason he loved her was because she was beautiful. The relationship didn't feel believable to me at all. I understand the author was trying to show character development and explain why he was bitter and tormented and joined the war. However, Isabelle, and their relationship just didn't work.Following the war, the reader is thrown 60 years into the future and follows his Granddaughter and her life. She knows nothing of him or the war, so she starts to research the past. Once again, she was an annoying, selfish and a stupid character. She didn't even know the difference between WWI and WWII or when they occurred! What are they teaching at school in Britain!!! But, the story didn't even really focus on her looking into her Grandfather, but followed her fashion business and a love affair she was having with a married man!? Way too tangential and off topic. Luckily it was the shortest section of the book. It's too bad, because the majority of the book takes place during the war and is amazing. Faulks brings to life the horror of trench warfare. From the morning tea served in petrol cans and tasting vile, to their lice filled clothes that couldn't be killed, and sleeping in the cold and mud along with the rats and sometimes the dead. The development of Stephen and the soldiers through the 4 years of war, and what they each needed to do to survive and come to grip with their mortality was so real and moving. This novel could be a stand alone without the pre and post war sections. ",3,-0.98,0.145,0.756,0.099,0.5809027777777777,NEGATIVE,0.9996

I found all the characters in this part convincing and was pulled in by the love story, though I found the sex scenes somewhat overwritten and also there are a few patches of purplish prose, especially descriptions of the earth smelling rotten, etc, which are too obviously intended to look forward to the war and the trenches. The book then jumps abruptly to several years later, when Stephen is fighting in the war - and keeps going to and fro between him and Elizabeth, a descendant in 1970s London. I didn't think either of these parts was as powerful as the opening, although some passages about the war are moving and have a nightmarish intensity about them, especially where characters are shut up in tunnels under the ground.

I embarked on reading Birdsong with initial reluctance. Tales of the war don't generally appeal to me but this book is truly exceptional. Faulks succeeded in creating a poignant love story whilst never diluting the atrocities of war. The scenes in the trenches portray the depths of human despair and the barbarity of combat; this is counterbalanced by the beautiful love story between Stephen and Isabelle. The relationship between Stephen and Jack Firebrace was carefully crafted. The contrast between the middle class, distant, seemingly cold Wraysford and Firebrace's compassionate and tenacious character could have been a stereotypical caricature of the British class system; however, Faulks showed that human emotions- love and fear- are no respecters of class or creed.

109,230707507,11/03/2011,5.0,"The first part of Birdsong draws you into a perfect summer several years before the First World War. Faulks focusses on the minutiae of relationships and provincial life magnifying the characters, making them culpable, flawed and human. The sudden break at the end of part one structurally reflects the emotional trauma of heartbreak setting the scene for later in the novel. Switching between the trenches of the First World War, described in vivid and often gruesome detail, and the calm peaceful, depiction of an idyllic England Faulks creates a sense of disjointed reality perhaps mimicking that experienced by those returning from the front on leave. This structural mechanism also creates some sense of the emotional void the protagonist experiences. The full horror of the trenches can never be fully experienced by the reader and indeed, Stephen, the main character becomes progressively more removed from his own emotions and those things which keep us human as the war progresses. Throughout the novel we slowly see him shutting down, the only coping mechanism he has. Already an isolated character that is difficult to identify with (similar in many ways to the protagonist in Engleby) we see him at the start of the novel with the hope of redemption from the difficult, lonely childhood. Faulk‚Äôs description of genteel bourgeois life in provincial France with its accompanying love affairs and familial life, a young man‚Äôs passionate, illicit affair and evocation of small industrial town life serves to highlight the destruction wreaked upon an entire generation across Europe. Those men we see striking at the factory are soon to be mown down by machine guns, row upon row leaving the women we see adored and feted behind. Women we meet again later in the novel, dressed in black in a half destroyed town and Isabelle (the object of Stephen‚Äôs adoration) with a (perhaps symbolically) half destroyed face, the victim of the german occupation of Amiens. Contrasting the scenes of decomposing bodies, constant shelling and squalor of the trenches as men struggle to survive, to the early depictions of the Water Gardens at Thiepval (later close to the site of a devastating battle) brings a further sense of unreality to the novel; creating the same confused reality experienced by those fighting in the trenches then returning to ‚Äònormality‚Äô. Switching swiftly to a description of a romance in London in the 1970s it highlights how our ‚Äòtroubles‚Äô post WWI are trivial although they can feel overwhelming when struggling through them. They are similar concerns as those experienced prior to the war. Faulk‚Äôs description of the thick stagnant water in the Gardens at Thiepval reflects the wealthy existence of the middle classes. Isabelle is trapped in her life as a wife and step-mother until Stephen disrupts their comfortable reality. The similarly trivial concerns of Elizabeth in London in 1978 as she gradually uncovers her grandfather‚Äôs time on the front line contrast dramatically. It serves as a stark reminder of the horrors endured by a generation of men and how, in many ways, we show our ‚Äòappreciation‚Äô by completely ignoring the freedom, peace and security they bought us with their lives, taking it for granted. It is particularly heartbreaking to discover Brennan, left to live a waking death in a home since the end of the war. Inadequate understanding of the full impact of ‚Äòshell shock‚Äô and inadequate care provision leaves him, a hero, slowly decomposing in an armchair in a home, forgotten about and unloved. We also get a sense of how impossible it was for soldiers returning from the front to readjust to civilian life on Stephen‚Äôs leave. He has no family to return to and can barely be with himself. Later we learn it took him two years before he spoke again after returning from France. He seems to be constantly wandering, searching for something. Whether it is the love he felt for Isabelle and then sealed himself off from or something else, it remains unclear. However, he stands as a figurehead for a whole generation of men. Those that survived, unable to talk about the horrors they endured; those wanting to talk (Weir) not able to find someone to listen. Birdsong is an extraordinary discussion of love and the limits of human character. Set against the backdrop of the most devastating and inhumane conflict ever seen there are multiple threads of love sustaining both the reader and Faulk‚Äôs characters. It is love for Isabelle that destroys Stephen, removing him emotional engagement with those around him, creating a cold, ‚Äústrange‚Äù and outwardly heartless officer. He cannot feel the love for his soldiers that Captain Gray asks him to because in part he is incapable of loving as he has discovered it is safer not to. However, when Weir dies he discovers that he is more than capable of love. Weir is the only person that has seen everything he has seen. He is one of the last of the original battalion that went to the front together. Following his death Stephen falls into a cold emotionless state. He shuts down from all around him and is a shell of a human ‚Äútired in his soul‚Äù. Stephen is a difficult character to warm to but one who demands your attention.The heartbreak he feels, although not described explicitly, when Isabelle leaves him permeates through the book. Having loved so freely and so young, with such trust and hope, to have it taken away so suddenly and without explanation will leave scars as deep as those later seen on Isabelle‚Äôs once perfect face. By not speaking about it, by maintaining his ‚Äòstiff upper lip‚Äô we can see how Stephen copes with the trenches but we also see a damaged young man hurt further. Unable to trust again he becomes wary and learns that it is easier to be self-sufficient than to risk losing something or someone you love. Something we see repeated in the lives of his fellow soldiers ‚ÄìJack Firebrace loses his son, Brennan loses his brother and Stephen loses Weir. Personal note: I struggle to comprehend the enormity of the devastation of the First World War. The vast scale of the destruction of human life, the conditions, desperation and ultimate futility of it are too devastating to allow ourselves collectively to think about it: the staggering bravery of the men, men who were brothers, fathers, sons, lovers, friends. Faulks forces the reader to engage emotionally with the war and achieves wonders through his ability to create empathy, to bring alive something that was unspoken and is still not fully comprehended. We owe the lives we live today to these brave men. Faulks‚Äô clever juxtaposition of Elizabeth‚Äôs safe, comfortable 20th century life, her independence, and the luxury of her comparatively petty concerns and frivolous life are all down to the lives given between 1914-1918. The wider impact of this war gave women the opportunity to work and ultimately led to Elizabeth being in a position where it is socially acceptable to live alone and work for herself. She can afford to be picky about her lovers, be pregnant and single and not accept the offer of marriage received in her late 30s. Just sixty years earlier marriage would have been her only option, that is if she had been able to find a man after the genocide in France and Belgium. We owe so much to those who fought and Faulks is right to remind us of this. ",2,0.9219,0.115,0.764,0.121,0.5129567486950039,POSITIVE,0.9985
110,3826285492,02/20/2021,5.0,"Having been recommended to me by several people over the course of a good few years, I decided to finally read this modern classic without reading anything about it beforehand. Not the back cover synopsis, not any reviews, nothing. I vaguely knew it ‚Äòwas about WWI‚Äô and that was about as far as my knowledge spanned. The last two books I read before this were The Tattooist of Auschwitz followed by its sequel Cilka‚Äôs Journey, both of which I wanted to love based on the hype, but which I felt very letdown and underwhelmed by, based on the flat, rushed writing which I felt lacked colour, connection and description. Birdsong delivered everything I wanted from those aforementioned titles, plus so much more. The story in Birdsong is great and has a satisfying conclusion, but where this book‚Äôs strength lies is in Sebastian Faulk‚Äôs prose and writing style. His way with using language to transport the reader into the story is incredible. Faulks does not hold back on divulging the horrors of war and trench warfare and I felt absolutely everything his words outlined. I would say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt read if you can‚Äôt handle graphic gore‚Äù, but I feel that this book should be read by every person now who exists because of those who perished in WWI, just as the characters suffer on Faulk‚Äôs pages. I have never audibly gasped and recoiled so much at a book. On several occasions I felt nauseous. I also grew to know the characters very quickly and felt invested in their stories - something which also lacked in the two books I‚Äôd read before this one. There is one main story which is told throughout this book, but upon reflection there are also so many subplots which are just as moving. Perhaps the most notable is the development of Stephen‚Äôs character and how drastically his personality and behaviours shift and change as he is affected by everything you‚Äôre going through with him. Half way through this book, I made a mental note to re-read it within six months, to attempt to remind myself and permanently process what the soldiers of WWI endured, largely against their will.

They have a time and a place but here wasn't one of them. Part 4: the writing in the trenches was the most enjoyable part and not only in this section. However the writing was all over the place. Every other sentence referred to someone else and made it hard to follow. Part 5: I still don't care about this affair. Way too many words given to explaining that rather than to explaining Brennan's story or even the original story! Part 6: probably the best part so far because it just focused on one story and went further with it. By the end I was intrigued and wanted to read more. I wanted to know what happened once he walked back over into no man's land, did he keep in contact with Levi? Who was left in the English trenches? What happened straight after the war? But no, I was unpleasantly surprised to see part 7. I still don't are about this predictable affair! What did it even bring to the story? The entire outcome was given a paragraph at the dinner table. Faulks spent 200 pages too many building up each character only to sum up their lives in a few pages. What a cop out!I would also like to point Faulks in the direction of Thesaurus.com.

116,1798277761,10/30/2016,5.0,"Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks was recently book of the month in my book group. It is a book often studied for exams. It is an epic love story set against the First World War, a modern classic that was adapted for film in 2012 with which I was already familiar. However, a book group can never go far wrong with a novel by Sebastian Faulks. Another of his novels after P.G Wodehouse, Jeeves and the Wedding Bells at https://bookreviewstoday.info/2013/12.... Sebastian Charles Faulks CBE is a British novelist, journalist and broadcaster. He is best known for his historical novels set in France including The Girl at the Lion d'Or and Charlotte Gray. He was born aon 20 April, 1953. He was educated at Emaanuel College, Cambridge, England and Wellington College, Berkshire. Birdsong is another of his novels set in France.Stephen Wraysford marches to the front on the day before the Somme Offensive.He leads his company down a track across farmland and comes upon something odd. Wraysford describes: ""two dozen men, naked to the waist, digging a hole thirty yards square at the side of the path"" and realised that they were digging a mass grave. When his men see it, the reader is told: ""The songs died on their lips and the air was reclaimed by the birds."" The songs ""die"" and hs men will too, almost as readily. Birdsong has to imagine mechanised slaughter.Faulks's the description of the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the reader is told of death that comes so thick and fast, the narrative cannot pause for individuals. Stephen watches as a line of troops comes forward into the range of German machine guns, ""which traversed them with studied care until every man had gone down in a diagonal line from first to last.""The soldiers at the front have to learn not to be shocked, not even to be emotional, at any particular person's death, and the manner of Faulks's narration has to reflect this. Deaths are narrated through the eyes of particular characters. From Stephen's original platoon, only three men remain alive at the front. ""The names and faces of the others were already indistinct in his memory."" Sometimes Stephen recalled ""a voice, a smile, a habitual trick of speech"", but these are dismembered aspects of personality rather than clues to any distinct individuals. This is a war in which explosives can reduce men to dust.Tens of thousands of men simply go missing, their names recorded on monuments such as the arch at Thiepvale. It shocks the reader today, as much as Stephen's grand-daughter Elizabeth in the section of the novel set in the 1970s: ""names teeming, reeling, over surfaces of yards, of hundreds of yards, over furlongs of stone"". The novel kindles indignation by reflecting this oblivion.The readers' sympathies are manipulated.In one battle, Stephen finds himself fighting alongside a fellow officer called Ellis and trys to talk him out of despair. Reinforcements arrive just in time, and Stephen retires with his men to their own trench. ""Ellis had been killed by machine gun fire."" We heard him speaking a few lines earlier, but his death is noted in passing. Just because the reader cares about a character does not mean that he will be saved.Michael Weir, is a friend of Stephen. At one point the reader learns about Weir on home leave, and painfully witnesses his faltering attempts to describe his experiences to his father. Naturally, his father does not want to hear about his son's ordeal. The novel carefully acquaints you with this nervous, intelligent, fearful man, but then Weir is killed almost casually. It happens in a scene between Weir and Stephen. Weir walks towards him one day, Stephen notices that some parapet sandbags have become misplaced and is about to warn him. ""Weir climbed on to the firestep to let a ration party go past and a sniper's bullet entered his head above the eye, causing trails of his brain to loop out on to the sandbags behind him.""After all the deaths that he has seen around him, Jack Firebrace thinks himself ""immune to death"". He imagines that he will survive, also that death cannot touch him. How wrong he is. No sooner does he have this thought than something happens to change it. He receives a letter from his wife, Margaret, in which she mentions that their only child, John, ""has been very poorly indeed and the doctor says it is diphtheria"". The novelist painfully manipulates the reader's emotions, again. Among so many deaths, the possible death of this little boy, whom they know only through the character's intense affection for him, is the one that affects the reader most.When Jack receives a subsequent letter from his wife, he keeps it unopened during his next mission, as if keeping his son alive that bit longer. Of course the child is dead, and his father's every reason for imagining his own survival dissolves.Birdsong is an adept piece of writing that is evocative of the horrors of war and the emotion that arise from those horrors. If you have not read Birdsong, I recommend it. If you have, reread it. If you are required to study it, do not fear Birdsong: it is a most rewarding book.Valerie Penny ",2,-0.9959,0.122,0.808,0.07,0.5020138888888888,POSITIVE,0.6887

126,2206897666,03/04/2018,4.0,"On the cover of ""Birdsong"", it says:¬†A NOVEL OF LOVE AND WAR.¬†""Birdsong"" really is about those two things, but separately. It is a novel about love. It is a novel about war. The two parts of the book are so different from each other that I found myself wondering how it was still the same book.¬†Perhaps this effect was intended. The novel starts off as an ordinary historical romance. We are shown the affair between Stephen Wraysford and Isabelle Azaire. It's the sort of story we are used to, talking about the sort of feelings we are used to. Being in love, feeling angry at the ones who don't understand us, wanting to free ourselves and be with the one we love.Then we are thrown into the middle of World War I, and we are faced with a completely different set of feelings. Fear of being buried alive under a tunnel deep beneath no man's land. Seeing all the bodies, twisted and rotten beyond recognition. Knowing you have to write a generic letter to their mothers and their widows. Killing one of your own to ease their suffering, praying a wounded soldier will die soon so that he won't have to suffer any more. Carrying the pieces of your own brother home in a bag to be buried. These feelings, they are unnatural, unspeakable, no one should have them. And how can it be possible that Stephen Wraysford, the same Stephen from Book I who had such an ordinary life with such ordinary concerns, is going through¬†all of this.Most eloquent of all were the photographs. There was one of a moon-faced boy gazing with shattered patience at the camera. This was his life, his actuality, Elizabeth thought, as real to him as business meetings, love affairs; as real as the banal atmosphere of the cross-channel ferry lounge, known to every modern holiday maker in Britain: his terror and imminent death were as actual and irreversible to him as were to her the drink from the bar, the night in the hotel ahead, and all the other fripperies of peacetime life that made up her casual, unstressed existence.This book is the process of the reader trying to understand who the protagonist Stephen is and what he becomes. We are not told much in the beginning, where we have the main love story. We know that he's an impulsive young man who is lusting after a married woman out of his league. We try to flesh out his character as we go along.Then there are the parts with Elizabeth, Stephen's granddaughter. The story alternates between WWI and Elizabeth's timeline. Elizabeth is going through Stephen's diaries and trying to piece together her family history and what her grandfather has been through. I thought they were a very nice break from the war storyline, because even though it was brilliant and deeply affecting, I could not handle going through that without any distractions. I liked the character of Elizabeth, I liked how she was honest with herself.¬†The love story is not a very solid one, especially the beginning of the affair. It's kind of old fashioned in the sense that these two people only need to know each other for a week to think that they are soulmates. Not to mention that I was a bit bothered by Stephen's... harassment of Isabelle. He relentlessly pursues this woman, not knowing anything about how she feels. He assumes that she must love him too, must be ready to risk her marriage and her comfortable life for this young man she just met. And the crazy thing is, she actually does.¬†This whole relationship is poorly constructed. Why does it begin, why does it end? No one knows.However, I found the World War I parts of Birdsong very profound and affecting. For me, Birdsong is primarily a war novel. ¬†We are given an insight into the front lines, and the tunnels. We are shown devastating scenes of death and suffering, of deep human sadness, and I think I will keep many with me for the rest of my life. Also the question Stephen asks himself throughout the book: how far will the men be willing to go? When will they say that it's too much?Now, as he listened, he could hear what Weir had meant: it was a low, continuous moaning. He could not make out any individual pain, but the sound ran down to the river on their left and up over the hill for half a mile or more. As his ear became used to the absence of guns, Stephen could hear it more clearly: it sounded to him as though the earth itself was groaning.¬†""Oh God, oh God."" Weir began to cry. ""What have we done, what have we done? Listen to it. We've done something terrible, we'll never get back to how it was before.""",2,-0.982,0.144,0.737,0.119,0.5136351495726494,NEGATIVE,0.9603
127,327066124,05/09/2012,4.0,"Birdsong‚Äôs cover advertises it as a ‚Äúnovel of love and war.‚Äù Cliched, but true enough. Faulk‚Äôs work has an odd feel about it for a modern (1993) work. With its omniscient narrator, constantly shifting pov, descriptive and narrative side trips, it seems almost Victorian. There is a visionary passage of unity of all creation that might have been pulled straight out of Thomas Hardy. Yet, a more accurate parallel might be with D.H. Lawrence for some of its torrid, protoplasmic sex and violence. Indeed, the war scenes, especially in part two, are among the most brutal I have ever read. I thought after all I had read about WWI over the last couple of years, I knew it all. However, Birdsong opened an entirely new aspect to me--the lives of the miners who tunneled underneath enemy lines planting explosives. Gives a literal meaning to the word ‚Äúmine,‚Äù and I understand where the word comes from now. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm getting this late deluge of WWI books at this stage in my life. I‚Äôm not seeking them out. Must mean something. I‚Äôll have to consult my guru, I guess. All that aside, this is a powerful book. It‚Äôs full of surprises, not just plot twists, but turns of character and emphasis. Things that seem to matter, suddenly do not. For example, the protagonist begins apparently intent on learning the textile business. Then that industry turns out to be of no consequence at all either to him or to the story. He is a serious, focused man, but capable of changing direction in an emotional minute. He is by nature, it seems, a detached person, an observer more than a participant. Yet, he is capable of giving himself completely to a situation or a moment regardless of consequences. It is that mystery of character that kept me turning the pages more than the drive to find out ‚Äúwhat happens next.‚Äù Another unique aspect of the novel is how the secondary characters define the main ones. The sister of the protagonist‚Äôs lover, for example, helps illuminate facets of both her sister and the protagonist. And our experience of both character and events changes constantly as perspectives change relative to relationships. It‚Äôs a complex and fascinating process. All amid some fine and complex writing: As the fever in his abandoned body reached its height... he heard a voice, not human, but clear and urgent. It was the sound of his life leaving him. Its tone was mocking. It offered him, instead of the peace he longed for, the possibility of return. ...he could go back to his body and to the brutal perversion of life that was lived in the turned soil and torn flesh of the war; he could, ...come back to the awkward, compromised, and unconquerable existence that made up human life... The voice was calling him; it appealed to his sense of shame and of curiosity unfulfilled: but if he did not heed it he would surely die. To add still another dimension, Faulk takes us back and forth between WWI and the 1970‚Äôs, introducing the protagonist‚Äôs granddaughter, whose yearning for meaning to her empty lifestyle provokes an investigation of her grandfather‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs an interesting point-counterpoint that nourishes the reader‚Äôs experience with all the history and generations Birdsong encompasses. I do have a caveat. The granddaughter‚Äôs investigation is long and fascinating and difficult. What she discovers adds substance and experience. Yet, it turns out that all she had to do was ask her mother, who knew the essential facts all along, and why Faulk withholds this easily available information until the end can only be authorial manipulation, and it spoiled much of the effect of the ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù for me. Plus the ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù is predictable in a manner that most of the rest of the story is not. The final scene in the book is a complex affirmation of life worthy of its labyrinthian course through violence, despair, hope, and love. As a whole I found Birdsong a moving and admirable testimony to humanity‚Äôs capacity for humaneness. I do, though, wonder what the title has to do with the book.

130,698887845,08/19/2013,4.0,"In 1910, 20-year-old Stephen Wraysford is sent by his employer to Amiens, to observe the practices of the textile industry. While there, he meets Isabelle, and begins an intense love affair.In 1916, Stephen is back in France, this time as an officer in the trenches of warfare, returning to the areas around Amiens - the Somme valley.60 years after the end of the war, Elizabeth seeks to find out more about her grandfather, and his experiences in the trenches.And so this novel is a book of three parts. The first section describes several months in 1910 when Stephen is staying with textile factory owner Azaire and his unhappy, younger wife Isabelle. There are moments of great writing, with Faulks drawing the characters of Azaire and his arrogant neighbour Berard superbly. Some of the other characters, however, don't feel as well-drawn, and parts of the story feel clunky.When the story moves to the trenches, however, the quality of the story-telling makes a substantial change for the better. Though describing some horrific events, Faulks does not veer into sensationalism or mawkishness, but produces a moving account of the First World War, and the experiences and feelings of those who fought in it.Alternating with the story of the war, is Elizabeth's story. Approaching 40, Elizabeth has a sudden need to discover more about her grandfather, who fought I. The First World War. In his introduction to the 2011 edition that I read, Faulks states that 'Elizabeth existed at first to ask questions for the reader and to satisfy a thematic requirement; that the past and the presents the public and the private, be shown to be interdependent'. Perhaps I didn't feel a need to ask those questions, because I felt this part of the story to be somewhat unnecessary. I did not engage at all with Elizabeth as a character, and did not really care about what happened to her. I speed-read through the sections set in 1978, itching to get back to the scenes set in 1916-18. The only moments I felt had any real purpose were Elizabeth's visit to the Somme, and to a war veteran.Thankfully, Elizabeth's story is a small part of the book, and the bulk of the book is centred on the war. I must admit that I have never been particularly interested in early 20th century history, and have not had more than an awareness of events during the 1914-18 war. So I was aware of the high number of losses in the Somme, and the attitude the people 'back home' had towards returning soldiers. So Birdsong, something I read because it was a Book Club read, would or normally have been my book of choice. I am grateful that I was given reason to read it, because of the greater depth of understanding it has given me about the horrors of the war. As well as being moved, I felt angry at times: can anyone not get angry when they learn more about the poor organisation of The Big Push, that lead to completely unnecessary loss of lives? I am glad that I have read this book.",2,-0.9962,0.151,0.792,0.057,0.4620000000000001,NEGATIVE,0.6687
131,1694154090,07/10/2016,4.0,"Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks - Very good, almost excellentI've read a couple of books by Sebastian Faulks and they were, at best, mediocre. I couldn't understand why people rated him. ""Wait until you read Birdsong"" they kept telling me. So finally I have.... and now I, sort of, get it.The story of Stephen Wraysford starts 1910 when he visits the towns on the Somme for business and begins an affair with a married woman. It then jumps forward to 1916, just before the beginning of The Battle of The Somme. He is now an officer and about to lead his men 'over the top'. We follow him through the war and even bring his story up to date by following a descendants discovery of his papers during the 1970s.Now this is supposed to be one of the 'great books', it is listed in the BBC's Bigread top 100http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top...and in the 1001 books you must read before you die http://www.listology.com/list/1001-bo...and in The Guardian's 1000 best novels http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/...and in the BBC Meme: How Many of These 100 Books Have YOU Read?http://www.librarything.com/topic/61828Part of me thinks, rightly so, part not.The sections that cover the war years are truly excellent, well researched, and bring the squalor, fear, bravery etc to life. The pre-war stuff and the bits about the descendants.... nah, mediocre. For me they could have been cut out all together. I know it was there to tie 'our hero' into the landscape, but it would have been a far better book with just the story of one man's war.I'd have quite liked it if that 'one man' had been one of the other characters: Jack Firebrace, a miner brought to the front to tunnel under enemy lines and lay explosives. Some of the most emotive pieces of the book were the descriptions of what went on underground. I have a fear of being in caves/tunnels/mines and I found the writing quite claustrophobic. His was such an interesting character, I'd have liked to know more about him.So, a very good, almost excellent, book but.... if you want to read something better about the war, try All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque or Forgotten Voices of The Somme edited by Joshua Levine. Both bring the soldiers' experiences to life in a memorable way.Read as part of the 2016 Classics Challenge:https://theprettybooks.wordpress.com/...",2,0.9641,0.072,0.807,0.121,0.6118015873015872,POSITIVE,0.7504
132,338634726,05/29/2012,4.0,"I cannot understand why this book was so uneven. The historical section was masterpiece quality, a rendering of the ground and underground campaigns in Flanders during World War I. It was vivid, in human scale but with a gift for suggesting the larger war all around. The tunneling portion was compelling and terrifying, and so well crafted I began to feel the dirt walls closing in on me. Sometimes the writing's power came from mighty understatement, as when a man trapped in a cave must move sandbags to find a way out, and we are told matter of factly that he keeps at it -- in total dark without food or water -- for three days. The ways in which ""the war to end all wars"" marked a turning point in humanity's relationship to its power to destroy -- that is no simple or easy concept, yet the narrative of Birdsong made that idea palpable. The central character's growth from self-indulgent to fearless to nihilistic to determined to live was as engaging as anything I've read in years. And several characters' deaths in battle were powerfully moving.Oh, and the first part is pretty steamy. Really, if the book were only this portion I would be giving it five stars and pressing it into the hands of friends and buying it as gifts.But Birdsong also contains a contemporary section that is of a much lower craft: largely expository, packed with cliche, not vivid in the least. Fortunately it is a fraction of the whole, and I could skim it and not feel the power of the better portions diminish. There is one moving scene in the modern section, when the woman visits a battlefield we have seen in gory times, and she sees a monument that she thinks has been defaced in some way, or perhaps decorated. Drawing closer, she discovers that it is covered with names, on all sides, in every direction. A custodian informs her that these are not the names of men who died in the battle; those people are honored by graves a short distance away. The names on the monument are men who went into this battle and were never found. They are the ones disintegrated by shells. And the names go on and on.But that's it. Otherwise we never end up caring about this woman, her affair, the baby she carries, or her efforts to learn about her grandfather.

I thought it would be a great time, given all the events commemorating the start of the First World War. Perhaps this book just wasn't for me. I haven't decide yet which I think is more likely. But please let me explain why I didn't enjoy a book loved by many others.First of all, I felt a bit cheated at at the beginning. It's said to be a novel of the Great War, but the first quarter of the book takes place in 1910 France. 1910! Years before the war starts. I understand you need to set the scene in peacetime (perhaps) or at least wish to introduce the main character in peacetime. But this is no longer an introduction, this is 25% of the book! Had it been a very interesting 25% book I might have been forgiving, but it's not. It's a sloppy romance and I can't stand them. I was actually just hoping for the war to begin, which says it all I suppose.Then we move forward in time to 1916, and the story of the beginning of the war is very summarily given. Stephen was in France, but went back to England at the beginning of the war to help fight the Germans in the British army, and has since gained some ranks. The part about life in the trenches actually is quite interesting, but the writing felt a bit impersonal. This might very well be because Stephen himself isn't a likeable character and he seems to be detached from all that is happening.Once again I got annoyed when the scene moved to the late seventies and I got information on people who were obviously somehow related (it's easy to guess this correctly) to Stephen in yet another sloppy romance with new characters I couldn't care for either.These last two stories continue to be told in turns, one more interesting to the other, as the story builds to it's climax. But I was just happy to finish the book because I didn't really like the story and the characters annoyed me. All female characters felt extremely flat and without some kind of own vision. And sexually frustrated Stephen wasn't likeable either.

An intorduction to Isabelle Azaire, the wife of Rene Azaire leads to a passionate affair which has repercussions and for reaching consequences long into the future.We move forward to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the enevitable commencement of hostilities and a blood bath on a scale never before witnessed. Wraysford's command is that of a Lieutenant in charge of a small group of ""tunnel rats"". Their function is to infiltrate the German troops by tunnelling underneath their forward line, plant explosives, and in the resulting mayham, offer the allies an opportunity to advance. Given that the same tactic is employed by both sides there is little or nothing to be gained, apart from the inevitable sacrifice of human life.Birdsong is one of the greatest books ever written and it has been a real joy for me to rediscover again 25+ years after it's debut. Not only is it a statement about the futility of war, war is inevitable it is endemic in the human spirit, but it equally it is a love story, the passion that can bind two people together nomatter the circumstances.

135,3722401961,05/05/2021,5.0,"This book is a masterpiece - from beginning to end. It is poetry in motion, a six course meal, the most beautiful landscape in 500 pages. I loved it. Sebastian Faulks is a genius and how he manages to intersect death, love, tragedy, war, reconciliation, forgiveness into one story is beyond me. I feel that this is a book that I will read over and over again and after each reading it will have a different meaning. The plot is simple but yet the themes running through this book make it so complex, intense and riveting. Birdsong follows the story of Stephen Wraysford, a soldier in the British Army who fights for the allied forces from the beginning of WW1 to its end. Prior to joining the army Stephen stays with a family in France and has an affair with his benefactor's wife and later runs away with her. However, she later leaves him and we never really find out why she does. She gives birth to a child but fails to mention this to Stephen when he is later reunited with her whilst he is serving in the army. I could go on and on about each character in this book - for example, I am ambivalent towards Stephen who is a hero but is a deep and complex character with a troubled background. Is it his experiences from the war which shape him or his wish to be loved by Isabelle? Love and war run throughout this book but it is Faulks' mastery that even though these themes are diametrically opposed they still, ironically, have similar effects on people and their relationships. Both bring people closer together and both tear people apart. The characters are complex, their interactions even more so and I feel that Faulks could have continued telling this story for another 500 pages but it is his genius which does not make it feel unfinished. This is the art of literature and Faulks does this brilliantly - I feel that a movie or visual depiction of this story would and could never do it justice. I can only compare this feeling to having a really nice meal and feeling content and satisfied after you have finished - just having eaten enough to remember the meal but not having had too much to feel bloated and sluggish. Literature from the world wars is fast becoming one of my favourite genres for some reason and I'll revisit Birdsong again once I've read the other two books in this trilogy.

Isabelle is secretly pregnant with Stephens baby and she decides to leave him quite suddenly whilst he is out.

Stephen Wraysbury makes an appearance now as an Army officer. The descriptions of the horrors and the fighting in the trenches is just incredible, I literally could not put the book down in places and was entranced and fixed myself in the scene witnessing the full terror of the soldiers.

At times uncomfortable - much like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan - you need to put this book down occasionally to catch your breath. You witness shell attacks, attempted crossings of no-man's land, fighting in tunnels beneath the French countryside, and the dangers of the ever-present German snipers. You also witness the soldiers unwinding when they have time away from the front, you read their letters from home, and you partake in the camaraderie that can only be forged under fire. I have a new appreciation for what those soldiers had to face, and how they fought to hold it together in the face of what can only be described as the unimaginable.I was not a fan of the novel's structure though. The author included a pre-war story, featuring the main character in 1910, and a post-war story, featuring the main character's grand-daughter in 1978. Neither story really added to the overall novel, and the author spent a lot of time going nowhere with them. They felt like stand-alone short stories that were shoehorned into this novel about the War. For what little information that you actually glean about the main character from these sections, the author could have worked this into the main story line. I still don't know why Monsieur Berard's utterly pointless character featured so prominently in 1910, and with the 1970's portions I found myself constantly glancing ahead to find out how long I had to wait to return to the actual story. If the author really felt the need to separate these time periods, a brief prologue and epilogue would have been more interesting. All that being said though, the strength of the main story outweighs the weakness of the (thankfully) short pre- and post-war sections.

Faulks has done a wonderful job in his descriptions of the trenches and the fighting, really bringing home everything the men must have gone through yet leaving you with an understanding that nothing could ever compare to the actuality, that it must have been unspeakably worse.There is an element of the mysterious as Elizabeth searches into her own history, but enough hints are dropped for the reader to know what has happened in the years missed out by the narrative. I liked Elizabeth as she battled with day-to-day life whilst discovering an interest in a war finished decades before and that she'd never really cared about before, and there is a nice feeling to her story that it brings Stephen Wraysford's to a close in a nice 'full-circle' kind of way. Stephen was a character that I felt for rather than liked; his circumstances for most of the book made it difficult to get to know him, a point astutely pointed out by one character towards the end of the book.

I resisted reading it because of the incomprehensible horrors of war with nothing-held-back descriptions of the trenches. Faulks had me so mesmerized with [book:Charlotte Gray|133937 (set in WWII) that I decided to read this WWI novel. The contrived nature of the romance (clearly sexual) between Stephen and Isabelle Azaire (nine years his senior) didn‚Äôt hold up to the vivid war story. There are two narratives: first by Stephen Wraysford, who failed to gain my sympathy, but kept my attention. The second is by Stephen‚Äôs daughter Elizabeth, which didn‚Äôt make sense until I reached the end of the book. Both the sex and battle scenes are graphic and unsettling, but the book is a wonderful account of what sacrifices were made by those who fought in WWI. Especially interesting are the digging of fighting tunnels and the brave men who dug them. The book will both tear your out heart and grip your soul. It helped me understand why my father told us nothing about his experiences in the artillery of WWII.

You'd have to have no heart to turn away from the lessons that it asks of you. Yet it's not a joyful one to me.

It is also a story of survival and the strength of the human spirit and is set in three different time frames: France 1910, France 1916-18 and England 1978-79 and all of these are linked in some way to the central character Stephen Wraysford.This is a beautifully written book but it is not a light read. It is passionate, intense, meaningful and at times deeply unsettling. The horrors of the First World War are brought vividly to life by the author and these scenes are some of the most harrowing I have ever read in a book. It was also fascinating to see the lengths these men went to in order to try and survive the war and how they tried to make sense of and justify the things they saw, the things they heard and the things they did all in the name of king, country and their fellow soldiers.This is one of the best stand-alone novels I have ever read and even though it is a fairly long book at 500+ pages, I could hardly put it down and completed it in less than two days. This is an immensely powerful novel, one that has to be picked up and read to be truly understood and believed.

You cannot help but feel overcome by the stark choices that were forced on the boys in the front lines, the guilt of those who survived, and the fear yet gratefulness of those in the tunnels.

The idyllic beauty of the French countryside (with a minor disruption here and there from unions) is enhanced with the passionate romance between Isabelle and Stephen. The tension between them is captured beautifully by Faulks...and their end is just as poignant. Faulks shows Stephen's capability for both love and loss. His humanity is completely torn from him during the war. The horrors soldiers faced not just from the enemy, but from living in trenches with the constant fear and degradation of being more animal than human was horrifying. By also following the miners, Faulks adds the real terror the men faced both above and below ground...even when they managed to grasp some humanity from the men around them, they were almost all killed, leaving the survivors behind with only terrifying memories. When the novel skips to late 1970s London--commemorating the 60th anniversary of the armistice--it takes on a completely different tone. Chasing the past, Stephen's grandaughter struggles to make a connection to him. I didn't really connect with her character...it was hard to leave the emotion Stephen evokes and transfer it onto this new voice.

After a few happy months, Isabel abruptly leaves him, with no explanation. This part of the novel was just ""meh"" for me.

They say that this war was so much more terrible for the combatants than other wars (although all wars are hell). This book helps the reader to understand why. Despite the author's semi-detachment to his characters, those scenes make you really feel for all the soldiers, not just the main character. Perhaps the detached writing style was necessary in order to help the reader stomach the war scenes.By the end of the novel, I found myself hoping Stephen would live and likewise, hoping he would die, thus ending his misery.

However, the entire subplot involving Elizabeth should have been cut. I understand that the idea was to demonstrate the connectedness of multiple generations, but it wasn't terribly effective and could have been done more effectively through the character of Francoise, and in a manner more immediate to the main action.

191,801935910,12/27/2013,5.0,"Birdsong, by Sebastian Faulks (1993) Birdsong is a very gripping, good story. It has sold three million copies worldwide, the sort of figure which makes me think twice about what Faulks was trying to achieve with it; my premise being that top quality art and a very wide audience are usually mutually exclusive. Dickens is for me the ultimate example of the writer who never compromised on his art in order to sell books.Birdsong is essentially a story about a European man, who, like millions of others, gets caught up in the First World War. It‚Äôs the story of his survival - not of his fight for survival, but almost of his involuntary fate of surviving. Call it luck, call it the gods in their absurdity playing with the fate of a man who actually had far less reason or will to survive than countless others who perished. It is a gripping tale of life in the trenches, graphically punctuated with the grime and gore and inhumanity of the war, the main trait of which is surely, put plainly, the collapse of civilised humanity and the suspension of historical progress in any positive sense. For many who survived the war, their lives were nevertheless over after what they had seen. In the book, the men agree that if there was hope for the future, it could only be for their children, once it was all over ‚Äì it was obvious to everyone that the war itself was senseless, had no positive purpose, the men were all reduced to an existence conducted at the lowest common denominator of life, namely an obdurate and expressionless feat of endurance. The endurance of something unbearable, and that was their heroism: to hang on and somehow believe in a time when Europe could and would move forward again. Clearly hundreds of thousands of the European men who fought in the 1st World War witnessed the lowest depths to which humanity could fall, the indifference to bestial conditions and the necessary acceptance of the mechanical killing being the worst aspects. Truly the indifference to the horror which they had to show outwardly was a pretence which was necessary in order to keep a grip on the sanity needed to survive. Stephen talks not of a will to survive, but of it being the very nature of war to make it impossible not to survive if one could. It wasn‚Äôt that he wanted to live, although he does speak of being interested in how it turns out (but not in who ‚Äúwins‚Äù, nobody could win) and the lengths to which humanity would go in that particular situation. Not that there wasn‚Äôt kindness and loyalty and comradeship, there was, as evidenced by the jagged friendship that formed between Stephen and Weir. But in friendships there was danger: since friends could at any moment be obliterated and leave you grieving, which in turn was an additional burden, most men did not form friendships. Comradeship and friendship were strictly separated, friendships generally only evolved if both men were sure they were going to die, as illustrated when Stephen and Jack are trapped in the damaged tunnel towards the end of the book. But perhaps the paradox of life is forever there: there is no reason to live, but you do anyway, and nowhere is this clearer than when men are caught up in a terrible war.But Birdsong is more than just an anti-war tract. It is about the history of 20th Century Europe (a favourite theme of Faulks). We meet Stephen‚Äôs granddaughter, who is a middle-class British woman living and working in 1970s London. Her mother, born in France, strangely knows very little about her father (Stephen), although he took an active part in bringing her up (which I though was a bit loose, plot wise) and so Elizabeth starts trying to find out more about him. She finds encoded diaries at her parental home and tries to contact men who knew her grandfather. The ending (which I won‚Äôt reveal) is, I think, an attempt at showing that history can be fulfilled, resolved, rounded satisfactorily, and that the chain of human experience (he uses these words) is very difficult to break despite humanity being seemingly determined to destroy it with wanton and bestial acts. I‚Äôm not sure the ending works for me, I found it a bit forced and twee, as indeed was the feeling I got whenever the leitmotif of birdsong arose. There was a little too much rather na√Øve symbolism there for me. Though to be fair, at least it (the birdsong, which arose repeatedly at moments during the narrative) wasn‚Äôt too obvious, as symbols go. It wasn‚Äôt a symbol of peace or anything as trite as that. It may have been to do with the idea that there is a subliminal but ubiquitous seam of nature that is thoroughly joyous and honest and true and that despite the unnatural acts and horror that humanity perpetrates and commits, we can‚Äôt destroy it. Humanity does continue after the war, and even during it people still live on, and even fall in love. Once the war is over, people experience joy and purity again, above all (for Faulks) returning to brotherhood in order to build a new continent, in socio-political terms. In accordance with this seam of nature, Elizabeth loves a married man because of who he is to her (and these feelings are returned, and it doesn‚Äôt seem wrong that he is married, because neither of them can stop themselves from loving). This is highlighted when another man outrageously and presumptuously proposes to her on only the third occasion he meets her. Although he is single and ‚Äúeligible‚Äù, Elizabeth doesn‚Äôt hesitate a moment in rejecting him, though she is actually more astonished than outraged at his behaviour. Robert is the man for her, married or unmarried....On July 1, 1916, on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, during the infamous Allied offensive described in Birdsong, there were 57,470 Allied casualties, 19,240 of these were dead. Most were massacred in the first hour as wave after wave clambered courageously but hopelessly out of the trenches to be wiped out by German machine gun artillery, who, safe on higher ground and in barbed wire encircled trenches, had simply been waiting for them to come.The First World War killed about 750,000 British soldiers and injured another 1.7 million, meaning that nearly half of the six million conscripts returned dead or injured. The war and its aftermath claimed up to 16 million lives if the at least 8 million victims of the typhoid epidemic and famine in Russia from 1918 to 1922 are included, millions more were crippled. Eight million European soldiers perished. About 750,000 German civilians starved; Germany lost 15% of its active male population. There is speculation that the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-20, in which at least 50 million people died worldwide was exacerbated and accelerated by conditions caused by the war (massed malnutrition coupled with the increased mobility of the population). These figures shocked millions of Europeans and must have hardened their resolve to change things from their roots - although the 2nd War barely twenty years later obviously interrupted that process. Faulks is aware of the revolution in thinking that these calamitous events caused in the development of Europe as a political continent. It is no exaggeration to say that the nature and extent of the war changed Europe forever. Four empires collapsed, the Bolshevik Revolution was hastened if not precipitated by a mutiny in the Russian navy, the European Union would surely not have come about if it had not been for the collective resolve (finally, after the Second World War!) to achieve continent-wide peace and prosperity brought about by healthy trade between nations to replace petty, isolationist nation-bound rivalry for the benefit of the landed gentry. In the novel, the idea of European unity is hinted at by the fact that Elizabeth‚Äôs lover works for the European Parliament in Brussels. It is no co-incidence that Faulks, as a Francophile himself, creates his main character with roots both in England and France, and that one of the main French characters in the novel ends up living with and nursing a German soldier. The scenes near to the end of the novel involving Stephen, who is still in France when the war ends, and the German soldiers (including a Jew, whose brother is killed by Stephen‚Äôs attempt to get out of the tunnel by dynamiting the blockage) are deeply moving in their reconciliation and symbolic return to the values of civilised humanity. Europe had to get to this stage in order to mature (in fact, in order to survive) and it did succeed in doing so. Faulks is a barrister by background, and a journalist by profession (he left The Independent newspaper in the early 90s to become a full-time writer). The Independent was and is an important institution of British journalism which he had worked for since its inception a decade earlier, first as literary editor and then later as deputy editor of the Independent on Sunday. One of the founding tenets of this newspaper was and is the belief in Europe as a political entity, at a time when this was quite a radical concept in Britain (this is no longer the case, despite what the gutter press prints). I believe it was Faulks‚Äô intention to dig into the sub-strata of European history and explore the vital period of the early 20th century, 1918 being a hugely important watershed for Europe. It is widely believed in Britain, for example, that the spur for the inception of the welfare state, unthinkable in the 19th century, was the feeling that Britain in 1918, as Lloyd George put it, had to become a land ‚Äúfit for heroes to live in‚Äù (meaning: for the returning soldiers).Another aspect of the novel is the incredible military tunnelling work that went on beneath No Man‚Äôs Land in France and Belgium (I am resisting the temptation of seeing these descriptions as a symbol of Faulks‚Äô digging around in European history!). It is an almost incomprehensible concept: men digging miles of tunnels under the fields in order to spy on and fight each other. To the eyes of the observer nearly a century later this is an utterly absurd and futile activity ‚Äì what on earth was the purpose, in ultimate terms, of this? The symbolism of the soldiers‚Äô emergence from these tunnels at the very end of the war after the fighting has ceased, so close in the narrative to Elizabeth‚Äôs giving birth to the boy called John, is unmistakeable, if, dare I say it, a little overladen with ‚Äúhidden‚Äù meaning for my taste. But I am snobbish, and Faulks wrote for a newspaper that more than anything else embraced ideals of European unity at a time when the British were still ignorant and hostile to these ideas. In my view, such ignorance was, and in some cases still is, a consequence of the fact that no fighting ever took place on British soil. Many British soldiers‚Äô sense of isolation and alienation at the end of both wars had its roots not only in the horror that they had seen, but also in the fact that virtually no one ‚Äúback home‚Äù had any idea about the nature and scale of what had really happened in the killing fields of Europe. Jeanne, the French woman who takes care of (and eventually marries) Stephen is depicted as an enormously understanding soul, and this was surely only possible because she had been so close to the events. Mainland Britain experienced hardship, but no horror. And the horror truly was unspeakable, unrepeatable. Stephen utters not a single word for two whole years after the end of the war.There is much more to this novel than meets the eye ‚Äì it is more than just a gripping tale set in WW1, and I think about its scenes and implications a lot as a British citizen living in Germany and with children who are at home in both of these countries.",0,-0.9988,0.15,0.738,0.112,0.4110944641607624,POSITIVE,0.9998
192,3088570387,12/29/2019,4.0,"This was a great book, and I can totally see why it would get 5 stars. It was really well-written, it didn't feel too drawn out, or too constricted, and the imagery of war was especially evocative. The frequent descriptions of the claustrophobia of being in the tunnels, to the horror of seeing a friend's head getting blown off by a machine gun, even to the almost irrational fears Stephen has of the canary, they all felt so real and I had to stop reading at a few moments to make sure that all my limbs and body parts were still in place. It made for a harrowing, uncomfortable, but necessary read.As much as this might make me seem like a slightly cold-hearted bitch, the only thing holding me back from giving this the 5 stars it probably deserves is that I didn't feel as moved by it as much as expected. Honestly, it shocked me too but, aside from a couple of moments, this novel didn't quite connect and I, as much as I tried to, could not feel that invested in Stephen Wraysford and his life. I think part of this might be due to the addition of the later timeline (view spoiler)[in the 1970s in the last third or so of the book. I could feel myself start to feel more for Wraysford, and it felt wrenched away when we're introduced to Elizabeth and her role as his descendant. I'm not too sure what the intent was with this aspect but I wasn't the biggest fan of these sections  (hide spoiler)]. I will say that the parts that moved me were poignant and heartfelt (view spoiler)[ especially when the deaths around Stephen just felt more and more desperately sad, from Byrne, to Weir, all the way to Firebrace  (hide spoiler)]. I also began to understand the role of Stephen's dalliance with Isabelle by the 70%ish point, or wherever Jeanne makes an appearance. I think it allows us to see the contrast between his ways and his life prior to war and how impactful it was on him in its aftermath - most strongly through showing his all-consuming passion and love for Isabelle.This has made me want to read much more historical fiction, which isn't something I tend to do. I'm just having a quick look through my 'Year in Books' on here and, apart from Ivan Denisovich, which I read specifically for a class, the multiple historical romances I read which aren't exactly the most informative or accurate (as much as I love them!), and Ruta Sepety's  Salt to the Sea which I did like but didn't feel too attached to, this was comparatively a much better and more touching read (even though, as described earlier, this hasn't quite hit me in the heart with feels). I've had a quick google search of other books set in this time and, hopefully in the new year, I'll get round to reading classics like  A Farewell to Arms and  All Quiet on the Western Front.

194,4259838748,09/27/2021,1.0,"Like a few others who have put up reviews about this book on here, I‚Äôve had to study this book for literature A-level, and ‚Äôll be honest: the writing itself isn‚Äôt that bad. But this book includes themes that are both unnecessary to the plot and that make the main character, Steven, very unlikeable, which makes it very hard to actually enjoy 2/3 of the book, and on top of that I cared very little about the last third and the characters it concerns itself with. In the first few pages, Steven wasn‚Äôt that bad, but within the first two chapters I just began to hate him. I understand that Faulks wanted to sorta liberate the female characters in this text and bring to light their struggles within a 1910s society, but certain plot lines like Isabelle leaving her rich husband when he‚Äôs her only financial support, blatantly stating her affair to his face, and a bunch of other shite that happened with her character was so unbelievable and genuinely not likely to happen at all within that time period. Faulks failed not only in making Isabelle‚Äôs liberation arc believable, but in general somehow made the struggles of the 1910s women worse by obsessing over the violence committed against them. For starters,the stuff with Lisette? Why? Maybe a 20 year old man groping a 16 year old girl being romanticised would be believable and somewhat overlooked in an actual 1910s text, but Faulks as a writer from the 90s had no actual reason to put that in and it served no purpose to the plot. What really pissed me off after that was how Steven decided to tell Isabelle, Lisette‚Äôs step-mother, and it‚Äôs described as arousing her??? The overall intimate parts were terrible and even though they were written to liberate Isabelle etc they just did the opposite. I‚Äôd rather just have read an actual 1910s text that excluded the terrible and weird ass sex parts. Fgs steven has an oedipus complex and he‚Äôs also super forceful on Isabelle, not uncommon for the time period but the way it is romanticised by the author makes it super weird. Also the threatening a prostitute with a knife was super unnecessary. Maybe I‚Äôm just bias because I hated Steven, but the overall plot was underwhelming too and Faulks‚Äô writing didn‚Äôt make up for all the weird shit he put in there.

195,2854321062,06/20/2019,4.0,"Birdsong is a novel consisting of several arcs that alternate between the passionate tryst of Stephen Wraysford and Isabella Fourmentier, the inhumane, destructive spoils of World War I, and a woman whose curiosity is piqued after reading an article about the anniversary of the Armistice. Stephen encounters Isabella during his tenure at her husband's house. The other invited guests display gross, ostentatious personas that he strongly dislikes. Stephen is described as a dispassionate character, whose distant facade conceals a barely suppressed emotional volatility. Isabella, an elegant trophy housewife possessing a quietly willful streak, is equally attracted to him, but is frightened by what their encounter beholds. Still, they carry on with their affair, and finally elope, causing a social uproar. Isabella soon discovers that she's pregnant, has second thoughts, and secretly returns to her sister's house. Stephen doesn't hear from her again, until much later, when he meets her sister Jeanne by accident. In the meantime, Stephen is crushed by Isabella's abrupt departure. After enrolling into the army during World War I, he finds his emotional and physical fortitude pushed to the extremes. The war scenes are described too well to a disturbing extent. The soldiers end up becoming grotesque playthings of flesh, as wave after wave of them are killed. The remaining soldiers have to relive the horror of waking up every day to an uncertain fate. As the soldiers forge strong bonds over battles, women and the brief respites of rest, they are aware of how laughingly tenuous these relations are. Even when they return to their homes, they find themselves isolated by their unwilling burden, their minds suspended in the fight-or-die response of war, tired beyond breaking point. The ones that do survive harden themselves emotionally to survive the physical and emotional onslaught, but this repression inevitably becomes traumatic. Brennan, a WWI veteran, lives out much of his entire life incoherent, his mind forever frozen in the early 1910s'. This is my first Faulks novel and it's written in an obsessively microscopic, yet curiously detached manner. I'm not yet sure how to feel about this, although it's a solid work on its own merits. The nearest feeling I could come to is a fascination? ",0,-0.9955,0.199,0.71,0.091,0.4787957211870255,POSITIVE,0.6384
196,3480453140,12/02/2020,3.0,"This book was so promising at first - extramarital passion in an early 1900s French village? Yes please! But after Part I (of VII) it very quickly and completely became a war novel. There are war novels and then there are novels that use war as a setting to explore and amplify other themes. This is the former, with most of the book detailing gruesome WWI trench warfare. It also has moving depictions of the psychological effects of war. I just don‚Äôt happen to want to read about it. That‚Äôs not the book‚Äôs failure. A more objective miss for me was something that I often complain about - the contrived use of alternating past/present storylines. My issue with this device is that, instead of two equally developed stories, one (usually the present-day storyline) inevitably is a throwaway to help move along the past story. That proved to be the case here. The bulk of this story takes place before and during WWI with protagonist Stephen, interspersed with flash-forward sections revolving around his granddaughter. These modern-day (well, circa 1978) interruptions felt unnecessarily forced and lacked real character development. For example, we never got a good sense of Elizabeth or why she suddenly feels a compulsion to learn about her grandfather and his time in the war. Moreover, why did she call up random senile old men who possibly served with Stephen when her own mother, with whom she appears rather close, had all relevant information that she easily shared with her over one pleasant lunch and by digging out old journals from the attic? The story would have been better served without the Elizabeth modern-day portions. Then Faulks could have used the freed up pages to better develop some characters who danced around the main frame but never materialized as real or complex, e.g., Jack Firebrace or Jeanne. On the plus side, this book had a couple of the steamiest scenes I‚Äôve seen outside of a romance novel.

I'm sure i had dreams about those trenches and dugouts and tunnels. It was so well written and loved all the characters. I loved especially of how raw the WORLD WAR 1 was described and also the thoughts of those soilders. About how they can never be normal or lead a normal life. About how back home nobody knows about how the war was about the lives of these soilders and all the cruel things they face every single day and how they a traumatised by the things they see that happened to their friends. How nobody will ever know. And what actually kept these men going all those years with their life sucked out of them. God! Got quite heavy there at a time. Told in different timeframe with 3 generations with heartbreaking stories of erotic love, passion friendships i think this was a great book. What I didn't like: The narration kept losing the main characters. The characters that we were getting to know and caring for. At one point there were no main characters. There was only war.

But I don't think I have ever read a more moving account of life on the battlefield.Very early sections of the novel reminded me of Jane Austen. There's something about the way Faulks sets up the domestic life in Amiens, France in 1910. Like Austen, he shows how individual personalities and social station can influence behavior, in a way that is illuminating and entertaining. As the action heated up in the first section, the passion and romance felt like Ian McEwan's Atonement. (Lots of reviews of this book mention McEwan.) But that's just the beginning. The war scenes make this novel into one I would recommend not just to my literary-minded friends, but to anyone. Faulks is able to give dignity and grace to the individuals who experienced and perpetrated some of the most horrific acts of war on the planet. There's a scene in the novel that takes place on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. On a hill above the battle a group of characters view the carnage below, and each witness is fundamentally changed by the experience. I think maybe that's the best way to describe this novel. It fundamentally changed my understanding of the experience of war. Not sure if I can conjure up any higher praise than that.Give it a read.",0,0.8051,0.109,0.734,0.158,0.5189153439153439,POSITIVE,1.0

It's hard to know what to say about this book, in any case, it's all been said already. I was hesitant to make a judgment on it due to a) my complete lack of knowledge of WWI and b) my lack of knowledge of what those who went through the war would have thought about the book. Some light research has reassured me of the accuracy of the depictions and the realistic nature of the book & now I can let myself truly feel the value and impact of the writing. I teared up and felt dizzy at moments reading the graphic scenes of this novel, the writing really is extraordinarily vivid and touching. I had to remind myself throughout that this was not WW2, fictions and films and plays of which I'd grown up with, but something totally separate and worthy of artistic probing its in its own right. The first part could have been shorter and the book could have dove into the war sooner I think, once that happened I was gripped. Then again, I don't feel confident saying any part of this book was unnecessary or less important than the war scenes even if it feels that way, because all of it works together to make it the book that it is with the impact that it is.

No history book, no movie will ever truly capture that or be able to justify man's inhumanity to man in any conflict. Faulks does a superb job of taking us from the easy, carefree, pre-war days in France to the stinking battlefields in the same country a few years later. His graphic, straight-forward descriptions left me grasping for answers, searching for reasons, wondering, like the soldiers he described, what it was all for. Perhaps Elizabeth Benson sums it up best in the story, when she is overcome by a simple war memorial and says, ""Nobody told me. My God, nobody told me.""

The much revered love story between the two main characters of the beginning, was less to do with love and far more to do with lust, as was the rather pathetic relationship between Elizabeth and her lover. The descriptions of the horrendous conditions of the trenches were vivid and could be gripping and there was some emotional purchase in the decline of the men afterwards, but I was left wondering whether the book was meant to be about the horrors of war, the too quick to forgetfulness of human kind, or?????

He successfully recreates a forbidden love affair in pre- WW1 France. He pulls off sex scenes without sounding ridiculous -no small writerly feat. They are interesting and have the ring of truth about them. The depiction of World War one battle and the bureaucratic grind of trench warfare, especially the tunneling or mining crews was also nonpareil. They had a claustrophobic effect that also somehow echoed and underscored the overwhelming feeling of the constant fear of death. Again an excellent part of a somehow dissatisfying whole. The rendering of the scenes of the 70's, as a central character tries to reconnect with her grandfather's history during World War One, were less engaging, but again appeal as a masterly writer's effect.

258,1283656151,05/18/2015,5.0,"The programme of events commemorating the centenary of World War 1 has triggered interest and heightened awareness of what is often referred to as ‚Äúthe forgotten war‚Äù, and we all wish to extend our appreciation of such momentous events. ‚ÄúBirdsong‚Äù (1993) is, of course, a work of fiction, but it is the product of extensive, detailed and original research. Faulks immersed himself in the time and the events that characterise it. In so doing he has been able to bring insights that seem authentic to a story line that compares and contrasts the vagaries of human nature when confronted with horror. Above all it gives you a sense of what it must have felt like to fight in the trenches.Some of our group had read Birdsong some time ago and had re-read the book in order to refresh their memory. They all found added benefit in the second reading, uncovering depth in the characters and their contemplations, and wider themes in the book.There were differing views of the ‚Äútime shifts‚Äù otherwise described as ‚Äújump cuts‚Äù. Some thought it worked brilliantly, drawing out the contrast between untroubled pre-war life, the wretchedness of war itself and the transition to post war reality, and embodying his wider themes about time and the generations. Others thought the time shifts ‚Äúa bit clunky‚Äù and ‚Äúirritating‚Äù, particularly the shift to the 1970‚Äôs.There was a general view that the first part of the book that deals with Stephen‚Äôs life in Amiens, staying with the Azaire family and having a passionate affair with his host's wife Isabelle, was a bit too long. One person was tempted to stop reading at this stage; however, all were sufficiently encouraged by the description of the steamy sex to carry on reading.The jump from peacetime Amiens to the Western Front in 1916 was a surprise and a shock to all, with the stark contrast between the love affair in the peaceful countryside of northern France and the horrors of the Somme. This narrative technique worked well throughout the book, and was greatly appreciated by all.It was mentioned that Faulks deliberately imitated cinematic narrative devices, ‚Äúmoving from unbearable close ups to a view on a long lens and a very wide shot‚Äù. This thread permeates all parts of the novel, and was particularly effective when deployed in linking time, building characters and in dealing with themes such as life and death.Death is an ever-present theme. The scale and arbitrariness of death, and the impact on individuals and their families and comrades are topics that are especially well portrayed. The impression is given of fleeting contact with individuals, insights into their lives followed by descriptions of their deaths, sometimes casual and sometimes in graphic detail. It was suggested that the death of comrades in some way helped to secure a closer bond between those remaining and to unite them in a common cause.The group admired Faulks‚Äô descriptive powers in relation to the scale and nature of death:‚Äúbodies were starting to pile and clog the progress‚Äù; ‚Äúexplosives can reduce men to particles so small that only the wind carried them - men simply go missing‚Äù.Stephen‚Äôs granddaughter, Elizabeth Benson, on visiting a cemetery near Bapaume in the Somme, felt that ‚Äúon every surface of every column as far as her eye could see there were names teeming, reeling, over surfaces of yards, of hundreds of yards, over furlongs of stone‚Äù.One of our company particularly liked Stephen speaking to Gray regarding the attack on Beaumont Hammel ‚ÄúI looked in your eyes and there was perfect blankness‚Äù, and following the attack as darkness fell the movement of the wounded was described as ‚ÄúIt was like a resurrection in a cemetery 12 miles long‚Äù.Most of the group agreed that the strongest and most memorable sections in the book for them were those concerning the 1st day of the Somme offensive and those describing the underground warfare. The seduction of Isabelle in Amiens was also admired, but the reasons for the end of the affair remained a bit of a mystery.There were mixed views on the sections dealing with the 1970‚Äôs. Some considered them a bit contrived, particularly the coded diaries, while others thought them well structured and entirely appropriate given their purpose to suggest that time heals, that hope arises out of despair and that life goes on.The group was surprised to learn that Faulks had written the book in only 6 months. It was his fourth novel and by far the most successful. It was the unanimous view of the group that ‚ÄúBirdsong‚Äù is a great modern novel‚Ä¶.This is an extract from a Monthly Book Group review at: https://monthlybookgroup.wordpress.com/ Our reviews are also to be found at http://monthlybookgroup.blogspot.co.uk/",0,0.9952,0.076,0.785,0.139,0.5399090909090909,POSITIVE,1.0

Not in a positive way.I haven't read any other book by Sebastian Faulks and I don't think I want to after reading this. I don't know what Faulk's obsession with affairs is but it's prevalent in this book as it keeps cropping up. The two main relationships that this book fawned were both affairs. As if Stephen's affair with Isabelle wasn't enough, the book then jumps to the 80s ,from the 20s, to focus on Elizabeth's boring life as she tries to find out more about her grandfather , Stephen. Her affair with a married man did not have to be included... It wouldn't have made the book any better or any worse or give the story more substance; it was just really unecessary.The book starts of with Stephen going to France and staying with the Azairs on a business trip, he ends up having an affair with Isabelle, they elope, she gets pregnant and moves to her sister - away from Stephen and then World war I breaks out. Stephen goes to fight there and the book carries on with Stephen's life in the army. It then suddenly jumps 60 years ahead to focus on Elisabeth who tries to find out more about her grandfather (as I said, Stephen). She also chases around a married man who lives abroad most of the time and doesn't really care about her. She ends up getting pregnant by him and then the story ends after she'd given birth. Oh, and, sorry for the spoiler. I'm still pissed that I wasted a week reading this book even though it's been ,about, a month. But, it really was a terrible book. Also, the writing was just incomprehensible, I felt myself getting lost most of the time while reading it. For example, there was this really shit simile (I don't remember exactly) but it described Isabelle's stomach pain while pregnant; 'felt like a knitting needle with a walnut along the shaft was stabbing her'.

Some books just hurt too much, touch at places which go beyond the reach of words. But I was a bit agitated today, and writing kindda helps me calm down. So here I am. Most of it might just come out as lot of blabbering, so bear with me please. ‚ÄúThey were in their own view a formidable group of men. No inferno would now melt them, no storm destroy, because they had seen the worst and they had survived.‚ÄùAs I started reading, I was promised a love story, not without its fair share of heart ache and falsehood though, but I was soon thrown into war. I felt trapped, because, no matter how many aches are a part of a love story, it is never as difficult to absorb as a war story. Not that I didn‚Äôt know it was coming, but no matter what you do, you can never prepare yourself for the blow that is headed your way. ‚ÄúThey had seen things no human eyes had looked on before, and they hadn‚Äôt turned their gaze away.‚ÄùHave you ever felt helpless because you have loved and lost? How would you feel if you know you have a child but for years you were unaware of her existence? That feeling of helplessness is so gut wrenching and soul thrashing. Isn‚Äôt it? Have you ever suffered identity crisis? When you have no soul in the world whom you can call your family or friend. You feel utterly lost? Don‚Äôt you?‚ÄúI saw the great void in your soul, and you saw mine.‚Äù But life is full of tragedies that are far worse than a mere heart break at the loss of a loved one. And hence we are acquainted with the survivor‚Äôs guilt our protagonist suffered after coming out alive of a war that completely put him out of touch with reality, and transformed him from the person he used to be before it. ‚ÄúThey were frightening to the civilians because they had evolved into passive beings whose only aim was to endure.‚ÄùIronically suffering was not for those who died. Because most of them didn‚Äôt suffer. Their souls left their bodies within seconds. It only crept up to those who were left behind. Left behind to see once living breathing humans now turned into scattered pieces of meat and pools of blood. The gory images of human brains splashed around, half face men, where rest of the face had been blown up by splinters of shells, one human body over another piling up like rotten meat or merely shattered into so many pieces that it was hard to differentiate between dust and human. But nothing will shock you while you are reading it. Because till the time you finish reading it up, you would become as numb and insensible to pain as the protagonist. You will feel lost, but nothing like Stephen, who couldn‚Äôt utter a single word for two years. Because he had already lost connection with the so called normal life, a life he didn‚Äôt recognise any longer, after facing four years of grotesque war imagery where men died left and right but he kept surviving because he was just that lucky. But was he really? ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not the details of life I‚Äôve lost. It‚Äôs the reality itself.‚ÄùAs Faulks help us walk through all the suffering, it felt like I could see it all through the eyes of a person who might have seen it himself, endure it through a heart which has the pain pierced through his own. For that how captivating the prose of this book is. There are no big soliloquies uttered in pain, there are no long paragraphs describing human suffering. It is just small sentences here and there, which would leave you stunned for few seconds, before you could gather enough courage to read the next line. ‚ÄúSomething had been buried that was not dead yet.‚Äù",2,-0.9942,0.183,0.692,0.125,0.5346119929453264,NEGATIVE,0.8627

276,236711053,11/17/2011,3.0,"Birdsong is a 1993 novel by Sebastian Faulks, about Stephen Wraysford, an orphan cum clothmerchant cum homewrecker cum infantry officer perpetually stationed in the line alongside a tunnelling corps. Focuses primarily on the tunnelling corps and their activities, with the obligatory couple of trips ‚Äòover the top‚Äô for Wraysford.I was initially disposed to like this book. The preface impressed me with Faulks‚Äô thoughtfulness about his characters and how the story would set up point and counterpoint between the characters and time periods. There was also some interesting content in terms of the section set in Amiens before the war, and particularly around the tunnelling company‚Äôs activities.However, despite this good start, I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy Birdsong. Ultimately I think I enjoyed this book so little because it was fundamentally character-driven, with several wishy-washy plots that meandered around and ended when the novel ended, not because they‚Äôd found their natural conclusion. The plotline of Wraysford‚Äôs granddaughter discovering his diaries in 1978 was particularly weak (she read like a throwaway character, and the plot relied on melodrama).It probably isn‚Äôt fair of me to hang my criticism on this point, since it is partly an issue of taste not quality; I am a genre reader consuming everything produced about an era which seems primarily to inspire ‚Äòliterary‚Äô writers concerned with character study, c.f. Pat Barker‚Äôs Regeneration. I think more recent writers have taken their cue from the memoirists such as Robert Graves and Vera Brittain in terms of the type of story and style of narrative used - hence all those shell-shocked officer heroes. But whereas Graves, Brittain, Sassoon, Remarque, etc, were drawing from life, Faulks and Barker draw from a caricature of life based largely on a monochrome myth of WWI and life in the trenches. I don‚Äôt doubt Faulks‚Äô research, or the authenticity of what he writes, but Birdsong offered me nothing that other authors hadn‚Äôt done earlier, and better.One thing that particularly irritated me was the relentless, one-eyed proselytising about the Horror of War. Some of this is to be expected, but it is constant. Wraysford, according to the preface, was supposed to be created as a man with the characteristics that would allow him to get through the war more-or-less intact. Although Wraysford ‚Äòtalks the talk‚Äô on this, his actions show him as falling into the aforementioned standard shellshocked officer type. Again, I am not objecting to the realism; I just don‚Äôt think Birdsong offers anything that other authors haven‚Äôt done better.There is also nothing wrong with preaching the Horror of War. But whereas Wilfred Owen or Erich Maria Remarque show it to us, Faulks tells us all about it, then tells us how we should feel about it. For example, upon seeing the Thiepval memorial to the missing of the Somme, Wraysford‚Äôs granddaughter sinks to her knees and whispers, ‚Äòwhy did no-one ever tell us?‚Äô.Ultimately, to anyone thinking of reading this, I would suggest they read Robert Graves‚Äô Good-bye to All That instead.

This literary tour de force is a powerful read in the sense that you find yourself stopping to catch your breath and containing all the overwhelming emotions the magnificent tapestry of words evoke. Faulks is a magnificent storyteller, narrating not just the atrocities of war and the flaws of humanity in the face of violence but as a whole creates a story that resonates hope amidst the horrors, an enduring kindness amidst the cruelties of man, and new beginnings bridged by future generations which know no bloodshed became an enduring force for survival. A poignant account of war spoken against the backdrop of the essence of humanity- a test of faith among the believers, and a solace and purpose for those who found no refuge in living. It raises the questions to what extent can war push soldiers further against the core of humanity and integrity and if there is a ceiling, or if that ceiling continues to go higher as war demands them to become cold-blooded killing machines automatically programmed to hate. In the face of it all, this novel paints a picture where hate is not the most extreme lengths a person stripped of their humanity can go, but that of becoming a person whose only emotion shows indifference and submission to nothingness.  At the same time it expresses a continuous and unwavering belief in the inherent goodness of man, as personified by Jack and Margaret Firebrace in the story. While the story also highlights the star-crossed love affair of Stephen and Isabelle, I believe that what made this book special was Jack Firebrace's devotion to his son and wife.",0,-0.9064,0.164,0.697,0.139,0.6648170011806376,POSITIVE,1.0
278,324489271,05/05/2012,5.0,"What a fantastic novel. I freely admit that I only picked this up because I found the recent PBS miniseries based on the book to be compulsively watchable and hoped that the source material would be half as good. Turns out, it was in many ways considerably better and certainly more intense. The book is subtitled ‚ÄúA novel of love and war‚Äù and that‚Äôs how I think I‚Äôll divide my thoughts on it. It is initially and perhaps most importantly a love story. Wraysford and Isabelle‚Äôs affair is as passionate as it is brief and Faulks writes it with such conviction that you believe it implicitly. He manages to run the gamut from the most restrained suggestion to the frankly explicit while retaining a gorgeous, literary style. It‚Äôs funny to me how simple and natural it is to cheer for adultery in so many great novels when it makes me feel so sick in real life. Isabelle‚Äôs husband is probably too conveniently and perfectly awful, but it does save me from uncomfortable moral qualms about their behavior. And while they have their moment in the sun, this isn‚Äôt a paperback romance novel, so things go wrong and Wraysford is left devastated and confused. Which brings us to the war part of the story. I feel that I can‚Äôt be alone in saying that the First World War seems to be routinely glossed over in every history course I‚Äôve ever taken, in favor of the glamour and popularity of WWII. I wonder if it might be because even at a distance of nearly a hundred years, the utter waste of it all is just too jarring and incomprehensible to really dwell on. There don‚Äôt seem to be any tidy moral lessons or inspirational moment as abound with WWII; there was only the carnage of mechanized warfare fought with foolish, untenable strategies of an earlier time. I loved this story for bringing it alive in blood and dirt and horror soaked reality. The author‚Äôs descriptions of the trenches and the endless, soul-crushing terror of the front lines are the best I‚Äôve ever read on the subject. The most fascinating thing was the way the men became numbed to the sight of constant, cheap, and horrifyingly gruesome death. The psychological truama of it all is impossible to get one‚Äôs mind around. They all dealt with it differently - Weir drank his nerves and anger into submission, Grey hid behind a sort of patriotic blindness, Firebrace clung precariously to faith and family, but Wraysford was the most interesting. He simply endured. There was his grim curiosity about seeing the war through, if only to see how much further the preverseness and depravity of the war could be taken. There was his fading remembrance of Isabelle and the more immediate, though less passionate, love of Jeanne. Most of all, though, was the elemental desire to simply keep on living even though he didn‚Äôt know why or what for. This was so very, very good. The writing is beautiful, the romance is exciting, and the war is devastating - it has it all. I‚Äôd very much recommend it. ",0,0.9401,0.158,0.644,0.198,0.576779448621554,POSITIVE,0.9994

I watched BBC TV series ""Birdsong"" first, and I was completely overawed by the beauty, the intense emotion, the truth they revealed from their souls and hearts... I was thinking I must read the book. Before I got the book, I watched the TV series 3 more times.Some books stay with you after finishing the reading. Birdsong is one of them. Stephen Wraysford, the main character became so full and vivid and human as the war went on. Faulks kept saying he was strange, and I know Faulks didn't mean he was strange strange. His strangeness only enhanced the deep, emotional, intense affection he had buried in his heart. As he told Jack, ""I think she (Isabelle) was my own flesh and blood. I truly believe she was."" It was heart-breaking to see the pain he had hidden and suffered, and the despair in his being. The despair.Stephen's strangeness is unique, is almost profound, no, it is profound. That's why we love him. Eddie Redmayne played him so well in the TV shows, his rather distant gaze, the ready-to-disappearing grin... For a long time, I believed Eddie Redmayne was Stephen Wraysford, yet toward the end, I saw the full Stephen, with some gray hair, tall, lean, and deeper silence.I am so happy Stephen met Jeanne, and Jeanne loved him and was married to him. I am not so happy Stephen only lived a short life. But that's the cruelty of wars, no one can elaborate it and make it less cruel and grim.I have never read any books that describe war as detailed and horrific as this one did, but I believe it, I believe WWI was just like that if not worse. I can't believe how much one could endure. Stephen and Jack were stuck underground in the tunnel for days, Stephen miraculously survived. Only hope and love could have made him last that long, yet he was exhausted, ""his body and his mind were tired beyond speech and beyond repair, but nothing could check the low exultation of his soul.""I had waited for Jack to say that line in the TV show before he died: ""Nothing more, sir. To love and to be loved"". But it never appeared in the book, I guess it was added in by the screenplay writer, which matches Faulks' style perfectly.The TV series left out the modern life in England entirely, which I thought necessary. I didn't see any point of Elizabeth's existence until the very end when she gave birth to a son, the dramatic childbirth, and when she said, ""I know. It's...John."" I was weeping.I am not sure why the boy's name is not Stephen but John. To memorize Jack's son? To fulfill Stephen's promise to Jack?I don't know if Faulks was emotionally drained after he finished this book, I was after I read it.

Wraysford's life is viewed through several shifting perspectives: the men under his command, his granddaughter investigating her family history from 1978 London, and of course from his own inner narrative.At first I found the sudden narrative shifts a little disconcerting, but once I was able to locate Wraysford in each new context I found the plot was actually quite tightly written and always pulling the reader to discover more of Wraysford's life. Birdsong makes for an intense, oftentimes harrowing, read. I'm reasonably well versed in WWI history, but I was still quite shocked in parts by the sheer degradation of human life that Faulks depicts. This novel is a perfect example of how narrative can be far more effective at conveying history than mere statistics and bald facts.There's a detailed development of themes here, too. Like most art forms concerned with war there's meditations on life and death and how brutality of war renders life utterly meaningless. There is also quite a bit of emphasis on the disjunction between the experiences of soldiers and civilians and how difficult it was for the former to resume the life of the latter. But what I really liked was that Faulks (if imperfectly) tries to steer the reader towards some kind of reconciliation of the horrors of events like the opening day of the Battle of the Somme, with somekind fo hope for humanity. As Wraysford searches for a reason to go on surviving machine guns and bombardments, Faulks is also trying to find a way in which he and the reader can understand the history of WWI and not be consumed in an existential vacuum. I think whether he succeeds is probably a very personal matter of interpretation, but I had sympathy with his depiction of the ongoing, cyclic flow of humanity and the way the modern world sort of carries the torch for our ancestors.This was one of the most poignant and touching novels I've read in a long while, and despite the bleakness of the subject matter, there is something very satisfying about the way Faulks closes the circle and concludes his story.

It is extremely rare for me to give a book five stars, but while this novel isn't perfect, it deserves them. I'm going to say something anyway, but you can ignore it -- just beg, borrow, or buy a copy of this book and read it. Why on earth it didn't win, or even get shortlisted for, the Booker prize I'll never know.It starts out as a defiantly 19th-century novel, reminiscent of Flaubert. No plunging the reader into the action or attempting to arouse curiosity, the first page is a description of a dull suburban street in Amiens! This first section describes the passionate affair between lonely Englishman Stephen Wraysford and the wife of his French host, a few years before the First World War. Faulks' writing is so vivid and sensual that this is utterly compelling despite the fact that ""nothing much happens"".We then skip ahead to the war, and much of the book is taken up with s brutally realistic description of trench warfare. Sometimes I felt Faulks went a bit far with his no-holds-barred descriptions of dragging decomposing bodies out of shellholes, seeing men with their brains dribbling out of their eye sockets -- but it's above all about the reaction of Stephen and other soldiers to extreme stress, as well as a testimony to the appalling inhumanity/insanity of which human beings are capable. Yes, there have been other books and memoirs written about this, but this moved and angered me more than any book since Vera Brittain's Testament of Youth.This novel is about characters, not plot -- Stephen is a real person, with real thoughts and feelings, real flaws, and you are completely absorbed into his experiences. The description of the attack on the Somme, and all of the last 100 pages, are compelling -- you can barely breathe as you read.Inevitably the 1978 interludes with his granddaughter Elizabeth finding his notebooks and discovering more about him were less successful. I couldn't believe that Elizabeth could be so ignorant about this war and of course her daily dilemmas were a lot less interesting.

285,17256804,03/07/2008,,"The start of this book, in which Stephen is a guest in Isabelle's house, did not immediately grip me and I found it slow going. I did not enjoy the explicit scenes between him and Isabelle's, although they seemed better drawn and less gratuitous than is usually the case. I found that I enjoyed the book far more after the change of narrative to the Great War. This, I found very moving and beautifully sketched - it truly brought the realities and horrors of the war to life for me. I was less interested in Elizabeth's life, but in some ways her narrative served to heighten the differences between the normal civilian life so many men had fought for, and their lives and deaths while fighting it.The account of their first attack was terrible: the fake assurances made to the men and the ludicrous tactics adopted (such as attacking in daylight). Worst was the relentless march of men trudging on only to be gunned down before they had barely left their trenches - only to be followed again and again by waves of men knowing the fate of those before them but doomed to step forwards into death nonetheless. The role of the sappers was new to me, and the tunnels so vividly depicted that I felt quite claustrophobic just listening to it. The eventual rescue of Stephen by German soldiers was a relief, but seemed a little too pat; every time something happened it was hard to take it completely seriously because it never seemed that the main character would actually die. His most unlikely rescue coinciding exactly with the armistice was symbolic, but too coincidental for my liking. Overall, a book that had me thinking deeply and awakened in me an interest in that period of history. I now know much more about the events of the First World War than before reading this book, and am keener to learn more.

I loved this book, for all its flaws and for all my lack of real interest in its protagonist.When I was reading the first section (approximately one hundred pages, prewar), I wrote of it: ""Faulks cites a number of nineteenth-century French authors as influences, and Flaubert in particular is evident in this book--and not just because of its early setting (France) and subject (adultery). It's very sensual, very attuned to physicality, and very involved with the way that convention wars with romanticism. The prose itself speaks to that contrast: often formalized, restrained, but just barely covering the narrative surge beneath.""But it was, unexpectedly, in the descriptions of men at war that Faulks came into his own. The staging of the night before the Somme in particular was brutally effective, and the relationships between the soldiers were compelling. Faulks did his research, too; perhaps sometimes a little too obviously, since there were moments when I felt as though I was reading

There was, after all, a front cover rave from Simon Schama's New Yorker review and a back cover notice that it was ""#1 international bestseller,"" along with more rave words from the NYT and LAT book reviews. But from the first page, I knew I had to be mistaken. The writing was too wooden, too awkward, for the kind of regard I had in mind.

The Now story is set in 1978 in London and follows 30-something Elizabeth Benson, an unmarried career woman with a married lover and a mother sporting the very French name of Francoise. Beyond the awkward writing, my major gripe with this book is one I have with many novels nowadays: At 482 pages, it's simply too long. The tedium and unspeakable horror of the trenches does not have to be re-enacted on the page to get the point across. A handful of well-written scenes could have made the point more bracingly, but Faulk's endless reiteration wound up dulling my outrage at the seemingly endless and utterly senseless atrocity endured by the trench warriors. The Now story moves along much more briskly, but I found Elizabeth to be a very cold character, one who interested me clinically but didn't grab me emotionally.

The story begins with a bit of a love story when Stephen goes from London to France to learn the textile trade. Meeting a woman named Isabelle, he falls in love. Fast forward a bit to 1917 and WWI and we find our young hero, Stephen, fighting the Germans in the trenches in the French countryside. Firsthand I learned the ins and outs of trench warfare where young men were sent to march forward and forward bravely while bullets and mortar threatened their tender lives.

After the horrors of war and the things the young men see and do, society, love and life is never the same. It's so very hard to connect with anyone else when you've been through it all.Even though this book has a dash of love and a lot of war, it's a tender story of a man who was orphaned when young and led a wandering life and a strong will to survive and to perhaps, feel love again.While the mortars are going off during WWI, Stephen's granddaughter in the future, is searching for him and trying and find out more about him as the story unfolds. His notebooks are all she has to go on and they are in secret code which has to be cracked if she is to know anything about this mysterious man whom she never met.

Then there‚Äôs some secondary or tertiary business with the contemporary granddaughter who is trying to discover and understand something of her grandmother and grandfather.

292,4550076988,02/14/2022,2.0,"Sometimes a book can be condemned purely by association. Birdsong was a book that was nominated among the greatest books of the twentieth century, and even had a programme dedicated to it. Unfortunately the choice of presenter advocating the book was former Conservative party leader, William Hague.Hague is remembered (if at all) as the Tory leader who was easily defeated by Labour, and later held a cabinet position in which his main achievements were‚Ä¶well, I can‚Äôt think of any. I best remember his leadership campaign which was based on opposition to the European single currency. There were good reasons for not signing up to the euro of course, but Hague seemed to think it was enough to hold up a coin with the Queen‚Äôs head on, and say ‚ÄòLook at it!‚Äô in a misty-eyed way. Only a Tory would imagine that people would get sentimental over currency.Of course it may be unfair to judge Faulks purely by his choice of defender, as there have been many great works by writers of conservative leanings. Even Shakespeare had a book written about him by our current Tory PM.Still the very name Sebastian Faulks (both forename and surname) suggest someone of posh upbringing. I was not too surprised to see that his brother was a Tory minister. Faulks does seem to have worked for The Independent, a pseudo-liberal newspaper that has some good intentions. He also appears to have added his signature to a newspaper letter where various people called for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Of course everyone is allowed an opinion on the subject, but to sign something that amounts to a petition to oppose another country making its own autonomous decision hardly reeks of progressive thinking.None of this tells us whether Birdsong is any good, but it sets up some of the background for how we might imagine Faulks feels about the issues in the book. Birdsong is essentially a war book. It is concerned with the First World War, as experienced by a number of the soldiers, one in particular. But is it a pro-war or anti-war book?By way of digression, we may well ask whether any story about war is not automatically both pro-war and anti-war at the same time. The anti-war book cannot help making war look exciting. Even the more gruesome elements of an anti-war book are not much different than the more gung-ho pro-war books.It may seem strange to imagine any book as pro-war, since war is felt to be a bad thing. Still there are books that glorify war and fighting, or which defend a particular war. Pro-war stories more often come out during a war as propaganda, but can be offered in peacetime by people wishing to praise soldiers and their role in a war.Still the pro-war story cannot help being partly anti-war. The fighting is gruelling. Decent soldiers die or suffer horrible injuries. Leaders and even the soldiers on the ground are forced to make terrible decisions that raise ethical problems.Before offering my verdict on Birdsong, it might be necessary to say what it is about. The main character in Birdsong is Stephen Wraysford. In the first part of Birdsong he is in France, which is where most of the book will be set.Stephen is staying with the Azaires, a middle-class family. A strike is taking place among industrial workers, which will not end in victory for them. Azaire is determined to see the workers accept poorer conditions. This is only the backdrop to a more personal event. Stephen has an affair with Azaire‚Äôs wife, Isabelle. He briefly persuades her to leave her abusive husband, but the pregnant Isabelle decides to return to him.The rest of the book is divided between two time zones. During World War One, Stephen is an officer who witnesses much slaughter and appalling conditions. He briefly gets to see Isabelle once more but she is now committed to a German officer. Meanwhile in the 1970s, Stephen‚Äôs grand-daughter Elizabeth is investigating her his time during the war, whilst also getting pregnant with a child that is the product of adultery, though in this case she is seeing a married man.The sections in the 1970s are less well-liked by readers, and with good reason. Not all readers are convinced by Elizabeth‚Äôs character. The more serious problem is that they break up the narrative concerning Stephen, and give us irrelevant accounts of how he will be viewed many years later. We may see this as being about the reconstruction of history, if we like. If so, it rests on an optimistic belief that the past can be reconstructed as truth.I would have happily dispensed with all the 1970s passages but that is not to say that I am enthusiastic about the earlier part of the book either. Faulks gives us the thoughts and feelings of his characters, and yet I never really had a strong sense of their personalities. They seem colourless.Indeed Stephen has very little personality. He is kind and compassionate in his way, but also impassive and lacking any warmth. No wonder Isabelle went back to her husband. While Azaire is not a nice man, she does at least have a warm family to help bring up her child rather than the distant affections of Stephen.This aloofness applies to Stephen‚Äôs relations with the world at large too. He observes the striking workers, but does not interest himself passionately in their grievances. He is horrified by war, but never loves the soldiers and treats the war as if it is a game, an experiment in how bad men can get under pressure.Perhaps something of this dispassionate nature comes from Faulks himself. Faulks is vaguely sympathetic to the strikers, as long as the hotheads are excluded, but he does not seem especially concerned whether they win or lose.There is a similar attitude towards the suffering of the soldiers in World War One. Faulks portrays the sufferings and horrifying deaths of the soldiers in graphic detail, but there is no real sense of outrage. Indeed so many gruesome tales in one place is desensitising. I cannot remember any individual awful detail in Birdsong because Faulks piles the horror stories too high.What I feel when I hear such stories is compassion and anger. Anger at the leaders who forced so many young men to lose their innocence, limbs, lives or sanity just to defend a few vested interests at home. Perhaps even anger at the soldiers for allowing themselves to be manipulated into prejudiced attitudes against others based on a few arbitrary national boundaries, themselves decided by war. It is absurd to hate the Germans as if they are not merely the same as the British, another collection of soldiers misled into bigotry against their enemy in order to serve the national interest of a small number of people, none of whom are fighting.That perspective is missing in Faulks. He sees the pity and sadness of war, but does not question its necessity. The sacrifices may be appalling, but this does not cause Faulks to see anything wrong with the cause of so much pain.

293,1193757914,02/07/2015,2.0,"This book has been attempted by me many times over the years; I think I first started it when I was 15 and I couldn‚Äôt seem to get past the first 100 pages, but finally I have achieved the impossible and finished the book!To be honest, at 15 I think I was a little young for the book, not least because of the explicit sex in the first 100 pages, but also I didn‚Äôt know much about WW1 until my A-levels, where I had to study a range of WW1 literature, as the battlefield descriptions and the tunnels can get a little confusing. Anyway, as an adult it was okay, I think it would‚Äôve been better if it concentrated on the war, Wraysford‚Äôs soap opera back story didn‚Äôt really help me connect to him and I preferred Firebrace even though we were only told about his ‚Äòlife‚Äô back home through letters and recollections. What really, really annoyed me was the 1970‚Äôs interludes where an idiotic woman cipher, a supposedly successful businesswoman, suddenly decides to investigate WW1 for no apparent reason, later vaguely relating her quest to an absent grandfather and wanting to feel ‚Äòconnected‚Äô. These bits infuriated me, not least because it felt like Faulks was treating us like fools, in a ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to make WW1 relevant to you blah blah blah‚Äô way. I don‚Äôt consider myself an idiot and I have enough imagination to realise the tremendous sacrifice made by all involved that I don‚Äôt need a present day cipher reducing it down to an unemotional ‚Äòwho do think you are‚Äô exercise. I would‚Äôve liked an actual account of what happened to Wraysford, and for it not to be revealed in the reported drivel of the most uninspiring woman in literature.So the war bits are ‚Äògreat‚Äô in a harrowing way, rest of it pure drivel.

294,47213189,02/22/2009,2.0,"Another of those books I thought would be better. It started out strong. But then it kind of died. I mean, when all those quotes talk about OMG WHAT AN EPIC LOVE STORY!!! and the love story cannot even touch the hem of epicness, something is wrong. I checked to see if all the review blurbs were from men, but some women apparently also fail to know what a real love story is (hint: it‚Äôs not a torrid love affair That Society Disapproves Of followed by the woman leaving the man when she gets pregnant and hiding the baby‚Äôs existence from him and never seeing him again and Jesus Christ, I realized I just described the (not really romantic) romance in Possession as well! THIS IS A HORRIBLE PLOT LINE THAT SHOULDN‚ÄôT BE USED ONCE, MUCH LESS TWICE!!!). Ahem. The plotline of Stephen/Isabelle‚Äôs daughter was pretty pointless. Also, she was dumb. Her comments about WWI and how shocked (shocked!) she was that battlefields could be in cities and not just on fields made me wonder (1) if she had ever been to school (2) if she was brain dead. And her affair with a married man (the fact that he had a wife was his responsibility, not hers!) did not make me like her any better. As to the WWI part, which is why I think this story gets so much attention...it‚Äôs okay. Stephen is pretty much dead inside by this time, and it also causes the story to feel a bit dead. And there‚Äôs a lot of jumping around in POVs and I‚Äôm sorry, but I just could not keep track of the characters, especially since they kept dying, so it was really hard to care about anyone (Stephen I hated for most of the book, but sadly he lived). There are far superior war books out there (Cold Mountain, for one, handled war and its effects much better, though I hated the female POV in that one).

295,186321530,07/19/2011,5.0,"Having just finished this much recommended book I am still reeling from its impact. It was a struggle to read. Not the early chapters set in Amiens before the war where the ill-fated love affair between Stephen and Isabelle races away. No, in those early chapters I turned the pages avidly, but then came the chapters in the trenches,down the tunnels and into the razor wire. It was in one of the tunnel scenes towards the end of the book that I completely understood Stephen's tenacity and bravery as a soldier. As a reader who shares Stephen‚Äôs bird phobia, I physically felt his torture when capturing the canary in the tunnel. As I read ...‚ÄúThe small canary suspended from his mouth made feeble movements and its yellow feathers protruded from the handkerchief to brush softly against his face. He closed his eyes and pushed onwards. He longed for the mud and the stench, for the sound of shells (p. 306)"" my heart raced and my breath quickened, a true nightmare.So it‚Äôs taken me a while, not because I wasn‚Äôt absorbed by this incredible work of historical fiction, rather because it was too real, too ugly, too horrific. The horror of this war was depicted so graphically that my night time reading was put aside for something lighter and less likely to induce nightmares. For the past couple of days I‚Äôve devoted some daytime reading to finishing Birdsong. I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs over. Quite often great stories are reduced by their conclusion but not Birdsong. The ending is, in my opinion, perfect. It echoes back through the decades fulfilling a promise made in the trenches, while the reader is left to imagine how the characters lives will resume. Five stars from me. Tragically memorable.",0,-0.9445,0.149,0.742,0.109,0.5175697865353037,POSITIVE,0.9463
296,378216793,07/27/2012,3.0,"3.5 Stars...With Birdsong Sebastian Faulks brings the reader right into the trenches of WWI. We are going over the wall, walking senselessly towards the enemy and watching our friends get blown in half or jerkily dance to the impact of bullets. We are covered in lice that we burn in the seams of our clothes with matches for entertainment. We are wet, cold, terrified, claustrophobic. We are emotionally numb from the sheer volume of dead bodies surrounding us. Birdsong has some incredibly powerful wartime stories and although the book claims to be about Love and War, be prepared that it is mostly about war. Fortunately, those are the strongest sections of this book. The descriptions on the tunnels and the team who went from digging the London Underground to digging the tunnels in France was fascinating. While it's not always easy or enjoyable to read about war, it was definitely an education that I appreciated.When the book is about love it is much less compelling. Stephen Wraysford meets an older married woman and without a lot of discussion, they fall into bed (why do these kinds of stories always revolve around awakening a frigid woman to the joys of sex). This relationship creates a thread through the rest of the book and leads to some brief ""modern day"" chapters about a woman researching her grandfather's WWI past. These chapters didn't ring true for me and seemed to take away from the gritty realism of the battlefield but I suppose they give the book a reason for telling the story and give the author a way to eventually sum up Stephen's future for the reader. Overall I found this book uneven. I never felt very connected to the characters but the war segments were compelling and worth the effort.",0,-0.4604,0.085,0.824,0.091,0.5164862914862917,NEGATIVE,0.9876
297,33499167,09/22/2008,4.0,"Birdsong tells the story of a young English man Stephen Wraysford, who goes to France on business a few years before World war I and has a passionate affair with his boss‚Äôs wife Isabelle, then when the war starts he enlists. Even in this early part of the novel, the other characters are more extreme and fleshed out than the hero (antihero) .It took me a while to get into his character, but over the course of the book through his relationships with the tunnellers, and memories from his childhood we get a better picture of the man. The scenes set in the trenches, are horrific and show the effects on the men as they become detached to death. An interesting aspect of the story was the tunnellers whose job was digging the tunnels under no-man‚Äôs land and laying the mines. The character Jack Firebrace, who leaves a wife, and dying child in London I found very moving, his relationship with Stephen starts with Jack being court martialled and ends with them fighting for their lives in a tunnel. The intense friendships of the men who live so closely in awful conditions, contrasts with the rather cold character of Stephen. A lot of reviewers dislike the later section dealing with Wraysford‚Äôs grandaughter in 1978 searching for clues to her grandfathers past. I thought it was ok, as it showed how her generation knew practically nothing about World war I and the scene where she meets with an elderly WWI veteran whose mind was still replaying events was very affecting. Overall I enjoyed this book and found the last third riveting, I suppose on the whole, this book is about love, and the human will to survive against hardship.",0,-0.8689,0.116,0.789,0.095,0.4566091954022988,POSITIVE,0.9999
