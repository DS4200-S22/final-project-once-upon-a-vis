It's great to see how Rowling keeps outperforming herself with each new book .

Rowling Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during protagonist Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury, and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries.Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, with his Death Eaters kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy. \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u067e

I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn\u2019t have been willing to admit in college that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she\u2019s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it\u2019s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain\u2019s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don\u2019t know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort\u2019s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (\u201cmuggle\u201d in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother\u2019s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the \u201cmuggle\u201d blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents\u2019 death.With Dumbledore\u2019s help in exploring Voldemort\u2019s past, Harry begins to understand that he\u2019s come to be where he is through the choices he\u2019s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that\u2019s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?", "num_likes": 222, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1.Harry_Potter_and_the_Half_Blood_Prince", "book_id": "1", "book_title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/567096841", "review_id": "567096841", "date": "Mar 21, 2013", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "user_url": "/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "text": "I could revisit this world over and over!!

Well, deep or shallow, it's the truth. I waited a long time to read the Harry Potter books because I wanted to experience them with my own children. My son (8) and I just finished the sixth book, my first daughter (6) and I are working on the first, and my youngest child (3) is content to commandeer her siblings' wands and run around shrieking, \"I have a Harry Potter stick!\"In other words, we all enjoy it.I could write a great deal about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but it's a tough book to write about without giving things away. And though I loved this novel for many reasons, I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales. This, I think, speaks to J.K. Rowling's ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh.So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel, please know that there might be spoilers below. Not huge spoilers, mind you, but I'm always afraid of letting something slip. So...be forewarned. Don't read on if you haven't read this book yet. And if you haven't read the book, why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don't yet approach J.K. Rowling's? Seriously. Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series!Some delights and terrors and sorrows...1. Fenrir Greyback: Bet that surprised you a little. I know that this character played a relatively minor role, but on the page he was a scene-stealer, a flesh-chewer, and a perfect foil for one of my favorite characters, Remus Lupin.An aside: About a year before I began reading the series, my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization. The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books. One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads, which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin. She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me, as if seeing me anew. She then said, \"Mr. (Insert real name here). You sort of remind me of Lupin.\" When I later found out he was a werewolf, I was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). But when I really got to know the character, I found the remark incredibly gratifying.Back to Fenrir Greyback (with whom I hope I have nothing in common)...What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior, but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort's ambition were compared with Jack's (the leader of the hunters), then Greyback would be Roger, the sadist. This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. Greyback doesn't want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. I don't know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any), but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers.2. Fleur's Surprising Reaction: I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here, and I feel awful about it. But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires (Ron's particularly), and though she was skilled at wizardry, she wasn't an especially affecting character. She did seem affected, however, and when she showed up again in Book Six, I, like Mrs. Weasley, rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery, vapid future supermodel.How wrong I was.One mark of a great writer, I think, is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. That's J.K. Rowling. When something terrible befell Fleur's fiance, I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue.And I loved that. So here's to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. People can still surprise us, and we need to give them the opportunity to do so.*takes a deep breath*And lastly...3. Dumbledore: If you've read this far, you've only been assailed by minor spoilers. I don't want to spoil this plot twist, but I don't know how to talk about it without spoiling it. And the fact is, I don't want to talk about it.Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has. In the first book he was wise, eccentric, and a constant source of comfort. As the series has developed, he has persisted in exhibiting those traits, but he has also grown more than most might think. He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. He has admitted how fallible he is, how prone to mistakes. He has been injured, accused of wrongdoing, and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper.And he has come through it all with an open, caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. One passage in particular, I think, summarizes this amazing character for me. In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry's resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis:\"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can---\"\"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\"\"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\"\"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means---love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\"Yes---just love,\" said Dumbledore.The above passage will strike some as too direct, too naive, or worst of all, too emotional.It struck me as incredibly beautiful. There are all sorts of belief systems in the world, and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. But what Dumbledore says here is something that, were it adopted by more people, would alter our world for the better. Harry, for all his flaws, usually acts with good intentions. He befriends Luna Lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction), gives of himself to others, and is willing to suffer so that others won't have to experience the same pain. In other words, Harry loves.And so can Dumbledore. Which is why this book was so memorable, wonderful, and painful to me.I'm going to go now. My wife is making a delicious supper. My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle. And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick.And for that, J.K.

'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' \nI'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over.*takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book \u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\nPHLEGM\n I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD \nRon and Hermione\nI ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. \nHarry And Ginny\nhave you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book  'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... \nDumbledore's death\nI admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!

I was rolling in laughter! by Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness & the unique fun in the writing style, the impression, the descriptions, the comparisons.anyway, don't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me.3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & after that shocking end in book 5, looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end...in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading it. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.)& don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books.Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio)Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying many times. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him.)yelling many times:Don't!No!you idiot, Harry!because he is my favourite character...\ud83d\udc94(though now after many times re-reading, I actually found funny parts too, thankfully)at the end, he was right though.also, lack of funny sarcastic verbal fights between Harry & Draco :(almost whole events were like side-jobs; like the Slug club.truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his students... ughhhh. Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at an immediate, solid grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't on solving mysteries (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) or something as intriguing as these. they were just attending classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff.but in total, other parts (except Malfoy & Slug club); maybe not high peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was funny & the parts with Dumbledore was fascinating.I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action!But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!', therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite.BUT....on the bright side, there are parts I love too:\u2764 sassy Harry was the best!There's no need to call me \"sir\", professor. Bless you JKR!Bless you Harry Potter!one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass masters!my first reaction when I see this, was: \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & then re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down (\"Hail Harry Potter!\") & burst out laughing!\"Well, you can\u2019t break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!)\"I\u2019d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!\u201dalthough there was no sarcastic comebacks between Harry & Malfoy, but this book had many funny moments by other characters.Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic, but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable.Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke with laughter!\"and I'll take his secret to the \u2014\"  \"\u2014 not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\"LOL a lot!\u2764 FriendshipsHarry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books.\"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\"  \"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ll \u2014\"  \"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I!?\"Roonil Wazlib!also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books.\u201cListen, Hermione, I can tell it\u2019s not a girl. I can just tell.\u201d\u201cThe truth is that you don\u2019t think a girl would have been clever enough,\u201d said Hermione angrily.\u201cHow can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?\u201d said Harry, stung by this.I actually noticed after years of rereading, now Romione has lowered in its place for me & I ship these two much more. they care so much for each other.(I'm thinking it's also a brotp for me too. well, it's complicated to decide if I want to accept the canon (because I do love canon too) or my mind. the point is, I love the moments with these two together :)\u2764 the writing style is just Unique & perfect & funny!\u2764 my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them.I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore.I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom.& how he unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters.\u2764 at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"Harry looked around; there was (view spoiler)[Ginny (hide spoiler)] running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart.The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\"(& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :(\u2764 & I was proud Harry became (view spoiler)[Team Captain (hide spoiler)]!Quidditch were funny, especially the first one (You Clever Harry! XD). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;)\u2764 Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicate she chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears, I love it, it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.)Hail Queen!10th read; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it (still things that annoy me) so I probably won't.

If you\u2019re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn\u2019t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends:https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.)God, how do you talk about this book? It\u2019s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life. For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ll just come out and say it: I\u2019m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He\u2019s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I\u2019m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can\u2019t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.I\u2019m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don\u2019t like this at ALL.Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He\u2019s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents\u2019 legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he\u2019s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages.I didn\u2019t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn\u2019t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book.Also, I\u2019ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He\u2019s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn\u2019t last very long. Anyway.I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she\u2019s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry.Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone\u2019s favorite character? He\u2019s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh.Harry and Ginny I\u2019m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU\u2019RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks.Speaking of supposedly-good characters\u2019 downfalls: I\u2019m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don\u2019t count. Harry and Hermione\u2019s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that\u2019s who I am, and she\u2019s annoying in this book. AND IT\u2019S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE\u2019S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again.Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he\u2019s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren\u2019t here nearly enough. The price of Harry\u2019s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I\u2019M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I\u2019d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.)But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it\u2019s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It\u2019s such a gorgeous setting and I\u2019m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I\u2019ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I\u2019m really going to miss this series. I\u2019ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it\u2019s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I\u2019m rereading it after 10 years, it\u2019s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS.Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else\u2019s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead.

With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world. Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times. Some spoilers follow. Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies? If you are one of such rarities, stop right here!!! Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial. My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry. Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add? Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry. Another complaint is fairly big and I will use spoiler tags for it. The underground lake scene: (view spoiler)[this came out really stupid for me. You had to drink the liquid to get the locket? You could not just reach it with you hand, fine. You could scoop the water with a goblet? Why not pour it out instead of drinking?

So all the nitpicks aside I still rate this book with a perfect rating; it is well worth it. P.S. I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series; this feels like a good place: when it comes to movies, Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.

I cannot remember enjoying this book as much as I did now. I actually thought this was one of my least favorite in the series but now I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s actually one of my favorites. I liked this book much more than the fifth and read it much faster. I have no idea why but I found many parts in this book funny. I laughed a lot more than usual when I read Harry Potter books. This book was perfect and amazing in every way possible. My second favorite character in the series is Draco and in this book, I felt so bad for him. He probably wouldn\u2019t have gone off to the dark side if his dad wasn't there first. It was obvious that he and his mother didn\u2019t want to follow Voldemort. When he hesitated to kill Dumbledore and was considering taking his offer of leaving the dark side I felt so bad for him. Also in the bathroom when he was crying really made me feel sorry for him because I don\u2019t think he would be all rude and mean if it wasn\u2019t for his parents and the way he was brought up. Harry and Ginny. To me, they should have never been a thing. I have always hated Ginny and the fact that Harry starts to like her annoys me so much. I hated her from the beginning and I have no idea why. I always wanted Harry with Hermione and not with Ron but my ships always crash. But then again Hermione is way too smart for Harry and Ron. Harry being with Ginny slightly rubbed off on me after re-reading this book, but keyword being slightly. Although, I still don\u2019t like Ginny and I don\u2019t think I ever will. I always disliked her since the beginning and I also don't think I will be completely okay with them together. This book proves that Harry Potter is an idiot and there was a reason he was never put in Ravenclaw. I mentioned this in my review of the first book but one day my friend and I were talking about HP and she told about how Harry is so dumb. First of all, Snape has been teaching him for 5 years. 5 YEARS yet Harry wasn\u2019t able to recognize his handwriting. I cannot understand how Harry could not pick it up. I mean Snape had been his teacher for 5 years and was writing in front of them yet Harry couldn't put two and two together. Hermione probably could have figured it out but she never read the book. Does he not pay attention at all? I mean you\u2019d have to never listen or read anything in class to not pick it up.After he finds this book, which has spells written around it, he thinks it's perfectly fine to start using them. This book obviously belonged to someone who was a dark wizard but yet he sees these spells and thinks \u2018oh nothing bad should happen I mean this book only was written by someone who was interested in the darks arts\u2019. Then he decides to test a spell on Draco and he doesn\u2019t even know what the spell does. I get Draco was trying to torture him with the Cruciatus Curse but there are still other spells he could have used to stop him. Then he tries to convince Snape that his nickname is Roonil Wazlib. Obviously, Snape won't fall for that. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love this series and I do like Harry but he is so stupid.I enjoyed this book a lot and found it really funny. I feel like reading this book made me love the series more and I\u2019m not sure if that was even possible. I wish after finishing the series I can erase my mind and re-read the series. I am so excited to carry on even though I know what happens next. I want to wait for a little before carrying on to the last book because I don't want to finish re-reading the series.

Harry is more at ease now that the wizarding community believes him. I mean yes, there were still some terrible things going on, but things are now sort of calm at Hogwarts.

The stillness that accompanies sitting with your own thoughts during the countless rest days is painstakingly growing on me, so I needed something to look forward to, other than the many family-talks speculating about what's ahead.I'm giving myself permission to sidetrack first into a bit of a backstory, given that this book did the same with its\u00a0rather long \"Previously on Harry Potter\" starting point,\u00a0catching the reader up on the 411.Back in late 2014 -\u00a0THE year I started reading Harry Potter for the first time and the same year I promised myself I'd finish the series - I made the hefty mistake of picking up the fifth book, \n  \n    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n  \n, from the library on its own right before Hanukkah, meaning that the sequel wouldn't be available for another week. I then dutifully devoured the fifth book by day two and convinced my mom that the only thing I wanted, nay needed, was the sequel, which I promptly completed in time to take the finale from the library.(Spoilers: I finished the series with two days to spare of 2014 in which I also finished\u00a0To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u00a0to provide me some of that lightheartedness, as I mention in my review.)I personally had a rocky start with reading the series. The first book took me multiple times to pick up and complete; it took me months of what I usually read within a week. I remember now really getting into the series with the fourth and fifth book, though I can't recall now which works better in my favor.\n\n    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n  \n\u00a0is probably my favorite because I'm a sucker for dreams and nightmares being interpreted and taken seriously. The minute you start paying attention that's when you start seeing more clear signs that can easily give answers to your own personal situation.This sixth book seemed promising to me, as well, because of\u00a0the Pensieve and its many memories we dive into. This is the only way to do flashbacks... especially given the unbiased perspective to these unfolding events, like getting an introduction into Voldemort's family line from someone employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\u00a0and then slowly piecing together bits of information through the many reveals.But before all that can happen, the book starts off where Harry feels most at peace: The Burrow. I love me some good ol' family dynamics with the Weasleys (and being a united front against\u00a0Phlegm\u00a0Fleur).\u201cWell, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.\u201dHarry is slowly starting to view Ginny as a safe haven; she represents all good and safety in the world for Harry, which he desperately seeks with the upheaval that is his own life. I laughed when my mind associated Harry's choice of Ginny Weasley with that scene from Parks and Rec with the Saperstein twins:\nHarry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince\n  \n\u00a0centers on the more obsessed-like state of Harry with Malfoy, Hermione sulking away from Won-Won, Roonil Wazlib making a mighty comeback, the frustration when no one believes Harry's valid suspicions, and so much more which I feature\u00a0below in my favorite points:\u2022 The sly insert when Slughorn dismisses Ron's name with:\u00a0\u201c...after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\u201d Clearly, filming for the Harry Potter series was well underway.\u2022 This particular book in the series feels like the inspiration behind Baz and Simon in Fangirl (and Carry On) what with the slow-moving plot till the characters arrive onto school grounds, and the aforementioned nemesis-watching from afar and following their every move.\u201cLevi sat back, hugging the pillow again. \u201cThey are kind of gay, aren\u2019t they? What with all the watching each other sleep\u00a0\u2026 and the ignoring Penelope.\u201dI'm personally not into the whole Draco/Harry ship, given Draco literally smashed Harry's face in just because (this ruthlessness is what's so vivid in my mind, so much so that the hurt of that scene traveled through back four years when I first read it and I felt the exact same shock) and also the simple fact that Draco Malfoy is a terribly cruel character. Those types need to stray far, far from humans until they acquire some anger management tools. He's basically a reincarnation of Snape (the only reason they get along) what with all the sulking and pettiness (Snape with Lily, and Draco with his need to acquire power). Just because you've marked a certain person/goal as \"MINE\" in your head doesn't make it so it's yours. So the author trying to make me feel sorry for either of them won't work in my favor. Like, \"Woe is me. All I want is the approval of the Dark Lord.\"It's also the reason why I'm not rushing to reread the following book given the frustrations whenever an author dismisses the actions of an evil character, like Snape, for \"Oh, Love...\" You've painted your picture for the whole series, making us not only hate but despise Severus Snape, so you can't just drop this pent-up anger with one scene in the seventh book. Snape \"loving\" (more like, marking his territory) a certain someone who chooses not to settle for him doesn't justify his following actions, no matter what storyline tries to redeem him.\u2022 The one thing that really settled with me was when Harry and Dumbledore were discussing\u00a0destiny and \"the\u00a0prophecy\" and how it's neither here nor there: Voldemort sculpted his own enemy, by choosing to believe that prophecy he molded you into his enemy. I listened to a lecture on the topic that voiced a similar idea that in order for there to be good in the world there needs to be evil to defeat.\u201cImagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\u2019Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.\u2018I\u2019d want him finished,\u2019 said Harry quietly. \u2018And I\u2019d want to do it.\u2019\u2018Of course you would!\u2019 cried Dumbledore. \u2018You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal \u2026 in other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you \u2026 which makes it certain, really, that -\u2018\u2018That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\u2022 The main plot-propelling point is circling around the Pensieve, which at the time of reading I found so fascinating and wondered what memories I would store away. However brilliant the first memory from Bob Ogden, sooner than later these flashbacks start feeling like a contrived set up for a grander plot-device, especially when Dumbledore speaks like he's looking through a crystal ball; Professor Trelawney seems tame in comparison.\u201cWhy?\u2019 said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore\u2019s face. \u2018Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?\u2019\u2018I have ideas,\u2019 said Dumbledore, \u2018but no more than that.\u2019\u2018What ideas, sir?\u2019\u2018I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear \u2026 to both of us.\u201dThis was so defeating to read the first time, being held on a leash with the information that could be released, but on this reread, knowing what's ahead, I could relax and take in all the suspense and foreshadowing.\u2022 It's unfortunate, though, that the author deems all these important adult figures in Harry's life valuable only long enough to serve him in the grand scheme of things. Children need adults to look up to for longer than a semester period. I noticed that even when I was having a good time reading, half-way through a thought would creep in to remind me that half of the characters wouldn\u2019t survive this series\u2026 and then it felt somehow wrong to laugh at something they said.\u2022Which leads me to discuss the one thing that I dreaded and put-off... I'd forgotten that rereading Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince meant reliving this emotional trauma of a chapter all-over again. I honestly can't believe I got fooled twice into believing that Snape would come to heal Dumbledore. I was utterly and positively assured that when Severus Snape came running down towards Dumbledore it was to cure him of his wounds. My brain somehow managed to repress the memory of that scene and fooled me into believing the same damn thing I thought the very first time... Evidently, the events of this series have all mixed into one for me so that certain scenes from the last book I expect to show up in here. Though nothing prepared me for this line that broke everything:\n\u2018I am not worried, Harry,\u2019 said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \u2018I am with you.\u2019\nIf nothing else, I'll certainly miss his sage sayings:\n\n\n\n      \u2018Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,\u2019 said Hermione.\n    \n\n\nI commend the cover illustrator, Jonny Duddle, for taking one of the most painful moments in the book and creating such lively artwork out of it:The illustration on the back cover, in particular, had me staring back and forth to take it all in: the tired eye-bags, the sullen face, the grip on his left arm. SO MUCH DETAIL.And on that chipper note, I'll conclude by saying that taking my time with this reread made the journey so worth it.

Rowling. Although I could go on and on about this book, there are so many other reviews and reviewers who are likely to have a better one simply because they wrote it write after reading the book or watching the movie. I read it close to ten years ago, saw the movie at least 5 years ago, and though I would love to re-read them... my TBR pile is way too high. That said... it's a fantastic series full of wild imagination, great beauty and intricate sentiment. In this book, Harry must connect with the past and his dark side, trying to figure out who this half-blood prince is... and when he finds out, everything is different. The book is about relationships... discovering things about yourself and others that you didn't know. And when someone Harry absolutely adores is murdered right in front of him, and it's connected with the half-blood prince, it sends Harry on a downward spiral, out of control, but necessary for him to find the inner strength to fight Lord Voldemort. I can't even begin to write a review for this book... let's just go get some coffee or a drink and talk about it.

It's probably #3 out of the seven books. I enjoyed it so much because it was so info-dumpy. Now, info-dumpy books can be enjoyable if they're written well (this one was). I think the reason I, and many others, wasn't bored with this book is because, in spite of the fact that most of it was backstory, there was still a main plot and a main mystery that each Harry Potter book always features. I also love that Dumbledore is so up close and personal in this book because as a I reader I look up to Dumbledore and Harry looks up to him to and there is just so much heartwarming looking upping. There is one thing I want to note. If you've read the book (or if you know anything about Harry Potter) you know what I'm talking about. I am so sad. It hurts to read that scene and it hurts to think about it. much sad.Overall, this book was very informative and, although some may not enjoy it as much as the others, it is definitely worth a read. \u27b5 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u27b5 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u27b5 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u27b5 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u27b5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoneix - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u27b5 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u27b5 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram", "num_likes": 73, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "4-stars", "young-adult"]}, {"book_id_title": "1.Harry_Potter_and_the_Half_Blood_Prince", "book_id": "1", "book_title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3431674293", "review_id": "3431674293", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "J.L.

Rowling uses the word \u201cclambered\u201d a lot. Like, a ridiculous amount.I've never heard an American use this word one time in my life, so I can only assume it's a British habit, to use \u201cclambered\u201d excessively to describe going over an object, or else Ms. Rowling never learned the words \u201ccrawled\u201d or \u201cclimbed\u201d as a child.She also has the most horrible habit, as a writer, of mentioning minutiae that no one gives a shit about anymore, but then leaves out some very important details. I have the perfect example to use from this book: when Draco Malfoy tries to use one of the Unforgivable Curses on Harry, at Hogwarts no less, Harry's not the least bit interested to tell anyone, but when he turns a corner, we get to read a entire page about Peeves the Poltergeist throwing chalk at him. . . again. Yes, Harry, make sure and go tell staff that Peeves is throwing chalk at you, but leave off that boring business of the student trying to kill you in the bathroom. Such inconsistencies annoy me.Also, after rereading some 3,350 pages of Harry Potter so far this year, I can't help but wonder. . . how are we to keep suspending our disbelief that the adult wizarding world times their actions to coincide perfectly with the school year at Hogwarts? I mean, how can every evildoer in the wizarding world be inspired to perform their misdeeds right as the school year comes to a close in June? Couldn't she just one time have made some bad shit happen in February? This is a writing habit that has just been way too tidy for me.And yet. . . here I was. . . rereading book 6 aloud to my middle child in our living room as my son was in the background, moving his belongings back into the house for summer when I got to this part:\u201cSir, you haven't told us what's in this one,\u201d said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.My son stop moving, set down the box that had been in his hands, then came and sat down on the couch and said, \u201cFelix Felicis.\u201d My daughter and I nodded our heads in approval and Hermione Granger contributed, \u201cIt's liquid luck.\u201dNext thing you know, my littlest child poked her head around the corner and revealed that she'd been listening as well. My middle child blew up in anger at her, throwing a pair of dirty socks at her head, but her little sister prevailed and came into the center of the living room and declared as she sat down on the carpet, \u201cI just want to listen to the story.\u201dImagine me now, feeling the bliss, reading my favorite Harry Potter book to all three of my kids at once, in the center of my living room, on a beautiful spring day. And that right there is the magic, folks. It's not that I'm the world's most engaging narrator. It's not that J.K. Rowling writes novels like Graham Greene. J.K. Rowling's magic is in her storytelling.Storytelling is not writing, and not all writers are storytellers, but good writing that contains excellent storytelling takes the reading experience to the sublime.We clambered to the climax of this story together and now we are poised to take on the last novel together, next week.

One of the things I adore about Harry Potter that it's set in the real world ,\"Our World\" ..the beginning of that book implant that concept.. that the events we're reading since book one is happening here in our real world,The Prime Minister scene/chapter is real amazing addition to the series,and it include most of the major events we witnessed happened at the Wizardry world through the previous books and how it affect our world.The characters get more complicated here at that book..as for Snape secrets reveal...shocking for some and relieve those who always mistrust him being in the good side.. Well plotted twist from J K -which won't stop twisting the plot cleverly specially in Snape's character- Also there's a depth in Draco's character that really serve the plot of this and next book.Then the guardian role of Dumbledore at Harry's life start to manifest at that book. Then the atmosphere of the life in the wizardry world -like the Diagon ally scene was darker than ever. And there's also the romance which is increase at that part due to the coming of age.

A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much more fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way.", "num_likes": 69, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1.Harry_Potter_and_the_Half_Blood_Prince", "book_id": "1", "book_title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/686889823", "review_id": "686889823", "date": "Aug 05, 2013", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Brian Yahn", "user_url": "/user/show/22849115-brian-yahn", "text": "I'm pretty sure the universe only exists so the Harry Potter series could be written.", "num_likes": 70, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1.Harry_Potter_and_the_Half_Blood_Prince", "book_id": "1", "book_title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1706680822", "review_id": "1706680822", "date": "Jul 23, 2016", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Markus", "user_url": "/user/show/26681101-markus", "text": "\u201dAnd now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\u201dIn the wake of epic confrontation in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter and his friends start their sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

And while this series lacks a lot in many aspects, it does have a bunch of wildly interesting characters. Dumbledore and Snape are definitely among them.

It kept me company while I sorted through piles of books, moved furniture around, wiped down walls and shelves and vacuumed behind the heavy items that I only move twice a year. It took most of the day and by evening I was putting things back in their places, arms and back sore, crying quietly to myself as Dumbledore drank that potion. I'm sure it would have looked rather ridiculous if anyone had seen me! Once again I was blown away by Stephen Fry's reading. I've reached a point now where I feel like his voice is more familiar to me than those of people I actually know. I'm quite sad that there is only one left, but I also can't wait to start it. There was a particular sense of sadness to this one, knowing that it is the last year where they are students at Hogwarts, though the trio themselves don't know it yet. I drank in every detail of day-to-day student life --- lessons, Quidditch, Peeves, the Fat Lady.  The first time I read the book I was completely floored by Harry's decision to not come back. There is something so heartbreaking about him having to leave behind the place he considers home a year early. The thought of Harry Potter without Hogwarts was incomprehensible. I had so been looking forward to their final year, and suddenly things had veered off completely. I still think it was brilliant of J.K. Rowling to do that. The Felix Felicis chapter remains one of my favourites. I thought they did a great job with this in the film too, with Daniel Radcliffe demonstrating a talent for comedy that I hadn't anticipated, but as ever, in the book there is just so much more time to expand on things. Although I have always remembered that so much was cut away for the films, it's sometimes surprising to be reminded of just how much was left out. Ginny in the movies is... fine, and I think the actress did a good job with a small amount of screen time. But book Ginny is dynamic, smart, funny, talented -- a much better match for Harry, and I think their relationship works better in the books, makes more sense.  Also, while Ron still treats Hermione pretty poorly here, there is more nuance to it. In the films it's like a lot of his redeeming qualities have been stripped away, and he is dumbed down a lot too. He's smarter and more complex in the books and I do wish more of that had been kept on screen. It's really Dumbledore though who feels so much more real in the books. I don't really know how to explain it, but there is just something about book Dumbledore that eclipses movie Dumbledore. I do think however, that his death scene in the film was beautifully shot and I pictured it similarly in my head as it happened in the book.  Sirius's death in the last book and Dumbledore's in this one really hit hard. I find myself genuinely missing them, as if they are actual people I have lost. Dumbledore's death is almost unbearable, and that realisation that I actually had faith in Snape, only for him let me down, is still jarring, even though I now know what is revealed in the final book. Actually, knowing the truth about Snape makes everything he has to do in this book even harder to read. It's all so brutal. Also every sliver of information about Tom/Voldemort that we are given is almost uncomfortably fascinating. Why are villains so interesting?! I'm counting down the days until my next Audible credit so I can start Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It's going to be strange to not have another one to look forward to and go on with. I felt like that the first time I read the last book.
