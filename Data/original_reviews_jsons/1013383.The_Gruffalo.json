First published in 1999, the scary gruffalo has become one of the world\u2019s best-loved monsters, starring in films and shows galore, and inspiring a huge amount of merchandise. This is the original picture book which started it all, and which has itself won many awards, been translated into over fifty languages, and has been voted the UK\u2019s favourite bedtime story.It begins with a simple idea, of a little brown mouse taking a walk in a \u201cdeep dark wood\u201d. We see a lovely illustration of the deep dark wood before the story begins \u2026 and the small child I read it to thought he might just be able to spy something sinister behind the trees, although he didn\u2019t know the story at all \u2026 So we begin:\u201cA mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.A fox saw the mouse and the mouse looked good.\u2018Where are you going to, little brown mouse?Come and have lunch in my underground house.\u2019\u201d Oh my, what a crafty expression there is on the face of the fox! But our perky, brave little mouse is very quick-thinking:\u201cIt\u2019s terribly kind of you, Fox, but no \u2013I\u2019m going to have lunch with a gruffalo!\u201dAnd as he describes the tusks, teeth and jaws of the terrible monster to the fox, he finishes with:\u201cand his favourite food is roasted fox\u201dwhereupon the fox\u2019s eyes get very wide indeed, and he scoots off in a panic. The mouse however, calmly carries on on his way. In time he meets several other dangerous animals; a fox, an owl, and a snake. Each one whom he meets, clearly intends to eat the mouse, and invites him back to their home, ostensibly for a meal. But every time, the mouse claims he is expected by the fierce gruffalo to his house for a meal instead. We might also have felt as apprehensive and scared as the animals who want to eat the mouse. We learn for instance, that the gruffalo\u2019s favourite foods are \u201cowl ice cream\u201d, and \u201cscrambled snake\u201d. But in fact we don\u2019t feel frightened, and we don\u2019t even believe him! My little friend was giggling as much as I was, because:\u201cSilly old fox, doesn\u2019t he know?There\u2019s no such thing as a gruffalo!\u201d\u201cSilly old owl, doesn\u2019t he know?There\u2019s no such thing as a gruffalo!\u201dAnd:\u201cSilly old snake, doesn\u2019t he know?There\u2019s no such thing as a gruffalo!\u201dWe both had huge grins on our faces, until I turned the next page. Oh! There he was! As large as life and twice as ugly:\u201cOh help! Oh no! It\u2019s a gruffalo!\u201dAnd we clearly see a real, live, gruffalo! He seems to be half a grizzly bear and half a buffalo. And when he spots the mouse:\u201c\u2018My favourite food\u2019 the gruffalo said,\u2018You\u2019ll taste good on a slice of bread!\u2019\u201dBut once again the mouse uses his quick wits and cunning. He boasts to the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest, and what\u2019s more, he can prove it! The gruffalo is very doubtful of this, but humours the mouse, and accompanies him through the forest. Then the two of them once again encounter all the animals the mouse had met before. Not surprisingly, each creature is terrified by the sight of the mouse\u2019s great \u201cfriend\u201d, the gruffalo, whom he had described so perfectly earlier. Each one runs off in a panic, and gradually the gruffalo becomes more and more impressed with the mouse\u2019s apparent toughness. When the mouse then claims that his favourite food is \u201cgruffalo crumble\u201d, it is the gruffalo who turns tail (quite literally, in his case) and flees, with a very very scared expression on his face. Then, in the final double spread:\u201cAll was quiet in the deep dark wood. The mouse found a nut and the nut was good.\u201dThe Gruffalo is a perfectly structured story, inviting the reader equally to laugh and have mock terror. Even the tiniest of tots love to be \u201cfrightened\u201d in this way. Julia Donaldson seems to understand children completely, from the inside. She says that this story was inspired by a Chinese tale about a clever girl who tricks a hungry tiger into believing she is the Queen of the Jungle and scares him away. Julia Donaldson knew that this would make a great picture book for children between about three and seven years of age, but she wanted to do it in rhyme. She couldn\u2019t think of anything to rhyme with \u201ctiger\u201d, so she created her own monster ending in \u201cO\u201d, to rhyme with \u201cdoesn\u2019t he know?\u201d She uses rhyming couplets, and includes much repetitive verse with just minor amusing tweaks, which delight the listener. We know what is coming, but each time there is a little thrill of surprise to make us laugh. The book is about 700 words long, and much of its charm also lies in the illustrations by Axel Scheffler. Once you\u2019ve read it, it is impossible to imagine the gruffalo as anything else, but in fact he might have looked very different. \u201cOur\u201d monster is scary in a cute, dim-witted sort of way, but apparently Axel Scheffler\u2019s first designs were of a monster who was far more frightening than the one we know. He also wondered about making the animals wear clothes, but in the end decided against it.My little Turkish neighbour, aged just four, and I both giggled (and one of us squealed a bit) at this delightful picture book. We haven\u2019t yet ventured through our local \u201cdeep dark woods\u201d though. Perhaps we should do that before we read the follow-up story, written five years later and called, The Gruffalo\u2019s Child. After all, how terrifying might that one be?", "num_likes": 75, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["childrens-1990s", "humour", "animals", "picture-books-kids", "lauren", "children-s-and-ya", "read-authors-c-d"]}, {"book_id_title": "1013383.The_Gruffalo", "book_id": "1013383", "book_title": "The Gruffalo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1887038195", "review_id": "1887038195", "date": "Jan 21, 2017", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Sean Barrs ", "user_url": "/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs", "text": "Brains beat brawns every time.

He defends himself through words rather than violence. He does this by outsmarting the na\u00efve predators by claiming that he is about to meet a \u2018Gruffalo\u2019, a mythical beast. The mouse frightens the predators by giving them vivid descriptions of the beast - ironically, the mouse does meet the 'Gruffalo', and outwits him too.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable children\u2019s tale with an exciting setting and great introductions to various characters. The various animal characters help children identify with different types of animals that could be in a forest. The use of \u2018deep dark wood\u2019 to describe the forest works very well, as it sets the scene and makes the reader excited about what there is to come. The dialogue between characters is very clever and the rhyming is well done. It creates a rhythm for the story and makes you want to read on. The descriptions of the 'Gruffalo' stimulates one\u2019s imagination and the concept of meeting the 'Gruffalo' becomes very exciting. The illustrations are fantastic and capture the essence of the story. The consistent story works very well, especially with an anti-climatic ending where the mouse remains superior. Every part of the story is great, but the witty and clever character of the mouse is definitely the main highlight. I would say that this book is aimed at 3 to 6 year olds and can also be enjoyed by older children. The story could be used in the classroom by interacting with the visuals of the book. The teacher can ask questions about what the animals are called or if the children can spot the \u2018Gruffalo\u2019 anywhere in the detailed illustrations of the \u2018deep dark wood\u2019. The repetition and rhyming theme of the book would make it very enjoyable for children and would help them understand what could happen next in the story. This story could support a lesson in literacy and a topic of rhyming poems and using rhyme in creative writing and story telling.

This meant that my niece could not only listen to me read, but join in by associating the correct sound with the right animal. The book is very bright with lovely illustrations thus making it even more appealing (even without having read the words yet). The story revolves predominately around a mouse and his trek through the woods. He bumps into some intimidating animals and realises that his imagination (of a made up \u2018monster\u2019) will serve him well. Unbeknown to the little mouse, this fictional monster does exist!

So the mouse says\u201d I\u2019m the scariest creature in the wood.\u201d \u201cEveryone is afraid of me.\u201d When the Gruffalo hears this, he bursts with laughter. Then the mouse takes the Gruffalo to the snake, the owl and the fox. They all see the Gruffalo and disappear as quickly as they can. In the end, the mouse scares and fools the Gruffalo and says \u201cEveryone is afraid of me\u201d. Gruffalo sees this and as quick as the wind the Gruffalo turns and flees away.The book is fun to read as it has short rhymes and great illustrations by Alex Scheffler.I recommend this book for EYFS and Key Stage 1 children.You can do many things such as:\u2022 The story can be used effectively as part circle time and then discussed amongst children in EYFS and KS1. \u2022 You can have a lesson on the characters, settings and endings.\u2022 To check understanding of the story, you can ask children questions such as: What is the name of this book?Name the characters of the story.Describe the mouse\u2019s character.Which animal does the mouse meet at the beginning of the story?Why does the fox run away?Which animal does the mouse meet after the fox?Why does the owl fly away?Which animal does the mouse meet after the owl?Why does the snake slither away?Why do all the animals want to eat the mouse?After the snake, who does the mouse see in the woods?Describe the Gruffalo.Does the Gruffalo want to eat the mouse?Which animal sees the Gruffalo first?Which animal sees the Gruffalo second?Which animal sees the Gruffalo third?What does mouse do at the end of the story?\u2022 During Art the children can make Gruffalo, fox, snake and owl masks.\u2022 Hot seating \u2013 Asking the children how the mouse felt when he saw all the animals or how the animals felt when the mouse tried to scare them. During this session, children can wear character masks and make sounds of animals.\u2022 Another activity can be to match the rhyming words together.\u2022 Role playing can use the masks to retell the story. \u2022 You can also go onto a brilliant website that has lots of games and activities. www.gruffalo.com/section.php?s=html/g...", "num_likes": 4, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1013383.The_Gruffalo", "book_id": "1013383", "book_title": "The Gruffalo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1144785434", "review_id": "1144785434", "date": "Dec 28, 2014", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Zoey Emma", "user_url": "/user/show/22707259-zoey-emma", "text": "Such a simple but brilliantly executed story about a mouse and a monster.

However on his way he encounters other animals who want to have him for their dinner, so the mouse decides to tell them that he has a friend who is a Gruffalo so that the other animals will leave him alone.First of all the mouse meets a fox who tries to get the mouse to follow him to his \"underground house\" to have lunch. When the mouse explains to the fox that he cannot have lunch with him because he is going to have tea with a Gruffalo, he describes the terrible creature and to scare the fox away he tells him that the Gruffalo's favourite food is \"roasted fox\", however when the fox is out of view the mouse says to himself that there is no such thing as a Gruffalo. The mouse continues to walk through the woods when he comes across an owl. The owl also attempts to lure the mouse into his house to have him for his tea until the mouse describes other parts of the Gruffalo which is equally terrifying. The mouse manages to get rid of the owl by telling him that the Gruffalo's favourite food is \"owl ice cream\". The mouse finally meets a snake who has the same plans as the fox and the owl. The mouse describes the Gruffalo to the snake and as the snake slides away the mouse is about to say to himself again that there is no such thing as a Gruffalo when he suddenly notices that there is a Gruffalo standing right in front of him. The mouse panics because now the Gruffalo has plans to eat him so he tells the Gruffalo that all of the other animals are afraid of him. So they walk back through the wood and encounter the same animals again the fox, the owl and the snake. Because the mouse had terrified them with the descriptions of the Gruffalo they immediately run away, this way the Gruffalo thinks that everyone is afraid of the mouse. In the end the mouse turns around and tells the Gruffalo that he is going to eat him so the Gruffalo ran away as fast as he could. This book is an enjoyable book to read and I feel that it would be ideal for young children from nursery upwards. It has some repetitive features in the story which will be good for children to join in either in whole class reading at story time or guided reading. The story is also very descriptive which can add to the imagination.

He is just there, does some stuff, and then disappears. Wow. :| You can better call it something different then. Something like Stupid Mouse Makes Stupid Decisions. I am quite sad, I heard a lot about the Gruffalo book, lots of people seem to love it, but I just couldn't like this one. Maybe there can be another book, this time about the Gruffalo and it will tells about a day in the Gruffalo life. I would definitely love that more than a book about a mouse trying to smart his way out of things and then just casually go on with life.The art was pretty good though, that really saved the book from the 1 star.

The illustrations as well are brilliant and it really captures the narrative of the story. This story would be brilliant to read to early years and Key Stage 1.

A child\u2019s imagination and enthusiasm are heightened throughout this book as they are gripped by rhyme, repetition and vivid imagery. There is also an aspect of suspense throughout the story. The children learn the names of different animals which may be found in a forest and also the names of their different habitats.We follow a very clever and witty mouse walk through a forest. The mouse is greeted by different predators, including a fox, an owl and a snake, which are all eager to invite the mouse to their habitat. The mouse, however, knows that each of these animals are only interested in having him for dinner. The mouse, consequently, invents a creature called a Gruffalo. The Gruffalo is described vividly and resembles a monster-like animal. Each of the Mouse\u2019s predators are scared off by his interpretation of the Gruffalo. To the surprise of the mouse he bumps into a real Gruffalo. The Gruffalo explains how he would also like to have the mouse for dinner. \u201c\u2018My favourite food\u2019 the Gruffalo said. \u2018You\u2019ll taste good on a slice of bread!\u2019\u201d The witty mouse however reacts quickly and thus, tricks the Gruffalo. He tells the Gruffalo that he is the most feared creature in the forest, even though he may be small. He walks back through the forest with the Gruffalo to prove his point. Each of the mouse\u2019s previous predators, however, sees the Gruffalo walk alongside him and immediately flee away. The Gruffalo believes they are afraid of the mouse when in reality they are afraid of the Gruffalo. The mouse exclaims that his favourite food is \u2018gruffalo crumble\u2019, this scares the Gruffalo and he too, flees from the mouse. The mouse is left alone in the forest to enjoy his dinner, \u2018The mouse found a nut, and the nut was good\u2019. There is a very important lesson in this story, it doesn\u2019t matter how big or small you are once you are clever you can fool anyone. The mouse was the smallest creature in the forest that day and he fooled all his predators. The rhyming throughout the story keeps the child enthralled and engaged until the very last page. The can read along with the teacher in a classroom setting as the rhyming and repetition throughout the story is very easy to remember and very catchy. They also learn to use their imagination and develop an image of the scary Gruffalo in their heads. A lesson plan could encourage children to use their imagination by drawing and describing their own scary monster, like the Gruffalo.

In order to avoid being eaten as the mouse makes his way through the dark wood, the mouse must utilize clever tactics to trick and distract his predators. His predators include firstly a fox, followed by an owl and then a snake. The mouse creates an 'imaginary' figure in his head to frighten the predators. He proclaims to them that he is on his way to a feast with a Gruffalo, whom he depicts as being a fierce and frightening beast. This description alone forces the fox, the owl and the snake to flee in fear of the beast. In conjunction with this, each time the mouse frightens one of the animals away he proclaims in rhyme \"Doesn't he know? There's no such thing as a Gruffalo!\".However, with a twist in events the monster of his imagination appears in real life in front of his very own eyes. Unlike his successful strategy before, the mouse can no longer create an imaginary figure to scare the Gruffalo as he in fact was the original figure to begin with. The mouse must be coy and think of a plan quickly before he is gobbled up \"on a slice of bread\" by the Gruffalo. The mouse soon comes up with a plan, he has decided that he will convince the Gruffalo that he (the mouse) is the most terrifying creature in the deep dark woods. As the mouse revisits creatures of the wood with the Gruffalo, the mouse manages to successfully convince the beast that he, the mouse, is in fact the scariest creature in the wood.I really enjoyed reading this book. I found the story line enthralling and felt like I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. I felt that it was a highly original tale and displayed an excellent use of credible fantasy in that although everything in the story was made up, it felt as though it was all happening for real. I would recommend this book for reception and key stage 1 years 1 and 2. I think this book would be an excellent resource to utilize in the classroom. The use of rhyme and repetition would help to encourage the children to engage with the story and interact by repeating some of the phrases like \"Doesn't he know? There's no such thing as a Gruffalo!\". I think it would be a good tool to teach the children how rhyme works, I would ask the children what rhymes with various words in the story in order to consolidate their knowledge and understanding of rhyme further.

During he's walk he encounters different animals who invite him back to their home only so they can eat mouse. The cunning mouse tells the animals he plans to dine with he's friend the Gruffalo, he describes the features of Graffalo and claims that hes favourite animal happens to be them. This scares the animals and they flee. When mouse carry's on with he's walk he is surprised to see a real Gruffalo with all the features he thought he was inventing. The Gruffalo wanted to eat the mouse but again the mouse was cunning and said that he is the scariest in the forest. The Gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse back into the forest to demonstrate how feared he is and encounters all the animals in the order he met them. Each animal was terrified at the sight of the Gruffalo and each time the Graffalo was more impressed by the mouse's toughness. The cunning mouse took this to advantage and threatens to eat the Gruffalo which than flees. Julia Donaldson has written a very creative story which instantly captures the young wild imaginations that children have. This book can be a great starter for creative descriptive writing, I have read this book to a year two class and done some follow up work on creating our own monsters and describing their features as well as acting out these monsters (developing the use of adjectives and similes). The lessons were a great success because of the natural wild imagination that children already have! The book also makes use of rhyming couplets, synonyms and repetitive verses making it easy for children to remember and retell the story as well as join in at times. What I love about this book is that it is split into two parts, the second part requires children to use their memory and understanding skills to reiterate the order of which the mouse met the animals on his way into the forest.The story is without a doubt amusing for readers and listeners and conveys a smart message that that even the most threatening of monsters are not always as scary as they seem at first.

Along the way, the mouse encounters many predators; the fox, owl and the snake, knowing very well that they are eager to make him their prey, the mouse invents tales of a creature called the Gruffalo. The smart thinking mouse one by one leers off his predators by giving vivid description of the creature; 'terrible tusks and terrible claws, with terrible teeth in his terrible jaws. He has knobbly knees and turned out toes and a poisonous wart at the end of his nose. His eyes are orange, his tongue is black, he has purple prickles all over his back'. The mouse successfully wards off any potential harm and proudly sets off for the rest of his journey. Much to his astonishment, his figment of imagination turns into reality when he's confronted by the real Gruffalo. However, being the smart thinking mouse that he is, the mouse ends up convincing the Gruffalo that all the animals are scared of him and his favourite meal is 'Gruffalo crumble'. Ultimately his fight for survival leads him scaring off the Gruffalo and becoming the King of the Jungle!Donaldson instantly draws us into the 'deep dark woods' and our minds are captivated throughout the whole journey. This is a brilliant book that can be read to reception and KS1 children and thoroughly enjoyed by all. The illustrations used are great and go well with the text, as they allow the children to use their imagination and create their own image of this mystical creature throughout, setting the story alive. The use of repetition and rhyme engages the children, getting them involved and creating a sense of excitement within the classroom. It's an excellent opportunity to be used in literacy for KS2 children to develop their creative writing and for KS1 children where they can explore their imaginations and describe what they think the Gruffalo looks like. It could also be used during art lessons, giving the children a chance to draw their interpretation of the Gruffalo. At first glance, one would assume that it would be a scary read for younger kids but the dominant use of humour in the story eliminates the scary elements.

This book would be suitable for Early Years children aged about four years old, however it can even be enjoyed by adults. The short rhymes and their repetitive structure makes the Gruffalo a fun book to read aloud reinforcing words and giving children the opportunity to become familiar with the style of writing. It is a humorous story where the mouse is in constant peril but uses his brain to outsmart the other animals. Due to the encounters with all the different animals and also due to the situations the mouse finds himself in, the book could be read using different tones and levels of volume making it even more exciting. The book can even inspire activities such as role-play to be carried out, as children find it exciting and amusing to copy animals, make silly sounds and act out different emotions. Moreover, the vibrant colours and fantastic illustrations used in the book can help develop a child's imagination. The images captivate a child's attention and can be used as a method to strike up a conversation about what they think might happen next.

By informing the reader of the intent of the mouse and the trick he plays on the animals, the audience is immediately hooked and included in the story. This story allows the audience to relate to the cheeky mouse and enjoy the trick he plays on the animals and even his surprise when he finds that the Gruffalo exists.\tThis story is an excellent choice for key stage one children and has many applications in the classroom. The Gruffalo as a character can be drawn on in art class for children to develop retrieval skills. The story has given a brilliant and detailed description of the Gruffalo and this creates a great opportunity for children to bring these ideas together to create their own version of this fearsome creature. \tAs a class dialogue there are many topics to focus on. As a group a class can discuss; Why the mouse had to trick the animals? How the animals felt when they heard of the hungry Gruffalo and its favorite food? Why the Mouse was shocked to find the Gruffalo? This could lead into smaller group discussions and even creative writing with their own retelling of the story to enhance retrieval skills. They could also create their own versions of the gruffalo constructing a creature that could help on a person journey such as shopping, going on a trip to the park or even to school. \tOverall this is a great short story that can be used to inspire a classroom on many different levels. Through its success the Gruffalo has now become a brand and has developed many different types of merchandise and media, all which can be useful in the classroom to further children\u2019s understanding of the story.

As the mouse encounters each predator he scares them away with the promise that he is meeting a Gruffalo for lunch. The mouse describes the imaginary Gruffalo to each predator, informing each predator that the Gruffalo's favourite snack is the predator themself. At the end of the mouse's travels he meets a Gruffalo who wants to eat him. The mouse convinces the Gruffalo to take a walk with him to realise how feared the mouse is and to scare the Gruffalo away. As the Gruffalo traces the mouse's steps he meets all of the mouse's predators, each in turn flees at the sight of the Gruffalo. The Gruffalo becomes fearful of the mouse, believing he is a threat. The Gruffalo then leaves the clever mouse, allowing him to escape all the dangers of the deep dark wood. I first read this book to a pre-school class at nursery and they thrived with excitement. This book comes to life when read aloud and young children feel the tension of the creatures in the wood as the mouse describes the Gruffalo. Slowly the reader is able to conjure up a vision of the mythological beast which leaves both adults and children on tender hooks, nervous and fascinated about what will happen next. I really loved this book; it made me feel like a big child lost in a world of fantasy and imagination. This book can be enjoyed by children from pre-toddler to adult. Younger children will love the beautiful illustrations whereas the older children can appreciate the storyline and the suspense that builds with every page. This book is a great story time read for the classroom, Julia Donaldson employs rhyme throughout making this picture book a fun read. Not only does this book entertain but it can also be used to help children develop the basic concept of rhyme and poetry.

He invented the Gruffalo because on his journey, through the forest, he comes across many predators who want to eat him. By creating this creature and telling his predators he is meeting the Gruffalo for lunch, he frightens them away.But then the mouse himself sees a real Gruffalo. Using all of his quick thinking, has to try to trick the Gruffalo, as the Gruffalo too wants to eat the little mouse.The cunning mouse encourages the Gruffalo to walk through the forest with him, to have him believe that he himself, although small, is the scariest creature in the forest.As they set off back through the forest, they pass each of the predators. One by one, they take one look at the Gruffalo and run away. However the Gruffalo, to his amazement, believes it is because of the mouse that they scarper.The mouse indicates at the end of the story that his favourite meal is \"Gruffalo crumble\" which causes the Gruffalo to run away from him. So like the other predators he too was tricked by the clever little mouse.This is a great book for both children and adults. Through the mouse's description of the creature, it enables both children and adults to create an image of the Gruffalo in their minds, and anticipating what will happen next.This book can definitely be appreciated by all ages. Children can enjoy the beautiful illustrations, whereas older children and adults can be left in suspense by the clever descriptions given to them by the mouse.Using rhyme helps to make the story fun to read.

The little mouse does this by inventing a make believe scary animal called 'The Gruffalo'. However it turns out that this animal is not make believe when the mouse bumps into him in the woods. However the little mouse also tricks ;The Gruffalo'. This story is great as the children enjoy the rhythmic sounds throughout. The different use of animal characters gives the teacher/reader a chance to make the book come alive changing their tone of voice for each animal. Children thrive on this type of reading. For example for the charater of the snake, all the 's' letters can b dragged out to sound like a hissing snake. This adds flavour to the story telling session and encourages the children to pay attention. This book proved to be a great success from my experience with five year old children. They were intrigued and listened attentively to the quirky little rhymes 'terrible tusks, terrible claws, terrible teeth and terrible jaws'. It is a great book to base lessons on and even to get the children to draw their own 'Gruffalo' from all the descriptions listed throughout the book. The Gruffalo is beautifully illustrated which makes it even more appealing to the little readers. I rate this book as one of the most enjoyable, appealing and useful picture books for this age group.

This story is about a very clever little mouse who outsmarts all the different animals in the forest to avoid being eaten. This story really highlights that, looks can be deceiving as this tiny little mouse manages to evade danger of being eaten through intelligence alone. This story shows that strength does not always manifest itself as a physical thing; rather one can have a lot of strength which can be demonstrated by their intelligence. I feel to some extent this book can empower children as they can learn that size really does not matter.This story is essentially about a mouse\u2019s journey through the woods whereby the mouse makes up a fictional character \u201cGruffalo\u201d in order to avoid being eaten. All the animals flee feeling scared that the Gruffalo will eat them. Ironically the mouse coincidently meets an actual Gruffalo. Once again the mouse uses his intelligence to outsmart the Gruffalo. I think the underlying message in this story is that intelligence can help in many situations; it\u2019s also an empowering book, which highlights that size does not matter. The book has subtle under tones about being judgemental as it is very easy to judge people based on how they look, I suppose it highlights the importance of not being judgemental.

The author has used rhyming couplets as well as repetition, which makes it an excellent read as part of a class reading session. The story can be used as a basis for a literacy lesson as the use of adjectives to describe the Gruffalo can help develop children\u2019s vocabulary and imagination. The teacher can brainstorm different describing words based on what the children can see from the colourful illustrations. In addition, the children can recreate scenes of the story in groups as part of a drama lesson and also come up with ideas as to which animals the mouse can encounter next if the story was to continue.

This can be used as part of home-time reading activity to entertain or as part of a drama played by the class to encourage confidence and character. whilst reading out loud to engage the children the teacher can adopt different voices for each character as well as using hand gestures such as rubbing the belly saying 'gruffalo-crumble' and 'owl-icecream'. Another way this book maybe be used in a classroom is to introduce the story and lay the task for the children to write their own story with a character made up by themselves.

However after these animals scupper, the tiny mouse is in fact greeted by the Gruffalo in a somewhat sinister manner. Nevertheless, the mouse manages to yet again escape the sticky situation and survive.I have chosen this book because at the core it has a classic theme - the tale of the underdog who succeeds against the odds, and shows that strength or success does not always come in a conventional manner.

After reading this book to a year 1 class, I recommend it to all early years teachers and parents. The school library or the bookshelf at home isn\u2019t quite complete without this book. It has recently become one of my personal favorites. The book tells the story of a brave mouse who decides to take a stroll through the deep dark woods. On the course of his walk, he comes across different animals such as a Fox, an Owl and a snake that all desire to eat him. To each animal he comes across, the mouse explains that he is on his way to meet his friend the Gruffalo, and describes his scary appearance. This I turn frightens the animals away and the clever mouse avoids being eaten. Children barely get bored of hearing this story read. The repeated line \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a Gruffalo\u201d really gets children engaged and involved in the story. The humor found in this book is age appropriate and entertaining. The rhyming gives the story a great flow and makes it simple for children to follow. On the other hand, this book may indirectly be teaching children that dishonesty is permissible. Beautiful illustrations by Axel Scheffler fill the pages of the book. This is a good read for EYFS and KS1 children. The book can also be used in English lessons, role-play and possibly circle time activities.

By doing so he passes through all the animals without a scratch, and by meeting the Gruffalo himself, he manages to stay alive and well.I really enjoyed reading this book because the first thing I thought about was the tactic of survival and clearly the mouse knew it all too well. Children will automatically feel that because the mouse is small it won\u2019t survive but in actuality it can and does. I think the best age for this book would be children in year 1 so children aged 5-6 years old. The creativity behind the story and the illustrations to match up each other, help the children feel curious and ponder upon what might happen to the mouse.This book can be read to the children as a whole class, and may set up activities in relation to the story such as being able to write the story from beginning, middle and end by using strips of sentences with the pictures that may come with it.

It is an expressive story about a clever little mouse travelling through the deep dark woods meeting a fox, an owl and a snake along the way. The only problem is they want to, potentially, eat him. However, the quick thinking mouse, tells a tale of a scary fictional beast called the 'Gruffalo' to get out of the tricky situations. A dramatic twist in the story shows how the mouse ends up confronting the fictional beast later, who is actually real and wants to eat the little mouse too. The double twist in the story then arises when the quick witted mouse tactically escapes the \u2018Gruffalo' by devising another tale by which he successfully outsmarts the beast.I can read this to my own children (aged 3 and 7) many times and they are absorbed by its rhyming couplets and repetition which allows story telling to flow brilliantly. The book has vibrant illustrations by Axel Scheffler which are light hearted yet good enough to display and help children visualise the scary \u2018Gruffalo\u2019 before his grand appearance. The pictures can help children of all abilities comprehend and enjoy the story. My three year old can describe the \u2018Gruffalo\u2019 through the pictures, so story telling becomes very interactive.This book can be used in many ways to form creative lessons especially in reception and year 1 classes. The story can be told in segments with activities based around each theme forming discussions to get the children involved. In literacy children can identify rhyming words and create their own rhymes and in creative writing children can brainstorm ideas to form versions of a scary imaginary character using synonyms of the words used to describe the \u2018Gruffalo\u2019 in the book. Also, through improvisation and role-play children can use the different characters to construct a short play and bring the story to life. It can also be incorporated into science, integrated into the learning of food chains, habitats and adaptations of animals. Art lessons benefit greatly using this book as of its excellent descriptions of the animals and brilliant illustrations. Also, on a moral level it also can be used to convey the importance of telling the truth and how a little fib like the mouse told, which although did get the mouse out of trouble from being eaten by predators, did eventually land him to confront the real beast in the end.Overall, story telling truly comes to life with this admirable book and children discover how the mouse becomes the hero of the story, and his innocent betrayal of the others animals puts him in and out of inconvenient situations. The Gruffalo is fun to read, dynamic and catchy and therefore it is a must have in every classroom.

It's not bad, especially because the main character is lying to save their own life. There's a mouse, and a fox sees the mouse and implies that he's going to eat him. The mouse says, 'No, I'm going to wait for my friend The Gruffalo, who's scary and gigantic and likes to eat foxes.' The fox leaves in fear, and the mouse says to himself, \"Silly old Fox! Doesn't he know? There's no such thing as a Gruffalo!\" The mouse then encounters an owl and a snake, using the same story on them, getting more descriptive about the imaginary monster. Suddenly, he encounters a Gruffalo, exactly as he had described. Which is a rather unusual twist for a trickster tale. The Gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but the mouse shows the Gruffalo that the fox, owl, and snake are all afraid of the two of them (obviously to the reader, because they are afraid of the Gruffalo, not the mouse, but the Gruffalo interprets it as them being afraid of the mouse), and then the mouse threatens to eat the Gruffalo, who leaves in fear. The end.Like I said, it's a really unusual twist to have the thing that a character is explicitly, intentionally lying about, turn out to be true. Of course, as in most \"trickster tales\", it relies on the \"tricked\" characters being complete idiots. For me, this doesn't paint the trickster as clever or intelligent, just lucky and dishonest. If the mouse wasn't trying to save his own life, this would have a bad message, but as it is, it's just middle-of-the-road. It's perfectly reasonable to lie to somebody to save your own life.The rhymes are actually pretty good. The meter is good, nothing feels forced, and it seems like it would work well being read aloud. And the descriptions of The Gruffalo are interesting. I guess people enjoy seeing others get tricked. Of course, as is the case in similar stories with anthropomorphic animals, you have the moral quandary of intelligent animals eating other intelligent animals. If they were all humans instead of animals, this whole thing would be highly disturbing, but they're not, so it's not. So I guess it's okay for a talking fox to eat a talking mouse. I know it's a convention we're pretty used to by now, but that doesn't mean it isn't weird.Message: People who try to hurt you are stupid, and will fall for obvious tricks.For more children's book reviews, see my website at http://www.drttmk.com.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1013383.The_Gruffalo", "book_id": "1013383", "book_title": "The Gruffalo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2143315215", "review_id": "2143315215", "date": "Oct 04, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lucy Allison", "user_url": "/user/show/70534442-lucy-allison", "text": "This was a very good book for shared reading, because it involves a lot of prediction.

At the end of each meeting with an animal, the mouse says: \"Silly old (animal's name)! Doesn't he know, there's no such thing as a Gruffalo?\" This is beneficial for shared reading, because the children join in with the story, as they can predict what is going to happen next. The language also follows the same sentence structure: an animal meets the mouse; the animal tries to eat him; the mouse explains why he can't be eaten because he is meeting with the Gruffalo; the mouse describes the Gruffalo and says that his favourite food is the animal he's talking to; the animal runs away. This repetitiveness encourages prediction and response, as the children are more able to understand the story.There are also many excellent illustrations in the storybook that support the text. For example, each time the mouse describes the Gruffalo; we just see the features that he is describing, not the whole Gruffalo. This encourages the children to use their imagination to guess what the Gruffalo could look like and each time they receive more clues.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["picturebooks", "ks1", "monsters"]}, {"book_id_title": "1013383.The_Gruffalo", "book_id": "1013383", "book_title": "The Gruffalo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2569438961", "review_id": "2569438961", "date": "Oct 22, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Summer Norton", "user_url": "/user/show/85699177-summer-norton", "text": "Summary:The Gruffalo is about a mouse who encounters multiple predators and every time he meets one he describes new details about his friend the Gruffalo. Eventually, the mouse encounters a real Gruffalo that matches his description. To keep from being eaten, he tells the Gruffalo he is the most feared in the forest and proves it to him by reencountering all the predators from earlier. As he encounters each one, they all scatter because the mouse had told them that they were the Gruffalo's favorite meal. After seeing all the predators scatter, the Gruffalo becomes scared of the mouse and runs away.Evaluation:This is a good story about how brains and cunningness can protect even the smallest of creatures. The mouse proves this by describing something that the predators would be afraid so that he would not be eaten. Each time he added another detail and told the predator that they were the creatures favorite meal. Then when the mouse was encountered by his described creature, he used his earlier lie to save him from being eaten by the creature. To come up with lies on the spot takes brains and cunningness.Teacher Tip:As a teacher, I would use this story to talk about visualization and descriptions. The lesson would begin with me reading the story and having the students draw their own Gruffalo based on the description. Then I would show the students what the illustrations show what a Gruffalo looks like. This would lead to a discussion about how they want to add enough detail to their own writing. I would follow this by giving the students a picture of an odd looking creature and have them write a description of the creature.

The mouse tells the fox that the gruffalo eats foxes and the fox ran away. But, there is no such thing as a gruffalo. The mouse then ran into the owl who tried to eat the mouse. The mouse told him he was on his way to see the gruffalo who has knobby knees, turned out toes, and a poisonous wart on his nose. The mouse told the owl that the gruffalo's favorite food is owl and the owl flies away. The mouse then runs into a snake and the mouse tells him the same thing that he is going to meet the gruffalo. The mouse describes the gruffalo with having orange eyes, a black tongue, with purple prickles all over his back. But, little does the snake know the gruffalo isn't real. Once the snake learns that the gruffalo eats snakes, he slithers away. As the mouse continues on in the forest, he runs into the real gruffalo. The gruffalo tries to eat the mouse but he said wait and said that he was the scariest animal in the forest. He told the gruffalo to follow behind him and he would prove his scariness. The mouse and the gruffalo pass the snake, owl, and fox who run in fear from the gruffalo following behind the mouse. The mouse then tells the gruffalo that his favorite food was gruffalo crumble and the gruffalo ran away scared. The mouse sat in peace and ate his nuts.
