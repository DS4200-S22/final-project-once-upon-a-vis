The novel follows the story of Joel Backman, a newly pardoned prisoner who had tried to broker a deal to sell the world's most powerful satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. Joel Backman is \"The Broker,\" a Washington power broker-lobbyist, considered by some to be one of the most powerful men in Washington. However, his life falls apart when a deal collapses involving a hacked spy satellite that nobody knows about, and Backman ends up in jail. Six years later, the political wheels in Washington have turned and other power-hungry men are eager for his blood. Bargains are made, and after an outgoing disgraced president grants him a full pardon at the behest of the CIA, he finds himself spirited out of the prison in the middle of the night, bundled onto a military plane, and flown to Italy to begin a new life. He has a new name and mysterious new \"friends\" who will teach him to speak the language and to blend in with the people in Bologna. However, he soon realizes that something isn't quite kosher in this new setup, in that he is under constant surveillance. In reality, the CIA is setting him up for professional assassins from China, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other countries. They intend to sit back and wait to see who kills him in an effort to solve the biggest mystery to hit the US government in decades: the question of who built this seemingly impenetrable and most advanced satellite ever. It turns out to be China; despite having low satellite technology, they stole the information from the U.S. Backman barely survives several assassination attempts and manages to establish communication with his son, Neal. He escapes surveillance and returns to his home to contract a new deal with the U.S. government. The CIA is told about the satellite, along with the taking of the satellite's program. In return, they agree to do what they can to get the countries targeting him to back off, though they caution him that some of them will not listen. Backman then covers his escape by pretending that he is resuming his old life, then quietly disappears and presumably returns to Italy.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e

While I applaud him for stepping outside of his comfort zone, I am glad he stepped back in.As you may have seen in other reviews, almost 2/3 of this book is learning Italian language and culture filler. It could easily have been summed up \"and then the main character spent some time learning Italian and I'm emersing himself in the culture\" and we would have ended up in the same place. And, what is even crazier is that him learning to be Italian doesn't really play into the ultimate resolution of the book.So, if you want to try Grisham, don't start here.

So sensitive that it would become a game changer for future military conflict.All Joel could see were dollar signs in front of his eyes and so he tried to sell it to the highest bidder. When the CIA became aware of this Joel was arrested and convicted for treason and to spend the next twenty years of his life behind a prison door.There were a lot of countries after Joel\u2019s blood, promises were made and promises were broken. As a result Joel spent much of his life looking over his shoulder, even in prison.When the current Presidents term was just about over he gave, much to Joel\u2019s delight and surprise, a pardon for past wrong doings. The reality was that this was a CIA ruse to see who would kill Joel first.Part of the ruse was to give Joel a new identity and send him somewhere safe, which turned out to be Bologna Italy. So Joel ends up in Bologna with some CIA minders in tow.At this point the book becomes a travelogue for Bologna, a crash course in learning Italian and also a good food guide to the best restaurants in Bologna. This would have been interesting had I been interested in going to Bologna. Enough said.Where credulity leaves us was when Joel, who knows about as much about espionage as I do, decides to takes on the CIA at there own game.Look there were parts that were quite exciting but there were lots of it that were just a drag so as I said at the beginning, at its best this was just so-so.

Since I want him to read Joel Salatin, in a tit-for-tat deal I agreed to read The Broker. The first 13 pages, the political pardon arrangement, were hilarious. I was hooked. But not for long. After the main character, Backman, was whisked away to Europe by the CIA, the spy-vs-spy vs innocent-in-a-strange-land story - or whatever this was supposed to be - went awry. At this point Grisham's editor - he does have one, I presume - should have sent back the manuscript and told his celebrated author to toss all pages from 14 on into the garbage and not only rewrite the book, but rethink the story. What is all this mangiare and vino and birra and espresso doing in a story of a man hunted by assassins? While I belong to the 1% of Grisham's readers who thoroughly enjoyed learning to speak basic Italian right along with Backman, I was expecting a thriller, not a language lesson and tour guide to northern Italy with an emphasis on Bologna. To repeat, where was his knife-wielding editor?Worse, The Broker doesn't make sense. It contains many plot Whys, but I'll note just 5 big ones. First, the CIA places Backman in Italy, gives him an apartment and wardrobe but no money or passport, tutors him in how and when to order a cappucino, and then gives the equivalent CIAs of 4 foreign governments a recent photo of Backman on the streets of Bologna just because the CIA wants to see who will kill him. The CIA says this plan is vital to the national security of the U.S.A., but even I, a non-reader of thrillers, recognize that this plan is pointless, so why do it? Second, how is killing Backman going to help the CIA get what they desperately want, which is JAM? Third, since the CIA believes Backman has JAM, why didn't they stick to Plan A and inject him with sodium pentathol when they had him under their thumb at the military hospital? Fourth, eventually we learn that Backman does have JAM. He's always had it. So why didn't he cut a deal with the CIA before he was sentenced to 20 years in solitary confinement? Of course, had Backman done that, this book would not exist. Fifth, while real life doesn't have neat endings, fiction does. But this story has no conclusion. Is Backman safe now from all his would-be assassins, or not? Is this sloppy mess typical of Grisham or was I just handed a lemon?

The Broker gave us a little preview of how the decisions go into process inside the government legally and (surprisingly\u2026not!) illegally. In this novel, the process goes a little too corrupt. It began with a Washington power broker-lobbyist and a lawyer, Joel Backman. He is, in the story, the famous broker that was sent to jail for six years. Upon the dissolution of his sentence, the political wheels in Washington have turned and numerous powerful people want him dead. So, several bloody bargains were made. Unexpectedly, the outgoing disgraced president granted him a full pardon at the request of the CIA.

Many readers are disappointed and say this is a slow book that Grisham wrote just to have an excuse to spend more leisurly time in Italy, and that he spends far too much time describing details of Italian towns and Italian language that are totally irrelevant to the plot.I adore Grisham, but it's all true: after the first few chapters, that I found gripping and intriguing as ever, Grisham's fast, punchy writing comes to an almost complete halt, when the main charachter arrives in Italy and he starts taking in all things Italian so that he can blend in as much as possible. Pages and pages of details on how wonderful Italy is, the life there and the food and the people. Well, I am Italian, so all this is very flattering. Yes, a little too much of an idealized Italy, especially an idea of Italy that very much exists in the minds of tourists, but nonetheless, flattering. And yes, a pleasure to be reminded of the beauty of my country, as I don't live in Italy anymore. But these pages where Grisham takes us through the main charachter's Italian lessons and his wonderings in Bologna are just so useless and so far removed from the plot, written with a completely different pace and mood, that they seem like those weird candies that you sometimes find in a piece of chocolate: they have nothing to do with it, and they actually end up ruining the experience of eating that piece of chocolate. Maybe he was trying to write something a bit different, something like a mix of espionage thriller and romance, but there is just something that doesn't quite work out with the two parts of this book. For this book to be as strong as most of his other books, he should have stuck to the initial plot, and driven it relentlessly to its end. I loved the idea of the secret satellite system, and oh my God I sincerely loved the idea of having the Chinese burn an entire forest in order to launch these satellites without being seen by other countries. The Russians did it for real, I think, but I'd have to google that and i cant be bothered now. Anyway, overall a nice read, but what Grisham is asking his loyal readers, in this book, is a little too much. He was the one who had the most fun with this book, that is for sure!!!

This book was one of those that I had not picked up yet, so I was reading this for the first time and it definitely did not disappoint. I have to admit that I do struggle with stories based on political themes, especially if those are not in the country I am living in, but with this novel it really didn't matter too much. Everything was told in a way that explained to me what was going on, without being preachy, and made it easier for me to understand what was going on. What I loved about this story was the main character Backman, following his story and watching him as he navigates his way through situations that he was being placed in. You also have the character of Teddy Maynard who while I was reading this I was thinking that I recognised this characters.

What the government does is they incarcerate him for 6 years to make sure that the secret of the satellite doesn't get leaked out then an unexpected presidential pardon release him of his 20 year sentence with the CIA haven different intention they ship him to a oversea country in a military cargo ship, his new home Italy, new identity, no friends besides his CIA friend and mentor Lugi and his Italian instructors. \tI found this book very exciting that man just been released just to be killed what a plot in a book. knowing that this man was able to outwit many people in his new home of Italy and that he was able to withstand whatever the government has thrown at him the ability to adapt to in a new environment was exceptionally impressive in this book new language, customs and tradition learned in merely in a couple of weeks what an outstanding person this Joel Backman is.\tThis book was so descriptive telling every detail that was necessary for you to get an enchanted feeling of the book just like if you was in Italy describing the smell of the food the customs how so different and oddly more polite then American customs.\tThis book reflects many subjects in life how the book talks about the power in government how it\u2019s twisted and how the world is now. that not all what can be done is being done but the people are merely just looking out for themselves cant really compare a matter such big to a simple life style for myself but if I get compare I would say that know days no one can do anything with out someone that is watching them do I'm saying that people are always overview my life how Joel Backman was.\tWho would I recommend this book to that's an excellent question to ask?

During his time as a high ranking attorney in Washington, three young, but brilliant, Pakistanis discover a surveillance satellite that has technology that is decades ahead of everyone else. The Pakistanis find a way to take over the satellite and manipulate it to work for them. Joel Backman decides to help them sell the program but when all three are found dead and no one accepts responsibility for the killings or the satellite, Joel becomes worried for his life. When the CIA arrest him for past crimes, he quickly pleads guilty and serves time.After serving 6 years in prison, the President gives Joel a full pardon in the eleventh hour of his presidency. It looks like Joel will get out early and earn 14 years of his life back. But the catch is he has to move out of the country and take on a whole new identity. Backman agrees with this idea because he is still worried about the people who killed his three young partners. He takes up his new life in the small Italian town of Bologna as Marco Lazerri. He spends the majority of his time learning the culture and, of course, the language. What he doesn't know is that the CIA planned the pardon from the beginning. They pardoned Backman and then leaked the information of his new identity to the possible countries that would've had motive behind the killings six years earlier. They figure that once the broker's location and new identity is \"discovered\", the actual owner will exact their revenge on Backman by assassination. Backman is the cheese in the mousetrap and the CIA does not worry if he gets eaten so long as they can locate the mouse.I enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to follow in the beginning but really picked up after the first 75 pages. It has a lot of suspense and twists.

I kinda just looked at the mystery genre and picked out a book that I thought would interest me. It's funny how books are the one thing that we do judge solely based on the cover sometimes. Anyways, The Broker by John Grisham certainly didn't disappoint.It starts out by with sitting President Morgan, who is on his way out after a historically bad campaign, pardoning the notorious Joel Backman, sentenced to years in prison for stealing of classified documents. This was done due to the advice of the Director of the CIA, Teddy Maynard. While Morgan simply wanted to spite America for his horrid campaign, Teddy had other ideas. He wanted to relocate Backman, leak his location, and try to get another country to kill him. Much of the book is spent covering Joel's transition to Italian (the country to which he is relocated) life, including a name change to Marco Lazzeri. As this goes on, however, many subtle hints are dropped as to what Joel's past holds. When the CIA finally leaks Joel's whereabouts to other countries, the climax happens. I can't give spoilers and I had a whole great explanation of what was going to happen next with the whole why the CIA wants to kill Joel, why they can't do it on their own. But no spoilers, so I'll have to settle for a nice little READ THE BOOK AND ALL WILL BE REVEALED.Grisham's way of hiding much of both Joel's past and the CIA's plans really drew me in. I wanted to know what they were planning for Joel, and why they were even doing this in the first place. It turns out they really wanted to know who owned that satellite. What didn't appeal to me as much was the amount of time spent on Joel's assimilation into Italian culture. While I do think it was necessary for both the overall story and the buildup to the climax, it was kind of boring for me. That was really my only problem, and I didn't think it was worth taking a star off a perfect rating.

This book was published in in the early 2000 and was very suspenseful with a thriller that deals with the law, just like many of his other books. The book is a realistic fiction about a lawyer that was put in prison for having possession of an encryption of secret Chinese satellites. The CIA asked President Morgan to give him an eleventh hour pardon so that maybe a foreign government would find and kill him. Throughout the book, the reader watches how the lawyer protect his life, and how he coverers up his evidence. Grisham developed the characters wonderful for this storyline. He gives each one of them a different kind of personality that the reader can understand and relate to quickly, adding to the suspense of the book, and making it more interesting for the reader. The plot of the book does a good job of keeping the reader on the edge of their seat, and it is hard to put the book down.

Although Grisham stays consistent with his books in that they are all realistic fiction stories about the law, he makes sure each one is unique and different from all the others. He does this by focusing on a different law in each book and creating new characters every time with all new traits. This time, he decided to explore the life of a pardoned convict that was given an all new life by the CIA, but then made the mistake of leaking his location.

The book starts with the President who lost re-election and decided to pardon the broker at the CIA's request so that the foreign governments could kill him abroad. It turns out the reason that the CIA wanted to free the Broker and have him killed was so they know who built the system and it would overall answer unanswerable questions to them. It seems to me the main players in this espionage thriller were the Chinese who built the system, Mossad who was pissed that the Saudi's won the bid to buy the satellite system and wanted it for themselves, and the Saudi's who won the bid for the selling the system. The ending was great too, with Joel giving the satelite technology to the Pentagon and calling a press conference to throw the Chinese Assasin off his tracks so he can lay low again.It is almost a 5 star book but I cannot get over the slowness that occurred in the book when he talked about Marco Lazzari learning Italian. For me, it really slowed down the book.Within the thriller there are few politico-moral dillemas:1) In the book, it is implied that the President excepted money for political pardons especially for rich clients. This kind of reminds me of Clinton's pardon of Mark who was a rich benefactor to his campaign. Sure, his crime was white collar and thus only indirectly hurts the US, but I still think it is wrong.2) All his books, Grisham showcases the competing interest between the FBI and the CIA and the Oval Office. It is no wonder Al-Quaeda was able to infiltrate the US because of the lack of coordination between the three powers that should be able to protect us. I do not think this is an isolated event as Looming Towers suggest there is really an intense competition between the FBI and the CIA for gathering evidence on one hand the gathering of information on the other. In the book, this tension shows itself in that the CIA wants to keep Marco alive to gather information from him and eventually kill him to protect the information that he knows. The FBI on the other hand wants to prosecute Joel for possible bribe in the pay-for-pardon scam. The two do not trust each other enough to let the other side know why they want Marco/Joel, thus creating a standoff. In terms of our national security/and terrorism, this is scary stuff. If two of the most important bodies to our defense do not trust each other than terrorist attacks are likely in the future.3)In the book, a professor of law in Texas was kicked out from his position because he espoused communist leanings. I think Texas has a right to kick him out only as in this case he teaches communism in his class room especially if it is a core class but I do not UT should have kicked him out if he was just an espoused communist but did not teach it in his classroom.4)In the book of course, the CIA wanted Joel released in a foreign country so other governments would be able to kill him.Now is that legal? Sure it is legal but it is definitely unethical and immoral. 5) CIA if the story is true is scary because they seem to be making their own rules outside the purview of the executive branch that they are under. Does this actually happen in real life? I am sure in extenuating circumstances it does but it is still scary because it recalls a certain state police mentality without checks and balances. So this means, the Iran-Contra affair really could have happened without Reagan's direct knowledge.6)Lobbyist, Broker, adequately gets what he deserves because he was ready to sell US intelligence capabilities to the highest bidder. The brings to mind lobbyist precarious position in representing companies or countries who maybe counter to US interests. So they become mercenaries ready to sell their services to the highest bidder.

I remember liking the pacing of his novels, the characters doing what is right despite the odds being stacked against them, and Grisham's easy writing style that provided enough detail to sympathize with the underdogs but never crossed into too much familiarity. So when I came across the paperback of The Broker memories did their thing and the book came home with me. It sat on the shelf through my well-intentioned \"reading schedule\" phase, got passed over a couple of times after that until finally I was in the mood for it. Almost immediately I saw that either my memories were flawed or The Broker didn't fit in with the Grisham novels I read. In the beginning there was a lot of backstory setting the scene for Joel Backman's release from prison. It painted him as a ruthless, greedy man unfamiliar with the very concept of morality, and even as freedom was offered to him after years in solitary confinement in conditions that were clearly meant to break him he accepted it as if it was his due. And then Joel was moved to Italy and with the new clothes and a pair of Armani glasses he seemed to take on a new identity in more than just name - still demanding and knowing exactly what he wanted, he at the same time has acquired an appreciation for the simpler things in life, and seemed to have re-evaluated his past and was determined to live differently. Unfortunately this transformation got almost no page time, it was more or less just there, leaving the reader to arrive at their own conclusions as to how Joel got from point A to point B. Pacing left much to be desired as well. Events rolled along leisurely for about three quarters of the book with Joel endlessly going from Italian lessons to meals and back, and things started to feel a bit like Groundhog Day, until in a blink of an eye our protagonist transformed from a frustrated tourist into a man of action masterminding his true freedom and once again manipulating some of the highest powers in Washington into doing his bidding. This transition, though not unexpected, was so sudden and swift that it almost gave me whiplash and once again left me with a sense of dissatisfaction.My favorite scenes in the book were where Joel was shown adjusting to life in Italy. His first attempts to order food in a foreign language, his growing familiarity with Bologna, even his overwhelming drive to learn Italian made him into a sympathetic character despite his thoroughly unsympathetic past. I really could do with more of that because I think it would develop the characters and the book wouldn't feel so much like a chronology of events past and present.All in all it was a decent read and I was glad for the way things turned out. I just wish it was more fleshed out in every aspect.

Known as \"the broker,\" Backman was a high roller--a lawyer making $10 million a year who could \"open any door in Washington.\" That is, until he tried to broker a deal selling access to the world's most powerful satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. When caught, Backman accepted prison as the one option that would keep him safe and alive, since the interested parties (the Israelis, the Saudis, the Russians, and the Chinese) were all itching to get their hands on his secrets at any cost. Little does he know that his own government has designs on accessing that information--or at least letting it die with him. Now, six years after his incarceration, the director of the CIA convinces a lame duck president to pardon Backman, and the broker becomes a free man--and an open target.\n\nThe Broker marries the best of John Grisham's many talents--his ability to immerse himself in the culture of small town life (in this case, Bologna, Italy), and his uncanny mastery of the chase. The first half of the book focuses on Backman's transformation from infamous power broker to helpless victim in his own game. Upon his release from prison, Backman is taken into \"protective custody\" and whisked off to Italy where he is assigned a new identity, and a tutor to help him blend in. Sure he is on the run, but some readers may feel that Backman's time spent in Bologna is a bit too leisurely--readers join him on an almost cinematic tour through the Italian town, complete with language and history lessons. Impatient readers will be happy to know that the final half of the novel is classic Grisham--a fast-paced, thrilling cat and mouse chase pitting Backman against the numerous agencies that want him dead--as the broker makes a move to take back his life. --Daphne Durham\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nReaders will find an amiable travelogue to Italy and its charms in Grisham's latest. What they won't find are the suspense and inspired plotting that have made the author (The Last Juror, etc.) one of the world's bestselling writers. Yet Grisham remains a smooth storyteller, and few will fail to finish this oddball tale of what happens to ruined D.C. powerbroker Joel Blackman, 52, when he's suddenly released from federal prison after six years. Teddy Maynard, legendary CIA director, has engineered the release in order to put Joel into a variant of the witness protection program and then see who kills him. Many want him dead\u2014the Saudis, the Israelis, especially the Chinese\u2014because of his role in trying to sell a global satellite spy system that would alter the world's balance of power; that was what got Joel imprisoned, and the CIA hopes that whoever kills him will clue them in to who may have access to the satellites. Joel is relocated to Bologna, and much of the narrative consists of his touring that city, its historic sights and its many restaurants, and learning Italian ways from his male handler, Luigi, and his language tutor, Francesca\u2014a middle-aged woman with whom he falls in love. A major subplot concerns Joel's secret dealings with his stateside son to prepare for escape from Bologna if necessary. Eventually, the CIA leaks Joel's whereabouts to his enemies, who dispatch killing teams. Can Joel broker his way to safety? There's some depth to the troubled relationship between Joel and his tutor, but otherwise the novel reads like a contented afterthought to a memorable Italian vacation, with little action or tension, plastic characters and plot turns that a tricycle could maneuver. Still, anyone wishing to learn how and why Bologna built its famed porticos, why to be wary of most Italian desserts and how to send an encrypted wireless message using a global cell phone will find that information cheerfully given here.

Not the page turning thriller I had been expecting, and honestly it felt like he had a short-story length idea, and padded it out with much bimbling around Italy to get it up to novel length.The plot is that the broker - bigwig lobbyist lawyer in Washington - got involved in the sale of a satellite hacking programme and ended up in prison. The CIA desperately want to know whose satellite was being hacked and who was going to buy the programme, so they get the outgoing president to pardon Backman, get him released from prison and sent to Italy to start a new life. With the intention that they'll let the world's secret services know his whereabouts and then sit and watch who kills him.Now, to a point it was interesting to read about and think about what it would be like to be taken away from EVERYTHING and expected to set up a new life and identity in a country and a language you don't know. That coupled with a sense of the place and the tension of not knowing if you're being hunted would be the kind of thing a writer like Patricia Highsmith would have done brilliantly. But I don't think this is Grisham's forte at all, and it just got dull at times. I thought more would have been made of his professor friend as well, although that's just a random pondering on my part.It is also so American in that everything's refered to as \"European\" as if Europe is just one homogenous blob and we all live our lives and attitudes exactly the same. Which felt wierd when characters that were supposed to be Italien would say things about this is the \"European Way\". Do Italiens speak like that? We certainly don't in the UK - and Brexit politics aside, folks - EU membership regardless, we are still part of Europe geographically.I've only ever read one other Grisham book, The Street Lawyer, which was a lot of years ago and I remembering enjoying.

On the surface the set-up is not at all bad. An ex-lobbyist gone bad with some big secrets is released from jail and bundled off to a pretty place in Italy by the CIA. Their intention is that he should be killed away from the US but so that they get to see who did it.* He spends the next few weeks of his life desperately trying to learn Italian and work out exactly why he is there. At some point he starts to become a man wholly different from that which he was in his previous brash and soulless earllier life. I would guess that his 6 years in prison might have been also relevant for that but for interest purposes I can see that the author decides concentrate on the short spell in Italy.The problem is that the set-up is all this book has.It felt like jumping out of a top floor window only to find that the ground is right there 2 feet below the window. In between times nothing much happens and you find yourself bored enough to notice the books more obvious flaws.First and foremost there is the plot: endless pointless episodes that neither develop the plot or the character. The situation on page 300 is broadly the same as that one page 20. In between we learn Italian, eat some nice food and have coffee.Closely linked with these plot issues is the narrative style. Episode...and then...dull episode...and then...dull episode....and then nothing exciting happens. It is as if the author thinks that to be genuinely European he has to slow everything down and concentrate on the small things. Problem is, he has absolutely no idea how to do that well.Joel was a bad man and then he went to Italy and then he wasn't so bad and then he studied Italian and then he had some nice pasta and then he studied Italian some more and then he was being chased by lots of bad men and then he met a woman and then he studied Italian again and then he got smart and then he went home and then maybe he was alright. Nothing happens and then it does. And then it moves to another place and then something else small happens. And then there is no suspense. And then he is never in any peril. And then who is this mysterious Chinese assassin and what torture will he inflict? And then we never find out. And then I got bored and then I had a cup of tea and then \"ooh isn't this Italian food lovely\" and then Bologna is, like, full of, like, old things and then the women are ALL pretty in Italy (really, is there some sort of infant euthanasia programme for those unfortunately ugly humans who happen to be born in Italy?) and then they all smoke and then they all kiss each other (even the men, uggh gross!) and then they take time to eat lots more of that lovely food and then we all had tea and cake. Oh and then we have a little bit of action and then not too much and then it ends.Finally there is the lack of any coherent moral stand point. There is no doubt that the author is attempting to consider how power corrupts and the effects of an empty but financially rewarding career on the individual. Perhaps rather than getting so stressed we should all smell the flowers, look at the architecture and have a coffee in a Piazza. However, this is completely negated by a series of later crass money-posturing scenes reminiscent of the \"spraying money around is soooo cooool\" 1980's. Look at me, I can impress a Swiss banker! Well glory be.In summary, a tedious plot padded out with the narrative style of an essay written by an average ten year old mixed with the sort of gross and confused stereotyping found in the very dumbest American descriptions of all things European. No offense to the many Americans who know better but wow, this almost beats \"The Tourist\" film for misunderstanding Europe, it really is that bad. *As it happens, on reflection this part of the plot is wholly nonsensical: since all of them are trying to kill him it does not follow that the winning assassin would come from the country who owns the satellite system. In fact, to hide ones ownership of a satellite system, it is unlikely that one would kill an ex-political lobbyist in some sort of revenge/ secret hiding exercise. Oh and why Italy? And why teach him Italian?

Nobody even knew of the system's top secret existence (let alone who was operating it) until two brilliant Pakistani computer wizards unwittingly hacked into the system and parlayed that illicit entry into an astonishing piece of software capable of hijacking, manipulating and neutralizing the system. When greed and human nature drive these naive programmers into the arms of Washington power broker, Joel Backman, to ask for his help in shopping the knowledge of the clandestine satellite system and their superlative software package to the highest bidder, the best laid plans of mice and men and crafty programmers and Washington lawyers are smashed into a million tiny pieces. The hapless young hackers are assassinated and never seen from again and Joel Backman is indicted and hidden away in prison on some nebulous but entirely bogus conspiracy and treason charges. The reputation of his multi-million dollar legal firm is shattered, his partner commits suicide (maybe?) and his son's reputation is left in tatters. The story really begins in earnest when a cynical, conniving director of the CIA and an unscrupulous outgoing president hatch an idea to solve the continuing puzzle of who owns Neptune. Grant Backman a pardon, create a false identity for him in another country, be a little less than 100% efficient in guarding this identity and location and, finally, sit back to see who comes gunning for him! Joel Backman's character as a man, a failed father, a wealthy lawyer and power broker, a broken prisoner, a driven student of culture and language and a newly minted caring lover is exceptionally well-developed. Francesca Ferro, his language tutor, is equally well crafted and a wonderfully detailed study of an enigmatic and sophisticated but very human European woman. While its fundamental premise is a tad over the top and registers a little low on the credibility meter, THE BROKER is an enjoyable spy vs spy suspense thriller with the legal overtones for which Grisham is so well known. It's a cautionary tale that warns of the dangers of power without checks, balances and accountability. It's a dark and sinister story that should terrify readers about the extent to which an unscrupulous government spy agency will go, ostensibly in the interests of national security. Finally, and perhaps this will be quite difficult to believe, it is also a charming low-key romance and a wonderfully informative travelogue on Italian life in the city of Bologna. By the bye, THE BROKER also relates an exceptionally interesting narrative of the difficulties of cultural assimilation and learning a foreign language. As surprising as the juxtaposition of these story components may be, Grisham has pulled it all off quite effortlessly. It's not a combination that will work and be of interest to every reader but I found it thoroughly enjoyable and charming at the same time as it was exciting. THE BROKER is a fine addition to Grisham's already excellent and well-stocked body of work. Highly recommended.

After losing his re-election in a historic defeat, outgoing President Arthur Morgan grants one final pardon to Joel Backman, who is quietly smuggled out of America with a new name and identity, and forced to live in Italy. He is unaware, however, that the CIA has also leaked information about his whereabouts to a number of foreign countries who want Backman dead for various reasons involved with his crimes, putting this corrupt broker on a desperate path to stay alive.I was very eager to read this book considering I was aware of John Grisham's massive success as a writer of mystery and thriller, and that the only other book I had read of his up until now was a lesser-known piece of work called 'Playing for Pizza,' which was very different from most of his other works and nothing anyone would recommend to a first-time reader of his. I was eager to read a book of his that fell in line with his forte, and while I do not believe 'The Broker' is a terrible book, I was unable to give it more than 1 star because I ultimately stopped reading the book because I lost interest in the story, and per my usual rules, books I drop automatically receive one star.'The Broker' does have the distinction of being the only 'dropped' book of mine where I skipped ahead to read the final two chapters to see the ending. I'll probably do this in other dropped books just for some assurance that the author at least had the ability to structure their book in a way that led to a cohesive endpoint and strong conclusion. I would say 'The Broker' passed this test, even though I undoubtedly missed some intriguing climax somewhere in the third act.My biggest complaint with 'The Broker' is how it fails to deliver on the promise it gives the reader. If you read the synopsis I wrote at the beginning of this review, or the actual synopsis on its Goodreads page, you would be inclined to think this book would focus primarily on this criminal's desperate struggle to stay alive despite the staggering number of people who want him dead for reasons you, the reader, don't know about and are curious to know. That's what I went in expecting, and the first few chapters (fifty to sixty pages, or so) do a fantastic job at getting you invested. We're introduced to this broker whose name alone is enough to draw suspicion, we know he's dangerous but we don't know why, and we know there are several people who want him dead. I was on board with the story from the first chapter and I wanted to learn more, but sadly the rest of the book fails to capitalize on that in several ways.For example, there is a substantial amount of the book's second act that involves Joel trying to learn to speak Italian. I was obviously expecting the transition from life in an American prison to a secret new life in a foreign country to be a jarring experience and that some time would be taken for Joel to grapple with his new way of living, but Oh. My. God. Half of this book, to me, felt like Joel was trying to learn to speak Italian. That is not an exaggeration. Each time a chapter ended I expected that to be the last scene Grisham would spend developing Backman in this way, and that the story was about to delve into the assassination attempts and the dark, corrupt history I wanted to know more about, but pretty soon it all just became scene after scene of Joel wandering around Italy practicing Italian and I just did not care at all about any of this. The most interesting chapters in this section of the book are actually set back in America, going over things that happen with the former president, vice president, and backstories about what happened before Joel was even sent to prison. I often asked myself if these subplots and backstories would have been a better starting point for the book than the one Grisham wrote, and I ultimately decided they would be.I myself am an aspiring author. I have a rule for myself that I ascribe that a writer shouldn't make a reader wait for a story to get interesting. You can't write a book that relies entirely on some amazing third act climax or plot twist and expect your readers will slog through the first half of your book just to find out what happens, because people don't always finish reading books. Every chapter, every scene, every paragraph even, needs to keep some kind of intrigue or tension, but sadly there is so much this book that just felt like it was stalling until something interesting happened later. This is a book that has a lot of secrets. There's a lot of information that's hidden from the reader to create intrigue which I felt really ruined the pacing of the story because it kept me so unaware of so many things for too long that I eventually lost that spark and didn't have any reason to keep reading. More importantly, I actually found myself not really caring what happened, which is the most important thing a book needs to do. I asked myself halfway through reading this book if I cared whether or not Joel lived or died, and I honestly didn't have a preference. There are very few outright likable characters in this book. That's not a problem for me, since there are plenty of books, shows, and movies like 'House of Cards' or 'The Godfather' that are highly acclaimed and get audiences to root for characters who are criminals with a lust for power and wealth, but the reason why these characters are so captivating is because of their motivation. They want respect, and they want power, the same things most of us dream of having, and so watching them has an almost cathartic appeal. Joel Backman doesn't have this charisma because he really doesn't want anything except to stay alive, so when he isn't desperately fighting for his life every chapter the story loses its tension, which causes the pacing to drag, and ultimately, the story itself is ruined.Without giving any spoilers, I know from a quick exchange in the final chapter that Backman's life was saved at some point, which I'm sure means that there was some near-death heart-pounding climax in the third act that I missed, and it probably reveals the true nature of Backman's crimes that were eluded to in the beginning. I trust John Grisham is smart enough to craft a story that at least leads to conclusion. But I don't give books points because they explain a mystery\u2014that should be a given. I don't care about plot continuity as much as I care about how invested I am in knowing what happens next, and halfway through reading this book I decided I wasn't. The lack of tension, motivation, and the multiple POV shifts left me with so many scenes in which I didn't know what was relevant and all of Grisham's brilliant work in the first few chapters just fizzled out and suddenly I felt like I wasn't reading a story so much as waiting for an ending.Despite my mostly negative thoughts on this book, I was impressed by Grisham's skill at crafting clever dialogue and definitely the signs of his talent. I would be interested in reading one of his more well-known books so I can get a better taste of him. Maybe I'll get a copy of 'The Pelican Brief' if I get the chance. Even after giving a bad review, I'm always willing to be impressed.Thank you for reading!", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["dropped", "reviewed", "john-grisham", "pacing-issues", "1-star", "mystery"]}, {"book_id_title": "1110.The_Broker", "book_id": "1110", "book_title": "The Broker", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3889463675", "review_id": "3889463675", "date": "Mar 14, 2021", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Josh Olds", "user_url": "/user/show/6256485-josh-olds", "text": "I can only assume that, sometime in 2004, John Grisham vacationed in Italy and it left an impression. In two back-to-back books\u20142005\u2019s The Broker and 2007\u2019s Playing for Pizza\u2014Grisham uses Italy as his backdrop, giving readers quite a different setting than what we\u2019re used to from him. Joel Backman is considered to one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington, but with great power comes a good chance that someone\u2019s going to screw you over. When a shady deal he\u2019s brokering goes south, Backman\u2019s left holding the bag and sent to prison. Six years later, there are other certain unknown interests who want to know what Backman knows. For national security reasons, the US government wants to know who wants to know, so they set up a plan to use Backman as bait. He gets a full pardon on the condition he leave the country, and then they wait to see who tries to kill him. The middle part of the book moves from thriller to tourism, as Grisham slows down to revel in the details of Bologna, Italy. A fair part of the book is simply a suspicious but unknowing Backman getting used to a new country, language, and name. Slowly but surely, he realizes that the CIA has had ulterior motives all along. Backman manages to survive several assassination attempts, confirming his suspicions, and it all leads to one final brokered deal.The Broker is a wannabe spy novel that instead spends much of its time reading like an American Yankee in the Pope\u2019s Court. Grisham\u2019s descriptions are vivid and engaging, but do nothing to further the plot. The middle of the book is supposed to be the meat, but Grisham simply strings us along to the end. It\u2019s like he didn\u2019t know what to do once he got his main character to Italy but, by golly, let\u2019s sit down and enjoy the sights a bit. Hilariously, for all the book\u2019s attempt at being a travel guide, it isn\u2019t even a particularly good one, sporting more than a few inaccuracies. Usually, you can brush this aside as creative license, but none of the inaccuracies are\u2026well\u2026creative. They\u2019re just incorrect facts that have no bearing on the story and, since the story seems intent on telling us a lot about Bologna, I have to critique it on those grounds. The thriller/spy element to the story is a bit far-fetched and doesn\u2019t come across as believable, leading to an ending that could have just as easily happened from the outset, avoiding all the drama to begin with. The Broker is one of those novels that you can applaud Grisham for in trying to step out of the genre that made him famous, but it\u2019s really just a reminder that Grisham is really good at one thing and most of his attempts outside of fictional courtrooms have been anemic at best.

The synopsis did not particularly grab my attention; being stuck in the covid-19 lockdown, I am working through my collection of books and decided to give it a go....Whereas the previous books I have read of John Grisham, were mostly lawyer/court room based, this one revolved around politics and espionage.I think as my expectations of this book were quite low (as afore mentioned the synopsis did not particularly appeal), I was pleasantly surprised to find myself engaged in the storyline. The premise of the story is set around a \u2018lobbyist\u2019 who was jailed for trying to sell a programme that controls satellite intelligence.

However, I enjoyed the espionage side of the book, when the CIA work to smuggle out Joel Backman and set him up with a new life. Rather that glossing over what this might actually be like - to be pardoned for a crime, be released 14 years early from prison and then whisked to a new country and life - Grisham took the Joel on a journey of emotions - the fear of the unknown, the frustrations of having his life dictated by the CIA agents, the contrast of this new life to his previous high-flying existence and in solitary confinement in prison. Bearing in mind, Joel had committed a crime and before he went to prison he was greedy, selfish, demanding...etc, I had very little sympathy or empathy for him, however through Grisham\u2019s developing of his character I found myself sympathising with Joel, and hoping he is able to outwit the CIA and those wanting to kill him. In some of Grisham\u2019s books that I\u2019ve read, I find I neither care or engage with the characters when reading, so for me this seemed an improvement.I think the ending felt a bit abrupt for me - there were a few unanswered questions and incomplete storylines when the book came to an end.

It\u2019s uncanny how so many authors have a knack for predicting the future. Anyway, the CIA, who secured Backman\u2019s pardon, hides him for a while in Italy until they are ready to release him to the wolves for slaughter. The problem is that they have to keep an eye on him, because they want to find out who wants Backman dead. Then the CIA will know who launched some very sophisticated surveillance satellites whose software Backman\u2019s Pakistani contacts hacked. Backman, true to his nickname, had brokered a deal with the Saudis for the software that takes control of the satellites, but pleaded guilty when his scheme was discovered, and all of his fellow schemers wound up dead. The storyline becomes a little tedious while Backman, in his witness protection of sorts, is studying Italian with a CIA-supplied tutor, eating scrumptious food, and exploring centuries-old cathedrals. However, the frenetic finale more than makes up for this short pause in the action. Obviously, Backman\u2019s deeds brand him as an opportunist without a moral compass, but Grisham lures us into rooting for him nonetheless. Maybe we are willing dupes because Backman\u2019s handlers are so much more despicable. Given Backman\u2019s reputation and history, it\u2019s hard to fathom why his son, whose own legal career Backman virtually destroyed, would willingly help him.

Six years later, he's pardoned by a president on the way out, and the assassins who were after him over half a decade ago are gunning for him again.Where BROKER differs is the type of stakes involved. The CIA sends Joel to Bologna, Italy, a city and country where he knows no one, doesn't speak the language, and has no money to survive. He depends on the government, but he suspects that same government of shipping him him out of the US so they can sit back and wait to see which of the assassins get to him first and force him to spill his guts about the secrets he's kept for the past six years before killing them.Before prison, Joel was reprehensible. He ran through wives like they were toilet paper, ignored his kids, and never bothered to meet his grandkids.

In the meantime Joel is still trying to figure out why he was let out of prison 1 years early. He is very leary of every one. The CIA is watching Joel to see who is going to kill him first. Eventually Joel thoughts come true and he figures out that someone is after him. So on the run he goes and eventualky he comes full circle and ends up back in DC--the place where he was before he ended up in prison. I liked this book but had a hard time getting into it at some points. There was the suspense of who was going to find Joel first and kill him...also eventually some love interest. The kegal aspect of most Grisham books there as Joel was an atty, but was more of a power broker in DC than practicing law.

All is not as rosy as it seems because Teddy Maynard, legendary CIA Director wants him free in order to see who will kill him. It seems that Blackman's downfall was trying to broker/sell a satellite spy system that was better than anything the U.S. had. He is put into a witness protection program in Italy with his handler, Luigi. The idea is that, after he's adjusted to Italy and learned the language and the customs, he will be cut loose and watched to see who comes after him, the Russians, the Israelis, the Saudis or the Chinese. Supposedly that will lead the CIA to the creator of the system. I had a hard time with the reasoning since everyone associated with its theft had been murdered and still, no one knew where it came from.Blackman's justified paranoia serves him well and he is able to confound his handlers so that he can be truly free. In a sub-plot, he falls in love with Francesca his middle-aged language teacher. With the help of his son, Neal, Blackman puts his plan to save himself in motion. As the story progresses, Blackman realizes what a jerk he had been chasing money and power to the exclusion of everything else in his life. He's still a very clever operator but he begins to develop a more humane side. While there are not a lot of surprises, Blackman's efforts to escape his fate are interesting and provide what suspense the book holds. The book is an enjoyable way to pass time. I read most of it while traveling. There are other far more exciting Grisham books. Nevertheless, I can recommend this effort as a fun read.

However though, I found it a little bit boring when Francesca shared the history of each building they visited, simply because I'm not interested in any building's history.Also, imo, Grisham could make the ending longer, since at the end of the book I felt the urge to say \"that's it?\" but considering majority of his books are the hanging ending, so yeah.But overall it's fun!", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1110.The_Broker", "book_id": "1110", "book_title": "The Broker", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2765854638", "review_id": "2765854638", "date": "Oct 10, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Neil McAllister", "user_url": "/user/show/95232324-neil-mcallister", "text": "One of my favourite Grisham books. Some reviews describe the middle section of the book as filler, but if so it is very enjoyable filler as the main character explores his world and realises more and more what is going on.The whole idea of the plot, while rather implausible, is really interesting. The book is basically a slow paced thriller where the main character is unaware for much of it that he's in the middle of a thriller.If you want non-stop action, then it will disappoint, but if you enjoy something a bit slower paced then you may enjoy it.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fiction"]}]
