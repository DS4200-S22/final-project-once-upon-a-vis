I have no idea what that reason would be, because I thought Angels & Demons was mediocre so I never bothered to read the The DaVinci Code. Anyway, I was bored and a copy of this was sitting at the library for a quarter and I thought \"WTF, mate, I'll give it a go.\"The first page of chapter 1 starts with Susan Fletcher waking from a romantic dream to the ringing of the telephone:\"Susan, it's David. Did I wake you?\"She smiled, rolling over in bed. \"I was just dreaming of you. Come over and play.\"He laughed. \"It's still dark out.\"\"Mmm.\" She moaned sensuously. \"Then definitely come over and play. We can sleep in before we head north.\"That is not a transcription typo, or the manifestation of my unfocused rage. It really does read '\"Mmm.\" She moaned sensuously.' Please feel free to vomit if you need to; I'll wait.David then proceeds to postpone their plans to celebrate their six-month engagement due to something hush-hush, like maybe his being a big homo. C'mon, what sort of man is going to pass up some sweet, sweet lovin' from his woman before disappearing on a mystery mission? The kind who likes other men, that's what kind. A handful of pages later, it becomes clear that Dan Brown has read too many Clive Cussler novels as we're treated to a description of David Becker:\"Becker was dark--a rugged, youthful thirty-five with sharp green eyes and a wit to match. His strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan of carved marble. Over six feet tall, Becker moved across a squash court faster than any of his colleagues could comprehend. After soundly beating his opponent, he would cool off by dousing his head in a drinking fountain and soaking his tuft of thick, black hair. Then, still dripping, he'd treat his opponent to a fruit shake and a bagel.\"Is it just me or does this read like Dan Brown was typing this with one hand? Why does Mr. Stud have the same initials as the author? Why would anyone want a sharp green wit? And is 'fruit shake' some sort of code for a handy? Is that why he is still dripping?So then, after all this ran through my immature little mind, I remembered I had other books to read--books that didn't suck horrifically within the first ten pages. Yay for other books!Oh, and I sold it to a used book shop for a dollar, so it was worth the quarter.

Not as good as Angels and Demons and The da Vinci code, but not as bad as The lost symbol, Digital fortress is the career start of a novelist who used good oldfashioned knowledge in a unique, new way on his way to literary immortality. The art part is small in this one, as it\u00b4s more of a technothriller than the more blockbuster mystery high speed pursuit style of the following novels.One can see that Brown is still tinkering around with his writing style, not always sure where to go and more trying to go futuristic and techy than uchronic and historic. I am heavily biased towards anything Sci-Fi, so I do definitively just give 4 stars because of the setting, without it, it would be closer to a 3.It\u00b4s very funny that the infamous \u201eI don\u00b4t care about technical accuracy, have no interest in research, and don\u00b4t ask experts to proofread\u201c mentality is already big in this one, Brown just doesn\u00b4t care, the cryptography and tech are hilariously facepalmy. In this case, it\u00b4s even more extreme, as it are not just some elements as in the other novels, but the whole plot revolving around topics Brown obviously has no knowledge about, making it unwittingly comedic.But one also has to have the courage to publish a novel and just don\u00b4t caring about it, it\u00b4s a special kind of badass attitude and effrontery I appreciate (sorry for that, the dark side strong in me is), although it\u00b4s very cheeky and transports false knowledge into poor readers\u00b4minds. Bonus points for showing the NSA in a shady light in the year 1998 (and not in 2013, when it became soooo mainstream) and letting his protagonists dealing with the topics of privacy, protection, and the rule of the surveillance, pardon Freudian typo, of course constitutional state.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...", "num_likes": 162, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["brown-dan"]}, {"book_id_title": "11125.Digital_Fortress", "book_id": "11125", "book_title": "Digital Fortress", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/68942489", "review_id": "68942489", "date": "Aug 26, 2009", "rating": 3, "user_name": "K.D. Absolutely", "user_url": "/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "text": "I work in the Information Technology field so relating to this book was easy for me. I don\u2019t know anything about NSA (National Security Agency) and how they operate but I know stuff like encryption, algorithm, anagram, computer virus, code-breaking, etc. So, this book glued me from start to finish. My officemate has been telling me that this is his favorite Dan Brown book. He said that since I\u2019ve read all his 4 other novels, The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Deception Point (all 3 stars, i.e., I liked them!) and The Lost Symbol (2 stars, i.e., It\u2019s okay!) and I am glad that I finally read this book. Hurray, I am now a Dan Brown completist! I liked the story. NSA has a program that can track personal conversations around the world. One employee gets angry so he becomes a whistleblower. NSA hires a pretty detective (not yet Robert Langdon since this is Dan Brown\u2019s first novel) and she is so hot most of the male characters in this book lust for her. This lust for her body and for power (as usual) basically becomes the driving force for all these men to outwit or kill each other or even themselves. The plot is a little overpopulated by characters and the twists are a bit too many to become coincidental. However, this is Dan Brown\u2019s first novel so they are expected. Just like any other first time novelists, Brown was trying to prove that he could intricately weave a suspenseful yet unbelievable plot.Wikipedia says that this book was based on real-life incident in cryptography. The story seems to tell me that Dan Brown not only did his thorough research on the topic but was also able to anticipate what NSA would do. He was a step ahead of NSA or maybe the NSA was influenced by the book. This one was not coincidence, I think. Or maybe Dan Brown was clever enough to befriend an insider in NSA. I just did not have any idea how a novelist could have access to NSA. Or maybe I am reading too many suspense-thriller books (Robert Ludlum, Jeffrey Archer, Ken Follett, John Grisham, etc) that my rational thinking is now tainted with all these far-fetched possibilities or thoughts.Dan Brown was born on the same year I was, i.e., 1964. His books have been translated in many languages and stayed in New York\u2019s Bestsellers\u2019 List and adapted into big movie blockbusters. Wimps cannot do just those. I like Dan Brown definitely not for his literary prowess, i.e., his writing is ordinary, but for his imagination and the efforts that he put in his research. He just does not sit down and types away his thoughts. He backs those up with facts. He goes to the museums in Paris or Capital Building, looks up on all the writings or symbols on the wall, paintings, towers. He reads history and current events and incorporates those to his plot. So, let\u2019s spare this guy from our senseless tirades. We just cannot ignore the fact that he knows his trade. His books deserve to be read. His efforts deserve to be appreciated.

He doesn\u2019t write my type of fiction, so while I was aware that he\u2019s a huge success, I never bothered to pick any of his books up because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be interested.What I didn\u2019t know is how much of a shit writer he is.I\u2019m sure he cries into a giant pile of money every single time someone tells him that. Digital Fortress is about the government and secrecy. Susan Fletcher works for a super top secret government agency called NSA that cracks codes to read emails and save the world. How do I remember that her name is Susan Fletcher? Susan Fletcher is referred to as Susan Fletcher on every page that Susan Fletcher appears on. Apparently Brown is worried that people won\u2019t remember that Susan Fletcher is one of the main character is his book Digital Fortress by Dan Brown.Susan Fletcher is the best code breaker NSA has. Susan Fletcher is also beautiful and perfect and everyone loves her and wants to do her. Susan Fletcher has a brilliant mind. Susan Fletcher is also very attractive. Susan Fletcher is also smart. People look at Susan Fletcher and think to themselves \u201cHow does an IQ of 170 fit into a body that attractive? I am going to think more of these thoughts so that the reader of Dan Brown\u2019s Digital Fortress will know what Susan Fletcher looks like in the book Digital Fortress by Dan Brown.\u201dYour first drinking game is to take a shot every time someone chuckles.Your next drinking game is to empty a Red Solo Cup every time someone\u2019s eyes are described as strong hazel, deep green, inky black, sable, gray, or any other color that barely exists in real life. Yes, people do have these eyes, and apparently they all live in Dan Brown\u2019s world. Dan Brown wrote the book Digital Fortress.If you do not drink and are into health, do push ups or squats or something instead of pounding booze. Either way, we\u2019re all going to crumple to the floor and throw up.When Susan Fletcher is called in to work on a Saturday by Commander Strathmore, head of NSA, Susan Fletcher knows that something must be very wrong. Susan Fletcher was supposed to be on a vacation with her finance David Becker. David Becker is beautiful and smart. David Becker plays squash and no one minds when David Becker puts his entire head into the water fountain to wash away the sweat. David Becker is that amazing.Turns out that the Commander has sent David Becker, Susan Fletcher\u2019s finance, to Spain, even though David Becker does not work for NSA. Susan Fletcher thinks thoughts to tell the reader how important NSA is.Seriously, how is this guy a big name writer? I just don\u2019t get it.Dan Brown, the author of Digital Fortress, does not have time for important things like \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d when it comes to writing his books. Dan Brown wants to get to the important things like telling the reader how intelligent and beautiful Susan Fletcher and David Becker are. Susan Fletcher and David Becker are engaged. Susan Fletcher and David Becker have been engaged for six months. Susan Fletcher tells David Becker this when she says \u201cYou do remember we\u2019re engaged, don\u2019t you?\u201d which is exactly what people in real life would say if they wanted to let you know that they were engaged.Susan Fetcher stays underground in the NSA bunker trying to figure out what is wrong with their giant, enormous, massive, expensive, costly, top secret, classified translator project. The computer is used to cull through email and crack codes and save the entire planet. It has done so successfully. But now it has found a code that it cannot crack and Susan Fletcher has to use her beautiful body and intelligent mind to solve the problem.Meanwhile, in Spain, David Becker is on a crazy journey of his own. He has to find a ring because it somehow has something to do with this code. He is able to follow thin clues to track the ring from person to person. Apparently David Becker, with no training (because if he had training, someone in the book Digital Fortress by Dan Brown, would have told us about it) becomes the world\u2019s most brilliant detective. Oh, and also David Becker is given stupid coincidences that tell him where to go next. David Becker is smart and is able to use these giant arrows to find the next person to talk to.Of course everything turns out to be suspicious and there\u2019s lots of traitors and threats from every side. One thing I did like about the book Digital Fortress, written by Dan Brown, is that there were parts where I honestly didn\u2019t know who the bad guy was. Luckily Dan Brown quickly tells information to make me pay attention to a specific character in his book Digital Fortress and I, the reader, can get back to the important part which is remembering that Susan Fletcher and David Becker are engaged and they are both very intelligent and very beautiful.The crazy ending was kind of fun because everyone was in the same place sort of screaming and trying to solve the problem before the entire government was shut down, but other than that\u2026 What the fuck, America? This is one of our top selling authors?In conclusion, I did not like the book Digital Fortress by Dan Brown. Not only do I not care for this type of story, I could not get past the writing. How does this happen?I don\u2019t care if this makes me sound like a book snob, but seriously, this is who we\u2019ve chosen as one of our Must Read Authors? For fuck\u2019s sake.My book group meets tomorrow and I\u2019m bringing a giant list of discussion questions. Apparently they all hated the book too, including the two people who suggested it for this month.

The plot, if dissected, would resemble this: a career girl (& therefore, one lacking of a personality, other than being described as being incredibly fond of expensive shoes [as if such an example would underscore her femininity:]) stuck in a compound, perplexed by computer screens and consoles, hurrying to save humanity before the doomsday clock strikes; her boyfriend, a prof. with sure and extreme luck out on a wild goose chase (in--Sevilla, Spain! AWESUM!), a fish out of water with a blind purpose (and again, afflicted with the No Personality Syndrome along with his contemporary drones); and other tech nerds, out trying to physically or technologically (whatever that means... the novel tries to personify what's intangible: cyberspace) um, save the planet. There are codes and puzzles along the way, easy to decipher and sometimes overly-explained by these tech- (and only tech-) minded, overpaid, individuals.Because it was educational, fun, sometimes (I say this with a grain of salt) unpredictable, it should be read.

I am now up to date and awaiting whatever comes next (outside his newer children's release). I enjoy thrillers and suspense novels, but I haven't figured out my favorite authors in this genre yet. I'm determined to make that a 2021 reading goal. Before I head there, let's chat about this book.Published in 1998, the key thing readers must remember is that if you're devouring it now, remember how much technology and security has changed in the last two decades. Much of the theory and approach is different today, and while you don't need to understand technology to enjoy the book, it helps... and if you know a bit about it (I work in the field), you will feel a different connection. I admit fully, it was a little too technical at times... not that I didn't understand it, but I couldn't focus on the story.Overall, the plot is intriguing. A man dies, he threatened to reveal all the US secrets from the NSA site. He had a virus and an unbreakable code. What that actually means is very different from what we come to learn in the book. I was excited to solve the very last puzzle and work out the answer on my own... so that was a nice ending.The main character is a female technologist working for a male head of the NSA (okay two male heads, one is African American, one is Caucasian). So, right from the beginning, I was glad to see the diversity and that it was somewhat ahead of its times. Nonetheless, she is engaged and her husband-to-be is involved in the plot. A few trips through Europe, a political nightmare, and lots of fiery explosions. And some murders too!I'll go with a 3.5 rounded up here. Mostly, the plot is stretched. There is no reason the main character's fianc\u00e9 needed to be the one to go to Spain. It felt like a plot device... which I don't mind, if he truly was qualified and we got to know him more. That said, I felt like we got to know him better than the main character too. She was smart and highly qualified, and she kicked butt several times, but I knew nothing about her personally. I felt a bit too distanced.The villain dies immediately. Or one of them. So that was a different experience. But all the engaging, quick dialog and action scenes are spot on. It shows why he evolved into a great writer.Of all his books, probably in the bottom half of my faves... but still one to read if you like these types of novels.

I've always liked Dan Brown's books because he writes so realistically, using big words to belittle readers about how little they know.Or so I thought.After reading this book, I did a little snooping of my own (OK, those were big words too, I just used Google) and realised that most of the technology, computers and cool machinery did not exist. In fact, Goodreads was an excellent source of information of unhappy reviewers tearing down this book's credibility. Gee, I was really hoping that those stuff were as cool as mentioned in Digital Fortress.But that asides, there are some historical facts and figures that ARE real, if not as cool. NSA. Cryptology. Enigma. Although I can't say that Brown's books are an excellent crash course for a myriad of whacky subjects, his writings definitely introduced readers to an entirely whole new world that most of us would have otherwise never have dreamt about.Having that said, I can't say that Brown's writing style is my favourite. His books usually start off well, but kind of go downhill somewhat at the end. His plot developments are not the best I've come across, although how he comes up with them in the bloody first place is unthinkable. But I must say, there is a significant similarity between the plots in most, if not all, of his books. It doesn't take a cryptologist to figure it out. Now before this I've only read 3 of his books (OK that may be quite a lot already) and my recent awareness of such similarity has indeed taken out most surprises within Brown's novels.No spoiler here, though I'm sure most of us can tell what it is by now. I would still recommend Dan Brown's books any day, despite the slight low ratings on Goodreads. I am aware that most readers claim that Brown has twisted reality to the most atrocious of levels. Thankfully, for a person with no clue about any of the topics he's ever written about so far, I have no problem with enjoying the book at all. But I'm sure that if Dan Brown were to write about something I was excellent at and passionate about - watching TV, Facebooking, sleeping - he'd be getting a thrashing from me as well.

NSA built a new code decipher TRANSLTR worth $2 billion but kept it as a secret. They recieved a code which was indecipherable even by TRANSLTR. The code was sent in by Ensei Tankado who was an ex-employee of NSA. He was thrown out of the organization because he always broke rules. Ensei believed in human rights of communication which TRANSLTR was violating as it could decipher any code. The program he wrote created an unbreakable code - the ultimate counterintelligence weapon. Ensei was found dead in Spain hence Becker was sent to Spain to get the copy of the pass-key, which was encrypted on his ring. He gave away the ring to a stranger before dying. To make things more complicated even tricked NSA by letting them snoop his emails, which led to a fake partner and a file. Strathmore, Susan's boss sent that file to the TRANSLTR to decipher. Strathmore's vision was a world encryption standard with a back door for the NSA, so that he could keep an eye of all sorts of communication happening around the world. Due to extensive heat TRANSLTR blew itself, killing Strathmore. TRANSLTR was linked with a database hence it was important to save it. At last, they found Ensei's clue in his video and saved the database from hackers.USA's obsession with keeping an eye on all sorts of communication in quite evident in this book, the reality of which not many know.

Originally, I started reading this last May but never got around to finishing it after I stopped at Chapter 20, and I must say that despite of the 5-month hiatus, I could still remember the details vividly. This was a wildly entertaining and the kind of info-dumpy book that I'm eager to read. The way Dan Brown paces the whole plot with (surprisingly!) digestible chapters really made the reading experience worth it. Digital Fortress is kind of a crash course to cryptography and etymology. This is highly educational and despite of the overwhelming cryptography details, I wasn't fazed at all. We follow two main POV's namely that of NSA head cryptographer Susan Fletcher and her fiance David Becker when they both embarked on separate courses in dismantling and understanding the enigmatic Digital Fortress. Next thing you know, you'll be getting an action packed trip in Seville, Spain and roam the ever elusive setup of NSA and the world of cryptography.

I also will admit I nearly didn\u2019t read this and nearly sent it back to the library so I could have more fantasy books.

There was a lot of research done for this book and I liked how the author managed to give us the techno descriptions of cryptography and the workings of technology\u2026without either boring us or being too over complicated that we lose the plot. Nope, everything was explained in an understandable and exciting way making the story for me, flow very fast. I should also mention that some of the one star reviews claimed that the information in this book was incorrect. I can\u2019t really say anything on this as I know practically nothing about cryptography and coding but I will say the author managed to make it all sound very real and correct.Another thing I liked was the development of the characters. Yep they were all very layered especially the bad guys. Wow, this author can definitely create interesting character backgrounds where not everyone\u2019s motifs are always clear. The only thing I didn\u2019t really like was the fact that the characters personalities weren\u2019t fully explored/developed. I just would have liked the characters to have more feelings and emotions about them but that\u2019s just me.So, this was my first Dan Brown book and I\u2019ll tell you this, it will not be my last!

It seems a universal truth that when you have run out of all of the books to read that you\u2019ve brought with you, it is impossible to find decent reading material wherever you are. Shamefully, I\u2019ve actually read most of his books. I read Angels and Demons because someone recommended it to me. Though I found his writing to be extraordinarily poor, I found the story to be engaging enough to overlook that fact. I didn\u2019t guess the ending, and it posited some fascinating ideas about history. I read The DaVinici Code because everyone was reading it and because I liked Angels and Demons. The DaVinici Code was written equally poorly, but I noticed a lot of similarities in the plots of the two novels. But it was still an entertaining read so I figured I\u2019d forgive it. Then, on my way to Costa Rica, I realized that I didn\u2019t bring enough books with me for the plan ride. I went to the bookstore in Charlotte, North Carolina and picked up Deception Point, yet another Dan Brown masterpiece. The plot of this book was \u201cThe DaVinci Code Goes Arctic\u201d.

A disgruntled NSA employee develops an unbreakable encryption program (the Digital Fortress) and threatens to give both the encryption program and the key (which is buried in the program) away on the Internet. If the bad guys gain access to the key, they will be able to communicate without fear of the NSA decrypting their messages.

David, on the other hand turns out to be the greatest daredevil of all time, outwitting a professional assassin, even though the most exciting thing he has done is to thrash an opponent on a squash court (and then treat him to a fruit shake and bagel). There\u2019s another character known only as Jabba \u2026 enough said?  Okay, so what\u2019s the bottom line?

The storyline takes place mainly in two separate locations: the top two members of the encryption team trying to break the program and track down the pass-key from headquarters and in Spain where the search is on for any possible physical pass-key possessed by the recently deceased creator of the program.This is a pretty fast-paced novel with lots of action on both fronts.

So I might be a little biased. (But who cares, right? Probably everyone, if you know what I mean)It starts with the main character, Susan, waking up to David getting a call. It's no ordinary call for him, but he doesn't want her to know that, so he just tells her \"it's just a work thing. I'll be back in a day.\" Which is understandable, considering what he'll go through next.Susan is dejected because her date was ruined, but then she gets a call from her commander. He's a hard-working poker-faced guy, but he has a soft spot for Susan because he doesn't want any hazing or harassment of her in their office at the NSA.He calls her, saying \"that she needs to come over IMMEDIATELY.\" She replies that \"she will be there soon\" and he replies \"how about sooner.\" Talk about irony. Anyway, she gets there, and she finds out why their billion-dollar code-breaking machine, TRANSLTR, has been trying to decode a code for at least 15 hours, which is way longer than their normal diagnostics.Susan and her commander, Strathmore, do a little bit of poking around and find out it is written by Ensei Tankando, who had actually died in Seville, Spain, earlier and was the reason why David left. Even more astonishing is that they find out that it's the first code that the NSA cannot break. The reason?Tankando actually worked at the NSA before and got so mad over the TRANSLTR machine that he threatened to leak it to the public. To tell them that the NSA had been spying on their emails. Now that was a bomb for the NSA. So to solve it Strathmore deported Tankando away. Which started Tankando's hatred of America ever since.Meanwhile, David is in Spain, trying to track down a mysterious ring in which it has the pass key engraved on it. It's basically like a scavenger hunt, with assassins on his tail, yet he survives and eventually makes it back to another date with Susan.I won't make the review any longer, but eventually, after a few deaths, they manage to regain control of Crypto and the NSA databank.

Dan Brown is a widely known author, who has written The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. This book is about a woman named Susan Fletcher, who works for the National Security Agency (NSA). After five years of work, the NSA invented the TRANSLTR, which could break any code known to man. TRANSLTR is faced with a code that it cannot break, and when the NSA calls it head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, she uncovers that the NSA is being held hostage by a code that could cripple the U.S. intelligence. Fletcher has to find out how to break the code, while her fianc\u00e9, David Becker, is in Seville, Spain to find the man who created this code and get the pass key to break the code.\tDigital Fortress was one of the most fascinating novels I have read.

As you finish each chapter, the reader is always \u201chungry for more.\u201d All the stories come together at the end, so you are not completely satisfied until the book is finished. Mystery books are without doubt my favorite books, but I love mystery with some kind of twist. Near the end when Fletcher is trying to break the code, Brown adds in a little science and history. He includes the isotopes of the element uranium and the system of codes that Julius Caesar used.\tYet there were a few things I thought about this book that could have been improved. Having four different stories going on and then combining them at the end is a great idea, but with the fine details Dan Brown puts into each sentence it can hard to understand everything. The other thing that was a little upsetting was the end. Finding the password that would kill the virus took a series of complicated steps, but the password ended up being the number 3. I would\u2019ve liked to see something a little more complex.\tEven though Digital Fortress had some bad points, it was an exciting novel that I enjoyed. Any reader who loves mysteries would love this book. Alone this book is enjoyable, but the science and the history that are mixed into the plot makes this book a techno-thriller. Even if you are not a mystery fan, it is guaranteed that this book would be fascinating to read.

His thriller, \"Digital Fortress\" has all of these elements, and it is an exhilarating novel that raises timely and thought-provoking questions. A covert agency, known as NSA (jokingly, \"No Such Agency\"), has a multi-billion dollar secret device known as TRANSLTR that can decrypt any code. It is used to eavesdrop on encrypted email communications worldwide; the data that it gathers prevents terrorists from carrying out planned attacks. However, if civilians were to find out that Uncle Sam is eavesdropping on them, they might not be too pleased. Ensei Tankado, a cryptographer who was dismissed by the NSA, hates everything that TRANSTR stands for. He believes that the government has gone too far in invading people's privacy. Tankado claims to have created an unbreakable algorithm, known as \"digital fortress,\" that even TRANSLTR cannot decipher. He threatens to release his algorithm unless the NSA publicly admits that it illegally gathers private information. If the general public were to learn Tankado's code, the government would lose its ability to read encrypted emails. Tankado's scheme goes awry, and what might have been merely a nuisance threatens to turn into a disaster. Brown makes the most of his subject. His descriptions of how cryptographers work and think are terrific, and I was fascinated by the mind-bending ciphers at the end of the novel. The protagonists, Susan Fletcher and David Becker, are nicely drawn, although a tad too superhuman. Susan is a brilliant cryptographer who works for the NSA, and David is an expert in linguistics. They both play a major role in trying to save the United States from an intelligence meltdown. \"Digital Fortress\" does have some weak points, including Brown's inability to write realistic romantic dialogue. However, when Brown sticks to sadistic assassins, wild chase scenes, and unlikely heroics, the story moves along at a breakneck pace. In addition, the author has some significant things to say about the conflict between an individual's right to privacy and the government's mission to do whatever it takes to safeguard its citizenry.", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["own"]}, {"book_id_title": "11125.Digital_Fortress", "book_id": "11125", "book_title": "Digital Fortress", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/69456431", "review_id": "69456431", "date": "Aug 30, 2009", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Benjamin Duffy", "user_url": "/user/show/602523-benjamin-duffy", "text": "If the roundly reviled The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons are examples of Dan Brown at his most polished, you can only imagine how bad he was during his early career.Actually, you can imagine, or you can read Digital Fortress and find out for yourself.

The impossible just takes longer.\"\n I can't. I can't even start to explain how mad, sad and confused I am right now. I am actually giving 1 star to a Dan Brown's book. 1 star. All I can think about is (and forgive me) WHAT THE FUCK?! What in hell is this?! A part of me still refuses to believe that this was written by him. A part of me wants to believe that this is some kind of joke. But it isn't. It isn't because Brown's writing style is unique and easy to identify and it certainly is here. It isn't because the freaking formula he uses all the time is here. The same formula I said over and over again that I didn't mind because I didn't come to his books looking for extreme originality, but looking for an enjoyable reading to entertain me for a while. The thing is I do mind the formula when I cannot enjoy the story, because it just makes the whole thing even more frustrating because I know what is going to happen next. And I couldn't enjoy this book. I simply couldn't. The book is just dull. Intolerably dull. I praised Brown so many times for being able to give me an action-packed, gripping plot since page one. This time all the action I got is during a mere ten chapters almost in the end of the book, after being bored to death after more than 400 pages. It is like he is putting here all the dullness he stole from his other books. And that's not okay. Especially when the first thing I read is that damn prologue that made me so sure it would be his typical action-packed plot. I HATE BEING WRONG. Especially in things like this. I feel like I was deceived and I hate the damn feeling. It could have got better, though. It only needed one of those breathtaking plot twists Dan Brown writes so well. But not even that I got this time! I don't get fooled by the same twist twice, Brown, I am sorry! You are free to use formula over and over again, as many times as you want. BUT DO NOT USE THE SAME PLOT TWIST TWICE! And damn it, if you want to use it don't make it so awfully obvious. I knew who the bad guy was even before I reach the 50% mark. In fact, forget the 50% mark. I knew it before I reach the 30% mark! That's not what I mean when I say I want to find the bad guy before the characters do! I don't want to read the whole story knowing who s/he is! It takes away any interest the book could have! But even if I knew who the bad guy was I still didn't know his/her motivations. So yes, the plot twist could have partially worked. His/her motivations were surprising, I expected him/her just to be bad, want money, want power, whatever. Which now that I am thinking is stupid, considering the character's description. But anyways, my point is they were surprising. Or could have been if only I was invested in the story. I wasn't. The characters could have all died for all I care. In fact, they should have died. There was a chance the story would have been shorter that way and my torture would have ended sooner.  Which only shows you how much I was able to connect with the characters. Zero. Which I don't think that is their fault, to be honest. Objectively talking, I guess I could say they were actually well-built. Unfortunatelly for them, that means nothing when I need to spend all my time reading trying to do not fall asleep. Bad things do not end here, though. One thing I admire about Dan Brown is his capacity to offer us information and \"fun facts\" about the theme he chooses for his books without making it overwhelming. That results in you actually learning something new while reading the books. That's not the case here. All the information is thrown at you at once, making it completly overwhelming and resulting in you learning nothing. So not even this can be considered a saving grace for this book. So what is the saving grace of this book? Honestly, I do not know. I couldn't acutally like anything about the book. Not the plot, not the twist, not the characters. Nothing! Overall, I am completly, utterly disappointed. I have never thought I would ever give one start to a Dan Brown's book. But then, I had never thought he would ever write a book this bad. I definitely do not recommed it and feel sorry for anyone who had met Dan Brown reading this book. Because I would think a hundred times before picking up any other of his books, which is a shame because some of them are actually pretty good.\n\"Force a hand and it will fight you.

And then more candy, maybe topped off with ice cream, cookies, cake? Some days that is okay. Until you get to about eight o'clock at night, and your body has reached a point that is beyond satiation. And then you think to yourself, just one last cookie. Your stomach is telling you don't do it. It's gurgling and protesting the hours of abuse it has already taken, but you keep thinking about how good that cookie is going to taste. So you do it. You eat it, and you find yourself regretting it almost immediately. You realize, in the end, that it didn't taste that good. In fact, you realized it was far too much, and you wish you could take it back because now, well now you have a full blown case of the stomach aches. And you completely regret your gluttonous behavior. That is what Digital Fortress feels like...gluttony for your brain. It was strangely addicting, completely entertaining, but had no substance whatsoever. And I think my brain is probably a little dumber for having read it. Maybe it was because I had just read Brown's Deception Point, and the last thing I needed to do was chase it with more mind numbing ridiculousness. Maybe it was because this is Brown's freshman go...his first novel. And I should give it one star. I know I should. But because it was entertaining, I had to give the guy some credit.However, when you set up a main character to be a genius...and I quote, \"His eyes fell the length of her sleder torso - to her white blouse with the bra barely visible beneath, to her knee-length khaki skirt, and finally to her legs...Susan Fletcher's legs. Hard to imagine they support a 170 IQ, he mused.\" I'm not going to parse the whole thing. I'm willing to accept that stock thrillers such as this are rife with hackneyed descriptions of people, in particular women, such as Brown's \"sexy\" depiction of Fletcher. I don't read these books because I'm expecting F. Scott Fitzgerald. I read them because they are entertaining, period. BUT...notice that Fletcher has an IQ of 170. 1.7.0!!! Is that even possible? I don't know.The point is that she's this genius decoder, right? Super smart and totally able to decode some of the most complicated cipher. And yet there are very extremely completely obvious \"ciphers\" right in front of her face that she does not get. Really? I'm no genius. But I got them right away. So I thought that really wasn't so great. And you are this completely smart and perfectly beautiful woman, and you know when all these various men are totally into you. But the crazy one, who is so obviously into you, you don't see? Even when it's in front of your face all the time? It reminded me too much of that one Patricia Cornwell novel with this one Kay Scarpetta character who is supposed to be a genius as well. But she does some really ill advised...STUPID...things. Um, not sure I understand how someone is a genius and then suddenly isn't a genius. So that was annoying.I also think Brown cleaned up his act when it comes to sex after this novel. This bordered on a Harelquin Romance extravaganza! The feminist in me screams out in protest at such garbage. I'm all for chemistry and attraction. But I revolt at silly depictions of the perfect woman and the perfect man falling in love. They are both just sooooooooo attractive and sooooooooo smart. And they have the most perfect jobs and perfect lives. Ugh! There wasn't anything really graphic. It just felt cliche and empty. And finally, the climax. It just went on and on and on. Oh dear me, just get to the point already. It was no longer exciting when all the brainiacs in the NSA couldn't solve the freaking mystery which was right in front of their faces! And the whole thing was going to blow up, and of course the perfect couple can save the day in the end. Because they are perfect and that is what they do!!! I just couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore, so there were some serious sighs. Some eye rolling. Some straight out laughs. It was far too melodramatic. Now to be fair to Brown, I have now read all of his books, and I've obviously enjoyed them, mostly. And I think now that he's written a few thrillers, that his writing has improved. He's no longer focused on sexual liasons between characters. And while his stories are completely unbelievable, they are also entertaining. The guy isn't proclaiming that he's the next Hemingway, after all. He's selling a product. I just think that from now on, I'll take my gluttony in smaller doses.

She discovers that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who was displeased with the NSA invading the privacy of peoples lives. Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm on his website and have his partner, \"NDAKOTA\", release it to the general public if he was to die.

Being a fan of Dan Browns works and having an interest in computers, I thought Digital Fortress would be the match for me. Although, I found that it did not live up the the expectations I thought it would uphold. Unlike 'Da Vinci Code', Digital Fortress' plot was very predictable and weak. I felt the characters were very underdeveloped, and that the story could have been so much better had Brown put more effort into character development. On the brightside, I found some parts to be very thrilling and on edge, and it was also very apparent that Brown put a lot of effort into researching computer code and algorithms.  I cannot say that I recommend this book to many people, but it was not a horrible book. People who are fans of Browns work will be slightly dissapointed, but will find it tolerable. People who are also interested in Computers and computer code will find the various references to algorithms and special codes very intriguing, but anyone who isn't very tech savvy will find it very confusing.

I think this was the third book of his I read, and really enjoyed it. It issome different from the Religious tact he takes on some of his other works. Good stuff. Before the multi-million runaway best-seller The DaVinci Code, Dan Brown set his sharp research and storytelling stills on the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA) in this novel - Digital Fortress. When the NSA's invincible code breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage not by guns or bombs-but by code so complex that if released would cripple U.S. intelligence. Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Digital Fortress is a techno-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 1998 by St. Martin's Press. The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible civil liberties and ethical implications of using such technology.Plot summaryWhen the United States National Security Agency's code-breaking supercomputer TRANSLTR encounters a revolutionary new code, Digital Fortress, that it cannot break, Commander Trevor Strathmore calls in head cryptographer Susan Fletcher to crack it. She discovers that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with the NSA's intrusion into people's private lives. If the NSA doesn't reveal TRANSLTR to the public, Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm on his website and have his partner, \"North Dakota,\" release it for free if he dies, essentially holding the NSA hostage. The agency is determined to stop Digital Fortress from becoming a threat to national security.When Tankado does indeed die in Seville, of what appears to be a heart attack, Strathmore asks David Becker (Susan's fianc\u00e9) to travel to Seville and recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is suspected to have the code that unlocks Digital Fortress. However, Becker soon discovers that Tankado gave the ring away just before his death. Each person he questions in the search for the ring is murdered by Hulohot, a mysterious deaf assassin.Meanwhile, telephone calls between North Dakota and Tokugen Numataka (chairman of the Japanese computer company Numatech) reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to gain access to the passcode on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. At the NSA, Fletcher's investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to bypass Gauntlet (NSA's virus/worm filter). However, Chartrukian is murdered after being pushed off the catwalk in the sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Chartrukian's fall also damages TRANSLTR's cooling system.Hale holds Fletcher and Strathmore hostage to prevent himself from being arrested for the murder. It is then that Hale explains that the e-mail he supposedly received from Tankado was actually in his inbox because he was snooping on Strathmore, who was also watching Tankado's e-mail account. After the encounter, Hale's name is cleared when Fletcher discovers through a tracer that North Dakota and Ensei Tankado are actually the same person, as \"NDAKOTA\" is an anagram of \"Tankado.\" Strathmore exposes himself when he fatally shoots Hale and arranges it to appear as a suicide. Susan later discovers through Strathmore's pager that he is the one who hired Hulohot. Becker later kills Hulohot in a violent confrontation.Chapters told from Strathmore's perspective reveal his motives. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring and at the same time arranging for Hulohot to kill him, he would facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor and enable him to unlock Digital Fortress. By making phone calls to Numataka posing as North Dakota, he thought he could partner with Numatech to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own backdoor Trojan so that the NSA could spy on every computer equipped with these chips. However, Strathmore was unaware that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm that, once unlocked would \"eat away\" at the NSA databank's security and allow \"any third-grader with a modem\" to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to the machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but soon after David Becker figures out the password (3, the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb, Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to the nuclear bombs that killed Tankado's mother and left him crippled), and is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka is Ensei Tankado's father. Numataka left Tankado the day he was born since Tankado was a deformed child.A very interesting book. It was a good one that Dan Brown started his career with.

I wasn't even expecting much, just a fun adventure mystery with cryptology and outdated nostalgic takes on technology and the NSA.

Like the cinematic creature for whom he was nicknamed, the man was a hairless spheroid.> \"How the hell are you?\" \"No complaints.\" Jabba wiped his mouth. \"You on site?\" \"Yup.\" \"Care to join me for a calzone?\" \"Love to Jabba, but I'm watching these hips.\" \"Really?\" He snickered. \"Mind if I join you?\" \"You're bad.\" \"You have no idea.\"> The motley assortment of drunken and drugged-out kids at the nearby tables were now in hysterics. Two-Tone stood up and sneered at Becker. \"What the fuck do you want from me?\" Becker thought a moment. I want you to wash your hair, clean up your language, and get a job. Becker figured it was too much to ask on a first meeting. \"I need some information,\" he said. \"Fuck you.\" \"I'm looking for someone.\" \"I ain't seen him.\" \"Haven't seen him,\" Becker corrected.> The air felt caustic in her windpipe.> Two thin lines had appeared outside the concentric circles. They looked like sperm trying to breach a reluctant egg.> Susan turned to Soshi. \"I need access to the Web. Is there a browser here?\" Soshi nodded. \"Netscape's sweetest.\" Susan grabbed her hand. \"Come on. We're going surfing.\"> Becker was dark--a rugged, youthful thirty-five with sharp green eyes and a wit to match. His strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan of carved marble. Over six feet tall, Becker moved across a squash court faster than any of his colleagues could comprehend. After soundly beating his opponent, he would cool off by dousing his head in a drinking fountain and soaking his tuft of thick, black hair.

It's always nice to see your country debased and portrayed as a hellhole. Which would be fine with me and even funny if it wasn't for the pedantic and preposterous insistence of Mr. Brown on making the main character super-cultured and super-aware of the Spanish culture. I get that the author only wanted an \"exotic\" setting for his written action movie and couldn't be bothered with the details, but I don't see the point in not informing yourself about the setting you're giving your novel but at the same time wanting your main character to know everything about said setting because he just HAS to be worldly and sophisticated. This contradiction gives as a result nonsensical situations such as my favorite scene in the novel, in which Becker recognizes a guy's accent as being from Burgos. I think people outside Burgos couldn't tell that accent apart if their life depended on it, but it's fine. Becker just can, which adds nothing to the plot except making the character look even more pedantic. Which is part of the second reason which made me dislike this mess of a book so much: the characters. Becker is like a creepy self-insertion fantasy of Brown, but not as creepy as Susan Fletcher. It seems Brown thinks (or thought at the time) feminism is about creating a super hot and hyper-sexualized female character with a perfect body, but to make her SMART in addition. The way he describes how other men look at her is nauseating, specially when he insists so much in her being a genius and just the best. But also hot. The fact that she is hot and that everybody is aware of it is apparently vital to the story. Well, in conclusion, I'm no Becker and I can't tell a person from Burgos apart, but I can say this book is rubbish (in my opinion). I get why some people like it, as it is full of action, but I still cringe when I think of it, and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. I'm no big fan of Dan Brown, but I think it's obvious he has come a long way since this book, and has improved a lot.

Thank you Dan Brown for creating a story featuring Susan Fletcher, a mathematician who is the head cryptographer at NSA. Security, secrecy and snooping is the name of the game at the NSA and this book is based on a real life incident. The NSA is trying to locate the passkey to an encryption program written by a disgruntled and dying employee that he intends to allow terrorists and ordinary criminals alike to have. This program will allow such people to create messages in code that cannot be broken by the NSA and prevent them from snooping. Susan and her fiance David race the clock to find the passkey only to discover that there are those who would kill rather than see them find it. I'd like to address some reviews of this book by people who say they know cryptography and that certain things don't exist. First of all, this is a NOVEL, a piece of FICTION. If you can't tolerate an author using his or her imagination in writing a novel, then maybe you should stick to nonfiction. Secondly, unless you work as head cryptographer for the NSA, you really don't know what secret technology they have that the public knows nothing about.

Let's try to capture the good bits first, which shouldn't take long. In some respects, Brown can clearly write, but that skillset seems to comprehend a really narrow window. Basically, he can write action. Bullets flying? Sure thing. Moped chase? Woohoo! Exploding supercomputers? Love it. In those few moments, his pace and descriptive abilities and general breathless sequence-hopping all works very nicely to create the sort of high-adrenaline jittery seat-of-your-pants ride that lots of writers really struggle with. The problem here, I think, is that Brown's fiction-writing toolbox is full to the brim of High Octane, and it contains very little else. Let's take the book apart in two pieces.Characters: Whilst I accept that we go to watch films starring unrealistically pretty actors, any aesthetic appreciation of them is really a passive experience, and we can vary in our opinions of just how attractive we really deem them to be. By contrast, we are told in no uncertain terms that the two main characters are impossibly attractive. Like, sparkling-teeth-with-every-dashing-smile attractive. They're also impossibly smart (Susan) and impossibly multilingual (Becker) and impossibly two-dimensional and irritating. They have great jobs and perfect bodies and lots of sex and oh no a tiny, vague cloud of discontent has formed on the horizon of their little perfect paradise and I haven't often wished both leading man *and* woman dead within the first few chapters but I was happy to make that concession this time.Becker's skills, incidentally, appear to extend not only to being proficient in around a dozen languages, but even being able to mimic, at will, various local dialects and accents adeptly enough to fool native speakers.Just\u2026 no.He is also so fragile that he can't let Susan pay for her own food like the functioning competent adult she is because\u2026 I don't know. Buying it for her makes some sort of non-point about his capacity to provide for her even though she's the big earner? It's probably the biggest mystery in the book since the rest of the plot is screamingly transparent. Anyway, Becker, the man who works for governments but hasn't heard of the NSA, the linguist who calls Kanji a language, the coed's university lecturer pinup with no security clearance, finds himself jetting off to Spain on a secret NSA code-finding mission. During the next forty-eight action-packed hours, he drinks, sprints, mopeds, and screams through a series of events that start out as extremely improbable and quickly escalate through several dimensions of nearly-impossible till the plot has reached a fever pitch of absurd surrealism. The final cherry on this cake is when, after not sleeping for two days, then being pepper-sprayed, chased across town, and repeatedly shot at, then almost falling to his death, and THEN being stun-gunned into unconsciousness, at the last second, having only been revived for a fe minutes and thousands of miles away, he OF COURSE has to be better at figuring out a classic crypto puzzle than Susan, the actual crypto genius, AND he has to have a clever one liner to throw in as well.Which takes me to our genius, Susan, you know, the genius with an IQ of 170 who turns out to be dumb as a fucking stick. Repeatedly. The ending of the whole thing as they're trying to \"unravel\" Tankado's \"clue\" is an agony of idiocy, if one can coin a collective noun for a non-count concept. She's the genius, and yet it seems that everyone but her is actually solving anything. What IS her purpose in this book, then, you ask? The same one as in all the other mindless shitty action pulps. She's a plot device. Susan needs no character, or skills, or motives, or personal goals, or interests, or indeed anything beyond the fact that she wears some shoes or other. She is a bland, empty husk with one purpose in this text - to provide motivation for all the gung-ho menfolk. Chad or Hale or whateverhisface wants to have lots of kinky time with Susan because she's hot. (Yawn.) Becker spends half his time thinking less about dodging bullets and more about how much he's not in a hotel room because, in case you missed it, she's hot. Strathmore tanks his marriage, career, life, and the entire NSA into the void because he's secretly madly in love with Susan. You know. The hot one. When Chad sees Strathmore kill someone, Susan becomes the pawn whose physical danger is Strathmore's only kryptonite. When the NSA Director sees her for the first time, his first through is how \"striking\" she is. It's all incredibly nauseating and dull. Aside from this role as plot device, running from first one threat and then from another, only figuring things out when they become impossible to ignore any longer, her only other parts in the book are to indulge in long internal monologues about how perfect her One True Love (Becker) is and to ineffectually run simple commands on the computer.Plot: Finally, the whole premise of the book is irritating. The pass-key idea is either some weird fictional liberty, or it's a monumental failure of research on Brown's part. I go for the latter since he didn't get the linguistics anywhere near right. And I can only imagine what actual NSA employees made of it. In amongst moments of reasonable action scenes there is a string of breathtaking idea that such simple manoeuvres - emailing oneself and successfully pretending to the NSA to be having a real conversation, faking phone calls, Susan not reading a To and From line in an email, Chad installing a keylogger in a keyboard, sending messages that openly state a list of murders compete with the victims' names, not switching the damned computer off and on again when it's about to blow up, Strathmore writing the most unbelievable suicide note in history AND SUSAN BELIEVING IT OMFG\u2026 it's like a collection of discount fiction devices strung together by numbers and published as a paperback.Anyway, this was all about as coherent as the book, so there we are.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["thriller", "on-shelf", "priority-medium"]}, {"book_id_title": "11125.Digital_Fortress", "book_id": "11125", "book_title": "Digital Fortress", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2373503572", "review_id": "2373503572", "date": "May 10, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Ankita Singh", "user_url": "/user/show/61924443-ankita-singh", "text": "What can I expect from Dan Brown than a page-turner masterpiece?

Susan wants DB to come over and have sex right now, but he can't because of a super-important mission that means he has to postpone their sexy getaway for a day. Oh, and the woman is an NSA cryptographer with a IQ of 170 and sexy legs, and she can't stop thinking about DB for more than a page. DB has an eidetic memory, (she reminisces while waiting for a door to open) speaks 'six Asian dialects' (actually naming any would be overkill), as well as Spanish, French and Italian, and his lectures are standing-room only. DB is 'dark' and 'rugged' and has sharp eyes and wit and is real good at sports and likes to drip water all over the place while ordering bagels. DB's also apparently a goddamn idiot, because (Susan continues to reminisce, in narrative, while this door opens) he's never heard of the NSA. You know, the largest US intelligence agency. Extremely famous. It's not like he does translation work for government agencies, there's no reason you should expect DB or his colleagues to know that sort of thing. He (a linguist with lots of experience with 'Asian dialects') also calls kanji a 'language', and is happy to provide translations of characters without context. Nonetheless, they paid him for some work, and he meets their boss on the way out the door with a fat cheque. Despite having just been in a room all day with lots of male codebreakers he couldn't understand, DB is fascinated to find that the female head of crypto is also hard for him to keep up with, though he manages to get a handle on that because she instantly falls in love with him. Yes, this is Susan, still narrating.  It went on like that for weeks. I'm only 10 pages in and I agree, this book has been sucking DB's dick for far too long. Also, holy infodump, Batman, there are a lot of errors in this book. Oh, finally, the goddamn door's open.Oh, hey, in case you were wondering, Dan Brown completely doesn't understand public-key encryption. It also seems like he's never sent or received an email, either, since he also thinks it's in widespread use protecting everyone's messages. Buy hey, what do I know, maybe Dan Brown has to type long encryption \"pass-key\"s (is this a mashup of 'key' and 'passphrase'?) every time someone sends him an email. So, we have a big secret universal codebreaking machine which is -- wait for it -- brute-forcing everything. I'll give due credit, this at least is an approach which would be applicable to a lot of ciphers, and just building faster hardware is indeed the sort of thing you could see an intelligence agency attempting. Though of course they seem to have built it with unicorn hair and leprechaun gold, given the key sizes they start throwing around later on. There was no such thing as an unbreakable code Oh dear. Susan seems terribly ill-informed for the head of cryptography at the NSA, which has produced one-time pads for decades. Does the concept of 'information-theoretically secure' not exist in this world?Oh god, the whole plot is going to be them working over this nonsense, isn't it? Yes, it's very important that we scan our ciphertext to make sure it's not a virus. Wouldn't want to have TRANSLTR execute a dangerous subroutine! Oh, look, it rejects encrypted messages that look 'unknown'. How the fuck do you write this stuff?Actually, it becomes a fairly ordinary thriller. There's ever more nonsense, a lot of which sounds like Brown misunderstanding and technobabble-enhancing things that really exist, such as Susan's tracer program written in a 'crossbreed' (?) programming language, or his conflation of the Skipjack block cipher with NSA-backdoored standards. The plot however really progresses through (a) DB running around Seville being a wiz with languages and (b) Susan having every male in the book lust after her, including a cut-and-paste jerk. For some reason the jerk is the one who defends things like basic civilian rights to privacy and judicial oversight, and our sympathetic Susan is the one who defends the NSA's right to do whatever it wants whenever it wants. That's right, the bad guys in this book are the people who don't want the NSA to have access to everyone's communications. Susan's boss is also madly in love with her, and tries to have DB assassinated for this reason. Yawn. There's really nothing to recommend in here. The technical core to the plot is all nonsense -- decryption shouldn't involve executing code from an external source, unbreakable ciphers have been known since WW2 -- and is littered with just enough real elements to make it clear that it's Brown misunderstanding things rather than ignoring them for the sake of a story. The self-insert nature of his character is blatant and slightly terrifying, and the treatment of the female characters is rather icky throughout. The writing is very simple, the dialogue dull. It's at least quick to get through, with chapters often only a couple of paragraphs long, but it would be even quicker to just never start.

Maybe it\u2019s because I love imagery and poetic descriptions but it seemed bland. The amount of times \u201cSusan looked doubtful\u201d and \u201cStrathmore nodded/shrugged\u201d in the first half of the book was ridiculous. Also, \u201cHis head was down, his sweaty head glistening in the light of his monitor\u201d - how did this get past editing? Aside from that, I hoped the short chapters would reflect the pace of the story and seem quick and snappy to keep the tension up, but instead it made the story drag on too much.Honestly, I didn\u2019t care for any of the characters except David (and Susan in the last half). They could have all dropped dead all of a sudden and I wouldn\u2019t have felt a thing. That doesn\u2019t seem too good for a novel that relies on emphasising how high the stakes are.Another thing that really bothered me: every woman in this book was portrayed as some sort of sensual goddess. There\u2019s nothing wrong with very intelligent women who are also extremely attractive, but the constant reminders were quite overbearing, especially in Susan\u2019s case because as far as I could tell there was hardly any proof of her cleverness; Susan was slower at figuring things out than I was, particularly in the first half, and this blind faith in Strathmore was insulting. If I was stuck somewhere with two guys and a dead body, I\u2019d be wary of trusting anyone, no matter how long I\u2019ve known them. And this wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that literally everyone was lusting after her. We get it, she\u2019s hot. Get over it. Anyway, even Midge was lowkey sexualised - again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a woman being sexually confident at 60 years old, but the overall portrayal across the whole book was just\u2026 annoying. I\u2019m pretty sure Megan was the only one who wasn\u2019t some sort of modern Aphrodite, but then again, she was only around 15/16.Strathmore\u2019s relationship with Susan was super gross. I would have been happy with it but I could sense that it would take a romantic turn, and I was right - his obsession with her and how possessive he was at times was just creepy, not to mention he wanted her fiancee killed off so he could snuggle up to her. Apart from that, it just made me uncomfortable for some reason, and hardly anything makes me uncomfortable.Okay, now that I\u2019ve been really picky, here are some positives: although I don\u2019t think it was executed exceptionally well, I liked the concept and plot of the story, and the whole cryptography thing was interesting. This might just be because I\u2019m not that into maths and technology but the writing does make you feel\u2026 less intelligent at times, which was great since the characters hardly made me feel academically inferior. Also, although I didn\u2019t trust Strathmore from the beginning, it was nice that I still kept second guessing myself with who the bad guy really was, and I liked how it turned out that none of the suspects were completely black or white.In general, I enjoyed it more once everything picked up in the second half or so of the book, which is why I considered giving it three stars, but ultimately I just didn\u2019t really feel anything while reading it, some of the things the characters said were obviously unnecessary except to slide in small plot twists, and the number of times I looked up and told myself \u201cthey\u2019re so stupid\u201d was way too high for this kind of story.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["mystery", "2016"]}, {"book_id_title": "11125.Digital_Fortress", "book_id": "11125", "book_title": "Digital Fortress", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1959921547", "review_id": "1959921547", "date": "Dec 22, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "AttWaq", "user_url": "/user/show/64084309-attwaq", "text": "AMAZING!!!It was like I was trying to crack the codes too, as they came in chapters.And, the ending was fantastic.The element code; I am so proud to say that I cracked it before the best hackers in the world could. \ud83d\ude03It was a really good book.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "11125.Digital_Fortress", "book_id": "11125", "book_title": "Digital Fortress", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3136164124", "review_id": "3136164124", "date": "Jan 13, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Jona Toto", "user_url": "/user/show/108487352-jona-toto", "text": "Dan Brown never disappoints!", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "11125.Digital_Fortress", "book_id": "11125", "book_title": "Digital Fortress", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2173706420", "review_id": "2173706420", "date": "Nov 04, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Debbie", "user_url": "/user/show/4191554-debbie", "text": "Typical Dan Brown....fast paced and characters woven into one another.

It wasn't exactly thriving with female characters or diversity or anything, but Sophie was honestly fine, and her grandmother (spoilers?) was damn cool. DAAAAMN COOL. Not to mention most of the plot was about *~*~the sacred feminine~*~*.So I took the L and thought, okay, Dan Brown is actually not one of those writers, that was an unfair assumption on my part. And then I pick up Digital Fortress.To be greeted by Susan Fletcher, who, somehow, despite being our MAIN PROTAGONIST, is also in solid Sexy Lamp Territory. We are told constantly that Susan is super intelligent, has an IQ of 180, is a genius at math and solving codes, a leader within the NSA. Do we actually see any of this? No, of course not!!!! Why should we establish any of the personality traits of our MAIN CHARACTER or let her actually DO ANYTHING? That would be\u2014like, a plot or something!!Instead, we get to watch Susan Fletcher cry, and get held hostage, and cry, and get held hostage again, as every single male character needs to comment either verbally or via internal dialogue about how sexy she is, how long her legs are, how her shirt reveals a bit of the top of her cleavage. We watch her fianc\u00e9 do absolutely everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) to actually brainstorm and resolve the conflict...for HER JOB in HER area of expertise. All Susan does is ask questions to men, who immediately correct her when she makes an inevitably wrong assumption about something (which is constantly).

WHAT?? NO PAYOFF???? ARE YOU FOR REAL, DAN BROWN? Why was she EVEN here? Also we find that at least 1/2 of the plot (where people get murdered) is simply because men can't help falling in love with Susan, and other women must concede to her superior beauty and intelligence. Honestly, at that point, it was just grotesque. (hide spoiler)]The idea behind this book had some promise, because internet surveillance is a bigger topic now than it's ever been. But the plot didn't ever get off the ground when it came to delivering on the interesting elements of its premise, but scuttled along with laborious action scenes and chase sequences, like instead of watching a low-budget action film in an hour and a half, you had chosen to read it for a week instead.

A former colleague of Susan and Trevor , Ensei Tankado had made an algorithm named Digital Fortress which was branded as unbreakable by the programmer but found dead in Spain .

Digital Fortress is biggleman's safe whose blueprints are kept secret and then locked in the same safe itself and can be opened by pass keys which are under the authority of Tankado . but events turned into a manner that Digital Fortress held NSA hostage whose existence would cripple the US Intelligence .

Beside plot , Dan Brown had portrayed the characters deeply . Susan Fletcher is drafted as a brilliant and beautiful mathematician holding key post in NSA and brainy enough with writing complex coding . She fell in love with David Becker who was a Professor in university and works part-time with NSA on some crucial stances . David is also portrayed as one of Trevor's aide and hence put on duty by trevor to travel to Spain to excavate Pass Key .

Brinkerhoff , Director NSA's & Midge , staff member of NSA's Director , are also bolted well . And here comes my favourite , Jabba who's brain behind NSA's digital world is portrayed as the most coolest guy in whole plot .

But I do have to say I have some complaints about it.At first, the writing of the book seemed so awkward to me I actually felt annoyed, but for the grace of the Goddess it got better along the way so I stayed strong and did not give up. Susan and David's romance fell flat to me, though. I literally couldn't care less about their relationship, to be honest. But what really annoyed me greatly was how Susan (and female characters in general - and I'm looking at you, Midge) was portrayed. She was the head of Crypto, we know, and she was beautiful, we also know. But when we saw the male characters' points of view it always went back to her beauty - and at them looking at her like she was food. (view spoiler)[I mean, by the end of the book Susan was a WRECK after spending all that time locked in Crypto with two gross ass men and the thing that striked the director the most when he met her for the first time, all soaked and tired, was her beauty. (hide spoiler)] Can we please have female characters in positions of power being intimidating because of their skills and intelligence and not because they're physically 'striking'? (view spoiler)[It was too gross to see Strathmore's obsession with her, but it was also awkward. It was disgusting, yes, but also treated poorly in the storyline. I couldn't feel that much disgust because of how ridiculous it felt. (hide spoiler)] Also, we saw a lot of David (mind you, a university teacher) in literal action in Spain, while Susan dealt with her tracer and trying to find out who North Dakota was, so when I got to the final stage of the book I was excited thinking it was finally time to see her doing her thing, code-breaking. Oh, how disappointed I was.

The ability to apply the halo effect on each character in the novel and how it can suddenly, without any intro change.The development of events, how each character was linked to the others, and how parts of the puzzle are pulled smoothly to form the complete picture was amazing. Maybe the ending can be a little bit predictable because oftenly good wins at the end. But the method to reach this end was outstanding and yet difficult for anyone to expect. The challenges that the characters face and the sudden change in the route of events make no room for expectations and you can find yourself in a complete new story than how you have started.The ability of Dan Brown to make characters in different places move at the same time, and you as reader can visualise all characters making actions, you are reading about those in the NSA and yet can't forget those who are running in Seville, Spain, or those who are waiting for a word in Japan.The novel is irresistible.

Dan Brown has written a thriller for those of us who like our hardware with disc drives and who rate our heroes by big brainpower rather than big firepower. It's an Internet user's spy novel where the good guys and bad guys struggle over secrets somewhat more intellectual than just where the secret formula is hidden--they have to gain understanding of what the secret formula actually is.In this case, the secret formula is a new means of encryption, capable of changing the balance of international power. Part of the fun is that the book takes the reader along into an understanding of encryption technologies. You'll find yourself better understanding the political battles over such real-life technologies as the Clipper Chip and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software even though the book looks at the issues through the eyes of fiction.Although there's enough globehopping in this book for James Bond, the real battleground is cyberspace, because that's where the \"bomb\" (or rather, the new encryption algorithm) will explode. Yes, there are a few flaws in the plot if you look too closely, but the cleverness and the sheer fun of it all more than make up for them. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and a lot of high, gee-whiz-level information about encryption, code breaking, and the role they play in international politics.

I mean, I don't expect writers to actually get computer science right in their novels any more than I expect them to get any science right. And liberties can be taken to make things more cinematic (as is done in a painfully obvious way here). So the fact that every aspect of this book's understanding of not just cryptography, but basics like \"how email works\" didn't bother me much.Well, check that. It bothered in some places where the issue was less understanding of computers and more doing simple math in your head. Like with your $2 billion super-computer taking on average 6 minutes to decrypt an email\u2014this is a plot point\u2014but also decrypting email serially (one after the other, instead of many emails at once) also being a plot point. Six minutes is a great number because it goes evenly into 60 minutes. You can decrypt an average 10 emails an hour, or 240/day.Good thing the whole world didn't send more than 240 emails a day back in 1998. This is confirmed by one character actually saying \"237 codes broken yesterday\". But then, the icing on the dumb cake, the cost for those 6 minutes is said to be $874. The \"digital fortress\" code is then said to cost $1,000,000,000 for 18 hours. Well, without even doing the math you can see that that's not even the right ball park. If running TRANSLTR (the decrypting computer) costs $874 * 240/day, we are many zeroes short of it being possible to cost a billion a day. That's closer to $200K/day maximum, so we're actually FOUR zeroes away from a billion.It's easier to set aside the dumb when it's stuff you could understand people believing, but harder (at least for me) when it's just laziness. And much, much harder when the dumb extends to every level of the book.It's a matrushka of dumb:That's not how computers work.That's not how email works.That's not how encryption works.That's not how the NSA works.That's not how airports work.That's not how silencers work.That's not how gunshot wounds work.That's not how BICEPS work.At one point, our \"hero\" (there is no main character in this book, but let's assume the Dan Brown stand-in Dave Becker is him) hangs from a ledge, and we're told what a good thing it is that Dave worked on his biceps to improve his squash serve, because that makes things like hanging from ledges and doing pull-ups easy (except that it turns out not to be, perhaps due to his intermittent suffering from a gunshot wound).Except, of course, the primary muscle group you'd use for both activities would be the delts. Biceps are minimally helpful in doing pull-ups.At some point, the factual errors seem to border on the perverse. Like, is he just punking us? (Don't get me started on the Seville bus line that ONLY goes to the punk club, which is the exact place DB needs to go.) Does he think it's cute to say that Christopher Columbus is a saint (he's not) and that his scrotum is a prized relic in Seville (it's not)? I guess this is all foreshadowing for the colossal ignorance of The Da Vinci Code, but could he at least not say \"Damn Spaniards do communion first\"\u2014an unneeded and untrue point of faux-suspense?I'm harping on this stuff because it's lazy, but it's lazy in service to other lazy things. We got our hot'n'sexy codebreaker, who isn't just a pair of legs that gets ogled but a 170 IQ crypto-genius who DB uses as the stand-in for the audience (whom he must believe to be very dumb). She's constantly shocked at things a child would grasp immediately. She fails to unscramble a puzzle on the level of Junior Jumble\u2014though in fairness the whole NSA does this. This is an example of another sort of laziness: A character is described one way, and then because the plot requires it, acts or is treated completely opposed to that. One character is described as having an uncanny intuition about things, literally never being wrong. But if they pay attention to her, the story ends so they ignore her until it's too late. Then there's the whole over-arching philosophy of \"Well, of COURSE the NSA should be able to spy on EVERYONE.\" All the heroes believe this. Only villains and nuts at the EFF believe in privacy.Oy. Well, DB went on to great fame and fortune and blessedly few books, so all the rantings of an Internet troll like myself don't amount to a hill of beans.

For example, I will add things that I found out about from this particular book:\"Caesar, she explained, was the first code-writer in history. When his foot-messengers started getting ambushed and his secret communiqu\u00e9s stolen, he devised a rudimentary way to encrypt his directives. He rearranged the text of his messages such that the correspondence looked senseless. Of course, it was not. Each message always had a letter-count that was a perfect square\u2014sixteen, twenty-five, one hundred\u2014depending on how much Caesar needed to say. He secretly informed his officers that when a random message arrived, they should transcribe the text into a square grid. If they did, and read top to-bottom, a secret message would magically appear.\"\"Over time Caesar\u2019s concept of rearranging text was adopted by others and modified to become more difficult to break. The pinnacle of non computer-based encryption came during World War II. The Nazis built a baffling encryption machine named Enigma. The device resembled an old-fashioned typewriter with brass interlocking rotors that revolved in intricate ways and shuffled clear text into confounding arrays of seemingly senseless character groupings. Only by having another Enigma machine, calibrated the exact same way, could the recipient break the code.\"\"Susan had always thought the term \u201cbug\u201d had an amusing origin: It came from the world\u2019s first computer\u2014the Mark 1\u2014a room-size maze of electromechanical circuits built in 1944 in a lab at Harvard University. The computer developed a glitch one day, and no one was able to locate the cause. After hours of searching, a lab assistant finally spotted the problem. It seemed a moth had landed on one of the computer\u2019s circuit boards and shorted it out. From that moment on, computer glitches were referred to as bugs.\"\"During the Renaissance, Spanish sculptors who made mistakes while carving expensive marble often patched their flaws with cera\u2014\u201cwax.\u201d A statue that had no flaws and required no patching was hailed as a \u201csculpture sincera\u201d or a \u201csculpture without wax.\u201d The phrase eventually came to mean anything honest or true.

Why still three stars? Well, i liked the idea of unbreakable code, and only that kept me turning pages when the characters were being sexist and misogynous.

I don't know if these are meant for men and the sexist shit the women are forced to suffer is thought entertaining, but i sure as hell was not.Let me introduce you our main character, Susan Fletcher. Susan is super intelligent, Susan is NSA's head cryptographer. Susan is apparently also world's sexiest woman, since there is no man in the office who isn't fantasizing about her, following her with their eyes, wanting to fuck her against the super computer (oh yes) or actively trying to kill her husband so that they can offer a comforting shoulder for her and thus get her unconditional love. Oh and the one doing the last bit is her boss.Susan gets nasty suggestions and unwanted flirting from her (all-male) co-workers apparently daily, and is almost-harassed in this book two times.

This book is about national security, cryptography and security (apparently), apart from the general ingredients of a classic, like murder, chase thrills, politics, betreyal, etc. A few things I liked about the book were the plot twists (not as good as DVC), the shift of scenes from US to Spain and vice versa, and the parts where details are divulged using thoughts, between dialogues and lastly, the descriptiveness of the scenes, as Brown tries to make us feel the impact and grandiosity of the setting, better reflected by none other than the scene where TRANSLTR blows up:\nA fireball racing upward through three million silicon chips makes a unique sound. The crackling of a forest fire, the howling of a tornado, the steaming gush of a geyser... all trapped within a reverberant hull. It was the devil's breath, pouring through a sealed cavern, looking for escape. Strathmore knelt transfixed by the horrific noise rising toward them. The world's most expensive computer was about to become an eight-story inferno.\nTalking about the negatives, the character development wasn't great. Even though a thriller might not give as much scope for character development, I felt there were too many characters, just filling chapters, and some interesting ones like Tankado, Fontaine, Hulohot and Midge weren't developed (and Numataka suddenly disappears in between and resurfaces in the epilogue. True that he doesn't have a role according to the storyline, but the narration should have taken care of that I felt, or maybe I am expecting too much and forgetting that it's a debut novel). Brown seems to have misjudged a bit, the characters who make for interesting reading. Lastly, once Strathmore dies, the novel loses its edge, as the onus suddenly shifts from the TRANSLTR to the Databank. And the last few chapters after the clue is decoded seems to have been long drawn out, as stated in a review, since the code seems to have been clear enough to be comprehended by anyone who knows basic chemistry and a bit of history out there, let alone a team of experts.

Anyways, getting to the point: The supercomputer TRANSLTR which can instantly decode any encrypted message allowing the NSA to stop numerous terrorist threats, TRANSLTR that can decode almost any message sent and intercepted anywhere in the world over the Internet, meets an unbreakable code created by Ensei Tankado, a cryptographer who had threatened to make it available for public use if the NSA didn\u2019t make TRANSLTR\u2019s existence known to the general public.And that's when the agency commander Strathmore calls for the NSA's top cryptographer Susan Fletcher, a beautiful and brilliant mathematical genius.

Although if you have seen enough movies like me (I just simply LOVE movies), you would probably guess the villain form the first three chapters only, which may lessen the interest, but the chapters on David Becker are packed with intense action scenes and gully chases, which make up more than required.While heading towards the climax, you would actually forget to breathe, and read on your toes, because of that jittery feeling you get when something really bad is happening and you have to prevent it in like a second,You may feel that Dan's stretching a book a bit, but that's what's \"building the suspense\" is.

The characters are extremely basic and conventional. Not once did I consider them carefully created, especially the everyday man, David Becker. The whole concept was interesting at first, but grew frustratingly moronic as logic stretched thin. The book lacks true character depth and for a book this bloated, it was crazy how little I cared for them. Storylines are built surrounding a solid concept and I will admit, Digital Fortress has one. The issue here is the forced plotline and twists. Some you will see a mile away, like the true villain. In the end I was hoping Becker would get the bullet, his arc is really not interesting. I think a book based in the Crypto itself was a better option, and that's the film version you want to see. This grows tiresome as plausibility and logic is thrown to the wind.
