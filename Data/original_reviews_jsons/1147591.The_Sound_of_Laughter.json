I did find it a page-turner, and it's certainly different from many books out there ;)For those who don't know who the Hell Peter Kay is; he's a Northern English (Bolton, Lancashire) comedian ;)It basically covers how he started off in work, gained material from funny (kind of) things that happenned to him, then went into stand up comedy. Followed by a couple of television shows and commercials... Is it funny? Some parts may make you smile (depending on your sense of humour, he's not funny to everyone, and not all the time), but I didn't find it a 'laugh out loud' read... Example: In one of his places of work, he rounds a corner with a work friend and finds armed masked robbers and staff on the ground. One guy, in a Mickey Mouse or Colonel Ghadafi mask points a sawn-off shotgun at him and tells him \"Get Down!\" Peter Kay replies \"What, you mean dance?\" *Laughing*Okay, maybe some parts are actually 'laugh out loud' funny ;)The thing that struck me as a little odd, or maybe just not healthy, I'm not sure; Was how much he relied on his mother (I'm not saying that's a bad thing, or maybe I am *smiling*)... I mean like cooking his meals when he's an adult (daily, not occassionally), though he was obviously very close to his mother (and I certainly don't object to that)... At one point he leaves home to go to college, he packs his clothes and duvet and goes to catch a train. Okay, so far this isn't weird ;) But then, after one day (or something close) he decides it's not for him and he phones his mother... He says that college is okay, then asks what she's having for dinner... Then, as he's actually in a phone booth at the end of the street, he rushes down and knocks on his mother's door (then goes in for his dinner)... Maybe it's just me... I do understand showing your mother that you love her. I understand spending time with her... But I was cooking my own meals when I was 14 years old, doing my own washing and shopping (and my mother's shopping)... Okay, that may not be 'normal' either LMFAO... But I also left home at 18, so maybe it's just me... It's certainly my opinion ;)I enjoyed reading it the first time, but I wouldn't want to read it again.

All of their memoirs showed a frank, warts and all glimpse into their lives and were a lot more humorous as a result as well. With The sound of laughter, I felt I could have written it myself with enough research and feel I know Peter Kay less than I did from my preconceptions before reading it. All the 'funny anecdotes' were things I had seen dozens of times before. He even described how he does a wedding sketch where he's a kid at a wedding sliding on his knees. Who hasn't seen that? He describes much of the things we have all seen before and made me feel I was now more than familiar with his entire repertoire. This isn't entirely Peter's fault. It is just that he seems to have been extremely lucky in his road to success and we are all aware of all of it. There isn't really a back story.

To be honest I didn\u2019t read it back then, even though I love Peter Kay. Autobiographies in my opinion should be written towards the end of the subjects long and illustrious career, or at least in the autumn of it, once they have a story to tell. However it then came out on Audible read by Peter Kay. It was a no brainer, I had to listen to it. I may be 15 years late in discovering this book, but the wait was worth it and although I thoroughly enjoyed the content Peter Kay\u2019s reading off it enhanced it 200%!What I loved about this was the way he reads it, it\u2019s not just a straight forward narration, you get the feeling he\u2019s sat there, book in hand reading just to you, constantly breaking off with comments, comic asides and the occasional brew. He mentions in his book that audio books can sometimes be boring and put you to sleep half way through the first chapter, that\u2019s a criticism that can\u2019t be applied in this case! This reading style fits perfectly with Peter Kay\u2019s persona and it makes for a very entertaining, enjoyable and funny listen. As for my criticism of autobiographies published too early in someone\u2019s career, well The Sound of Laughter only covers Peter Kay\u2019s life up to him breaking through as a stand up comedian. There\u2019s nothing about his successes such as Pheonix Night\u2019s, Car Share or his uproariously funny stand up tours. So there is room for another volume - maybe at the end of his long and illustrious career! What you do get here amongst the jokes and laughter is a story of someone who worked hard to get where he is. Having had several part time jobs along the way. I think for me what sums him up is the fact it took him 5 tests and 6 years to pass his driving test, he never gave up.I would thoroughly recommend the Audible version of The Sound of Laughter if like me you didn\u2019t read the book or if even if you did, either way it\u2019ll brighten up your day and put a smile on your face.

This covers his school life, life following school, uni, various college courses and dozens of jobs. However good luck working out which order all of that goes in.

I listened to this on audible so it was Peter reading it, and he has put in some extra bits where he will just stop the book and talk for half an hour. Except he talks about nothing (sorry). With his chaotic form of recounting events and his rambling in between I very nearly gave up on the book. But I decided after a weeks rest to give it another go. Glad I did, as this was the part where he tells his little anecdotes about the various jobs he\u2019s had. I loved listening to his stories. I loved hearing how close he was to his family, how he loved being at home, his favourite tea of chicken Kiev, chips, beans and a fried egg (must try that). It all made it very Peter Kay. Suddenly I was really enjoying the book, and it picked up a lot. The lack of chronology still bothered me but when i heard how he started his stand up acts it made sense, it\u2019s his style.

I remember reading some sort of ballpark figure in The Bookseller that Christmas or following New Year in the regions of one in three households in the North West had received a copy and that at least 80% had been from that surrounding area. That alone is a huge achievement and testament to Peter\u2019s warm and infectious style (one that can only come from up north), not to mention the success he has achieved from his other endeavours within the media. He has also the attribute of having a similar effect to the sales of DVDs. Peter (on the other hand), could quite well become the Alan Bennett for the next generation if his first book is anything to go by. The book isn\u2019t massively well written but has a definite grasp on the current nostalgia/anecdote market trend. In many ways, he is a hark back to the days of light entertainment and the likes of Freddie Starr and reading a lot of this book did make me want to take Freddie to one side and say, \u201cHere Freddie, that thing you complained about the direction TV has gone and away from people like you\u2026\u201d \u2026because Peter is the embodiment of light entertainment, Freddie. He is just funny and inoffensive. Unlike you. Peter\u2019s book is a joy though. He has this great style that is beyond the genre and I think his secret to book success is how he has really took to writing out of the box with his narrative, in that he doesn\u2019t just tell you the story, he takes you along the writing process and ribs the idea of himself going down the book route. His love for his culture and indeed it\u2019s nostalgia is also quite endearing. The mention of things, products, places, TV shows of yesteryear makes you chuckle and turn the page and the fact that you do realise that this is not really a celebrity at all (or not one that embraces the culture of) is quite significant and evidence of his appeal.

The bathroom) where I took up residency for quite some time!) Kay is British but his childhood was quite similar to my Irish Catholic one and he is of the same vintage. I laughed aloud at his description of the 'good room' mentality. For those not in the know the 'good room' was a forbidden zone for many children of a certain generation. (1970's to 1990).Kay came from a Coronation Street type home -- a small two up two down house. Yet his mother still insisted on keeping one room for guests. The 'good room' was strictly off limits unless someone turned up. So basically, you had this ridiculous situation of not being allowed in to one room unless an outsider came in. Crammed in like sardines unless a visitor called. The book is laugh out loud funny. His description of the awful jobs he took before he hit the big time are hilarious. His attempts to learn how to drive, the characters he met in his menial jobs -- the book is a real treat if you need a quick 'pick me up' after a stressful work week.
