In summer that is a usual lunch in my house. (& why, oh why, do I seem to be the only person in the world who loves beefsteak tomatoes? Even Jamie has a wee dig at them! They make a great sandwich base!)On my second flick through I found fantastic fish pie I decided it would work with our local cheap but usually tasteless hoki fish - & it did! The hoki was very fresh & the hot mustard added a bit of bite, the nutmeg some sweetness. My husband (& I'm starting to realise he is turning into one picky eater!) doesn't normally like hoki but he said he would be happy to eat this dish every week! Inspired & encouraged I made a couple of the sides last night. The baked beetroot was an absolute unqualified success & I will now make it again & again. I really liked the steamed spinach with coconut rice - but that was a lot of calories for a mild (but delicious) result. That one might be a one off.This early Oliver work doesn't have so many of the vanity photos that drive me \ncrazy\n in some of his later works. & he looks so ridiculously, endearingly young in this book (he gives his age as 24, but he looks waaay younger than that!)If you can pick this book up secondhand or from your local library, I would recommend taking a look.

I enjoyed bread and pizza chapter (perhaps because I have always made it like that (thanks, mom)), veg as well, though I thought that is it a little to short, would have loved it, if there would be a bit more stress on it. And funnily enough I liked the fish chapter (although I do not eat fish and the fishes in the pictures looked a bit sad) I have always improvised when I had to cook fish and seems that I have done the right thing.
