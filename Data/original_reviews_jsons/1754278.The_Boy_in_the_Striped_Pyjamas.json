Do I start with the 9-year-old boy and his 12-year-old sister, who read about 6 and 8, respectively? The imperial measurements (miles, feet) despite the German setting? The German boy, raised in Berlin, who thinks that Der F\u00fchrer is \"The Fury\" and Auschwitz is \"Out-With,\" despite being corrected several times and seeing it written down? The other English-language idioms and mis-hearings, despite our being told that he speaks only German? And that he believes that \"Heil Hitler!\" is a fancy word for hello, because he understands neither \"Heil\" nor \"Hitler\"?So maybe these are fussy issues, and I shouldn't trash the book on these minor linguistic flaws. Instead, I can start with the plot holes big enough to drive a truck through: that Bruno, whose father is a high-ranking official in \"The Fury\"'s regime, doesn't know what a Jew is, or that he's living next door to a concentration camp. Or that the people wearing the \"striped pajamas\" are being killed, and THAT's why they don't get up after the soldiers stand close to them and there are sounds \"like gunshots.\" Or that there's a section of fence that is (a) unpatrolled and (b) can be lifted from the ground high enough to pass food and, eventually, a small boy through, AND that nobody would try to get OUT through this hole. Or that Bruno's friend Shmuel, a frail 9-year-old boy, would survive over a year in a Nazi camp. Or even the author's refusal to ever use the word \"Auschwitz,\" in an effort to \"make this book about any camp, to add a universality to Bruno's experience.\"That last is from an interview with the author that appears at the end of the audio version. I can't speak to most of what he said, because it was a lot of \"here are all the places that are hyping my book,\" but the worst part of it, to me, was where he was addressing criticisms: \"there are people who complain that Bruno is too innocent, too naive, and they are trivializing the message of this book.\" Um, no. I'm not trivializing the message; I'm objecting to his trivializing of the Holocaust. I find his treatment of the Holocaust to be superficial, misleading, and even offensive.As an audio recording, I'm pretty neutral. The narrator did the best he could with the material and there was some differentiation between the characters' voices, but the music that was added... some chapters ended with appropriately-somber music. Other chapters had no music at all. Sometimes the music appeared in the middle of a chapter. Two other incidental notes: first, normally you can't say anything negative about a Holocaust-themed book without being an asshole, because the books are so tied in with the Holocaust itself. In this case, though, I feel like, due to the fictionalizing of it, the book is far enough removed from Auschwitz that it's okay to be negative about the book without being insensitive about the Holocaust. Second, this doesn't land on my \"run away! Save yourself!\" shelf, because that's more for books that are comically bad--books that I can bash with glee and mock with abandon. I can't find anything funny about what makes this book so bad; it's just plain offensive and shallow.

This book is so ignorant of historical facts about concentration camps that it kicks the history of the Holocaust right in the teeth.John Boyne's premise is that the nine-year old son of the commandant of Auschwitz, bored with his isolated life, takes walks to the fence surrounding this infamous camp and meets there a nine-year old inmate who is on the other side of the fence. The two boys become friends and continue meeting on a daily basis. Here is some news for Mr. Boyne. The 10-ft high barbed wire fence surrounding each camp was electrified. Touch if once and you are fried. There was a no-man's land on each side of the fence; along the inside perimeter of the fence were guard towers; each tower was manned by an armed guard around the clock; each guard was responsible for one segment of the fence within his vision; it was his duty to prevent anyone from approaching the fence, either from the inside, or from the outside; he was under orders to shoot anyone he saw approaching the no-man's-land.In addition, along the outside perimeter, prominent signs proclaimed, \"STOP - Danger - High-Voltage Electricity.\" So that even a dense nine-year-old would get the message, a skull and cross-bones were pictured at the top of each sign. Let me add this. A nine-year-old boy arriving in Auschwitz-Birkenau on a cattle train would take only a single walk in this camp: from the train to the gas chamber.\"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas\" makes a mockery of these very basic facts. It is a fantasy that does untold damage to the cause of truth about the Holocaust. This book has only one purpose: to make a lot of money for the author and the publisher. And this purpose it accomplishes. The publisher recently proudly trumpeted in an ad in the New York Times: over one-million copies sold and still going strong.

Let's open with some descriptive words that sum up this book, and I will then go on to explain them in further detail: Patronizing. Insipid. Smarmy. Just plain bad. Patronizing: I believe that to write good children's literature, you have to think that children are intelligent, capable human beings who are worth writing for - like Stephen King, who probably thinks kids are smarter than adults. The author of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, on the other hand, clearly thinks that children are idiots. The main character, Bruno, is supposed to be nine years old, but compared to him Danny Torrance of The Shining (who was six) looks like a Mensa member. There's childlike naivety, and then there's Bruno, who is so stunningly unobservant and unperceptive that I actually started to wonder if he was supposed to be mentally deficient somehow. And he's not the only child who receives Boyne's withering scorn and condescension. Take this scene between Bruno and his sister Gretel, when they've just moved to their house at \"Out-With\" (as Bruno insists on calling it, despite being corrected many times and seeing the name written down) and are wondering how long they're going to stay there. Bruno's father, a commandant in charge of the camp, has told the kids that they'll be there \"for the foreseeable future\" and Bruno doesn't know what that means. \"'It means weeks from now,' Gretel said with an intelligent nod of her head. 'Perhaps as long as three.'\" Gretel is twelve years old, by the way. TWELVE. See what I meant about Boyne thinking kids are morons? Insipid And Smarmy: this book was not meant for kids to read. It's meant for adults who know about the Holocaust already, so they can read it and sigh over the precious innocent widdle children's adorable misunderstanding of the horrible events surrounding them and how they still remain innocent and uuuuuuggggggghhhhh. There's a scene towards the end, where Bruno puts on a pair of the \"striped pajamas\" so he can visit his friend on the other side of the fence. Bruno has had lice, so his head is shaved. When he puts on the pajamas, the Jewish boy observes him and the narration commits the following Hallmark-worthy atrocity: \"If it wasn't for the fact that Bruno was nowhere near as skinny as the boys on his side of the fence, and not quite so pale either, it would have been difficult to tell them apart. It was almost (Shmuel thought) as if they were all exactly the same really.\" YES JOHN BOYNE I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE. Just Plain Bad: This book is, technically, historic fiction, but I'm not putting it on my history shelf, because there is nothing historical in this book. Bruno is supposed to have grown up in Nazi Germany, the son of a high ranking SS officer, but based on his knowledge of everything, he's spent his entire nine years sitting inside with his eyes shut humming loudly while covering his ears. Okay, I get that he wouldn't know about the concentration camps - hardly anyone did at that point. But there are other things: Bruno consistently (and adorably!) mispronounces the Fuhrer as \"the Fury\" (I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE JOHN BOYNE), and doesn't recognize the following key words and phrases: Jews, Fatherland, Heil Hitler. What. The fuck. Okay, so maybe this kid's too young to be in Hitler Youth (his sister isn't though, but for some reason she's not in it either), but come on - he thinks \"Heil Hitler\" is just a polite way to end a conversation. A nine-year-old boy growing up in a military household in Nazi Germany doesn't know what Heil Hitler means.All of this comes back to my original thesis: John Boyne thinks that children are idiots. Look, Boyne: just because you don't understand anything (history, children, good writing) doesn't mean the rest of us are quite so useless.

It won't fill your thoughts for many days or shock you; rather it will fill your LIFE and make you feel sick to the core of your being.Paul Friedlander, himself a survivor, recounts in his recent highly praised book the incident of 90 Jewish infants all under the age of five, orphaned after their parents were murdered in a mass shooting.These children were subjected to indescribable mistreatment for days.Then they were individually hanged.I read this with horror, revulsion and total disbelief.(ref.The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939 - 1945)Or the incident of the young German soldier participating in the evacuation of the patients in the hospital in the Warsaw Ghetto. In the presence of a distraught Jewish crowd of relatives and onlookers, patients were being thrown onto the backs of trucks.The babies were being thrown from the upper windows. The soldier requested and was given permission to catch the falling babies on his bayonet.(ref. The Holocaust - the Jewish Tragedy by Martin Gilbert.ISBN 0 00 637194 9 )There are so many historical inaccuracies and ludicrous details in this totally implausible story of Boyne's eg. Bruno's ignorance of basics, impossible when he would have been in the Hitler Youth and the Nazi education system.This travesty of the Holocaust is called a 'fable' as if with all its faults, it has special claim on some gravitas, thus giving Boyne justification for this lame expose of racism.I was a member of the Jewish Holocaust Committee here in Sydney for a while and once had to endure a young rabbi lecturing on how the Holocaust was God's punishment on the Jews. So there are fools to be found inside the club as well as outside it.Not a single pure ethnic German child entered a gas chamber as part of the extermination of the Jews...although many died in Germany as part of thepre-war killing of disabled and retarded children.When protests brought this program to a close the same staff were later sent to operate the gas chambers in the camps.And for six million Jewish men, women and children there was no saviour. This bitter pill is too much for some people to swallow.Some, like the young rabbi, takes refuge in blaming the very victims;others find refuge in sentimental fiction such as Boyne's which does no honour to these tragic, lost people. And today there are perverse forces abroad, from renowned historians to Catholic bishops, who would deny that the Holocaust ever took place or to an extraordinary lesser degree.They use every discrepancy of detail as well as lies to justify their denial. So for anyone touching on this subject it is vital and morally incumbent on them to GET THE FACTS RIGHT.There is an overwhelming library of rivetting, emotional, inspiring and tragic Holocaust stories out there - all factual, which you may have already plunged into. Boyne may even have led you there. But finally Boyne just deserves to fade away.P.S.The Oscar winning Foreign Language film of 1997, \"Life is Beautiful\", was also, not surprisingly, referred to as a 'fable'. It also is an implausible piece of Holocaust sentimentality and a stampede away from having to swallow the bitter pill of reality.

They are wealthy and his father is an important soldier who is promoted to be the Commandant at Auschwitz. The trick of the story is that Bruno doesn't realise the horror of what goes on behind the barbed wire, where everyone wears striped pyjamas, even when he befriends a boy of the same age at a corner of the camp. Although his father can be strict and distant, Bruno is unfailing in his trust in the goodness of his father. In the film, there was at least a gradual, if reluctant, dawning of doubt about his father and all he stood for, but that doesn't happen in the book; the themes of family, friendship and trust are barely touched on.Implausible IgnoranceThe main problem is that it's told from Bruno's viewpoint, and he is ridiculously naive and ignorant for the son of a senior Nazi. Not knowing, and not wanting to know, the horror of what was happening is entirely understandable (especially when a parent is involved). However, he hasn't heard of \"the Fatherland\", thinks the Fuhrer is called The Fury (throughout), that Auschwitz is called \"Out With\" and that \"Heil Hitler\" means \"goodbye\"! Yet we're meant to believe that he's the 9 year old son of a senior Nazi! His father had clearly been neglecting his duty to train the next generation of Hitler youth. And anyway, the puns wouldn't work in German. What is even more insulting to readers is that Boyne has responded to this widespread point of criticism by saying that anyone who thinks the boy is too naive is denying the holocaust! (See Kelly H. (Maybedog) comment on Oct 02, 2012 and subsequent ones).Other Flaws* Surely some aspects of Schmuel's plight would have been glaringly obvious (emaciated, shorn hair, possibly lice-ridden, ragged clothes etc)?* There are several stock phrases that are trotted out annoyingly often (\"a Hopeless Case\", \"mouth in the shape of an O\", \"if he was honest as he always tried to be\").* They talk of miles not kilometres and feet not centimetres, which might not matter were the rest of it more realistic.* Just occasionally, and completely out of character, Bruno talks in an unnaturally adult way (\"If you ask me we're all in the same boat. And it's leaking\", and a nasty person who \"always looked as if he wanted to cut someone out of his will\").It might have worked better if Bruno had been 5 or 6, but I suppose the target audience would have been less willing to read it, so the result is a book that isn't really suitable for any age group. What a waste.Postscript 1Arising from Kelly Hawkins' review:Boyne says:I think the most frequent criticism of the book in the years since it\u2019s been published is that Bruno is too naive. People say: \u201cHe\u2019s verging on the stupid \u2013 how could he not know?\u201d For all the criticisms you can make, I always feel that\u2019s the wrong one because he\u2019s grown up in a house with his father wearing a uniform, so I always think why would be question it? There wouldn\u2019t be any motivation for him to suddenly turn around\u2026 if your father came home wearing a doctor\u2019s uniform every day, you wouldn\u2019t turn around one day and ask: \u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201dSo, Bruno is kind of representing that blindness, in a way. When he goes to the fence, and when he asks that question, he is kind of representing the rest of us who are trying to understand the Holocaust and find some answers to it. Also, when the camps were liberated, the world was surprised through 1945 and 1946. The majority of the Holocaust had taken place over four years and, granted, it was a different information age but I still maintain that in those sorts of movies, the naivety is appropriate. It\u2019s based on real life.From: http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Books-Re...Elsewhere, he is quoted as saying that naivety and complacency were two of the main reasons the Holocaust occurred (http://yareviews.wikispaces.com/The+B...).I find that a very unsatisfying defence. It answers why people don't want to know the horrors (which I fully acknowledge), but does not begin to tackle Bruno's specific ignorance of common words related to the Third Reich. Postscript 2, October 2015His new book has a similar title and another Nazi theme - with Hitler himself this time: The Boy at the Top of the Mountain. I won't be reading that, but I suspect it will cause similar controversy.Postscript 3See this excellent review by a survivor of Nazi concentration camps.

The author John Boyne did a masterful job of depicting the setting in such vivid detail and exposing the events in a manner that I felt a constant emotional pull as the story unfolded and impending doom lingered on the horizon.I was recommended this novel a while back while reading The Book Thief, but after finishing that story and experiencing such deep sadness, I knew I couldn\u2019t jump into another novel about the Holocaust for quite some time. I\u2019m glad I waited because as with other works that cover this topic, distance and perspective is key. I feel the author did a grand job of juxtaposing two resounding themes in such a flawless manner; one being of the  evil  that was the Holocaust; against the second theme that of the innocence of a child. I thought it was brilliant of Boyne to tell the story from the perspective of a nine year old German boy as you experience the events of this abominable and unthinkable time in history as a mere complicit bystander, which ultimately leaves you with a sense of hopelessness. The story unfolds the day Bruno arrives home to discover his family is moving from Berlin to Auschwitz where his father will serve as a Commandant for the concentration camp. Bruno is forced to leave his three best friends for life and discovers that life in Auschwitz is lonely and desolate. All that changes the day he meets a boy his exact age and they begin to forge a friendship over the course of year. However, as much as he finds he and Schmuel have in common, living on opposite sides of the fence proves to have a devastating consequence to their friendship.After completing this book, I did some research on the author and the novel and found that he not only received well deserved praise for this book, but also harsh criticism. As with any piece of literature, when words are committed to page and presented to an audience for their interpretation there will be varying degrees of acceptance and backlash.

An archaic reference in the publishing industry to the notion that the way to ensure a book is a bestseller is to write about Lincoln, dogs, or doctors. This prompted one author to title his book which is about publishing in the 1930s Lincoln\u2019s Doctor\u2019s Dog.-\tFrom www.metaphordogs.orgMaybe Lincoln, doctors and dogs have gone out of fashion; but children, the Holocaust and friendship are still the rage. So the sure-fire formula for creating a bestseller is to write a story about children\u2019s friendship during the Holocaust\u2026\u2026even if you don\u2019t know the first thing about it.The Boy in Striped Pyjamas is the heart-warming (read \u201cemotionally manipulative\u201d) story of the doomed friendship between two pre-teen boys, born on the same day (one Jew and one the son of a Nazi) and its inevitable tragic conclusion. Yes, that\u2019s right: get your handkerchiefs here, folks.When I review a book, I look at both the medium and the content. Sometimes, you will find a great story which is badly written: at other times, a story which is only so-so will be made palatable through great prose. Sometimes you have both, and the book becomes really enjoyable. And when the medium and the content are so aptly intertwined to be inseparable, you have a truly great book.Very rarely, you have the misfortune to encounter a really abominable story which is abysmally written into the bargain \u2013 this happened to me with this book. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is a very fast read.Now for the analysis.The BackgroundThis book is historical fiction (yes, yes, I know that the author has claimed it is a fable situated in the time of the Holocaust: but unfortunately, the Holocaust is history) yet it pays no heed to historical accuracy. Auschwitz, according to my knowledge, had no children \u2013 they were sent to gas chambers the moment they arrived. Yet here we have a camp which is literally crawling with kids, almost like a kindergarten.We also have a German child Bruno, who despite being the son of a high-ranking Nazi officer who is very close to Hitler, does not know about Aryans, Jews and the concentration camps. Agreed, he may not be aware of the atrocities going on in those places: but in the real world, he would have been inducted into the fairy tales about Aryan supremacy and the \u201cJewish problem\u201d. In the book, Bruno remains blissfully ignorant about all until the end. He almost seems mentally challenged.My knowledge about Auschwitz comes from reading history books only, but as far as I know, the camps were guarded by electrified fences and patrolled heavily across the clock. It would not have been easy for somebody just to lift up the barbed wire and crawl in. And how was Schmuel (the Jewish boy) able to constantly evade the guards and come to the same spot at the fence where it was loose at the bottom? (Yeah, it\u2019s a fable, I know: maybe the exigencies of plot also had to do with the historical manipulation?)CharacterisationBruno is easily one of the most annoying protagonists ever created. Naivet\u00e9 one can understand \u2013 it is difficult to understand outright stupidity. The boy simply refuses to see what happens in front of his eyes. Even if he has not been indoctrinated (impossible, as mentioned earlier, in Nazi Germany), he would have picked up much more. Children do.Most of the other characters are pasteboard, including Schmuel, the Jewish kid, put there as props to support the plot and move it along. They are all one-dimensional other than the servant Maria and the Jewish doctor-turned-waiter Pavel. But they serve only to fill the space around Bruno.The WritingI could have forgiven Mr. Boyne for all these historical blunders and failures in characterisation, had he written good prose. But that is the most terrible part of the book \u2013 the prose is puerile.First, the repetition. Bruno\u2019s mouth forms an \u201cO\u201d and his hands stretch out at his sides whenever he is surprised, which is quite often: ultimately I started picturing him as a cartoon stick figure I used to draw as a kid. We are told that his sister Gretel is a Hopeless Case every time she is mentioned. The same with Father\u2019s office being Out Of Bounds At All Times And No Exceptions\u2026 I could go on and on.As a teen, I used to watch Hollywood war movies in which all Germans spoke English. While I could understand that this gimmick was required to avoid subtitles, sometimes they spoke English with a German accent\u2026 maybe to highlight their \u201cGerman-ness\u201d \u2026 this I found ridiculous. I had the same feeling about the puns Boyne used in this novel (\u201cFury\u201d for Fuhrer and \u201cOut-with\u201d for Auschwitz). I don\u2019t even know whether they will work in German. However, the biggest problem was the child\u2019s POV. It\u2019s just idiotic\u2026 an adult talking baby talk and trying to imitate a child. Once in a while, the adult pops out from behind the visage (\u201cwe are all in the same boat, and it\u2019s leaking\u201d). It\u2019s just tiresome.The narrative was problematic. Half the time, I was not sure whether the author was writing an adult\u2019s novel with a child\u2019s viewpoint, or a mature novel for children \u2013 it fails on both counts. As I said before, the child\u2019s POV does not work, and even with all the toned-down violence it\u2019s not a suitable novel for children.And plot holes\u2026 don\u2019t get me talking about them! From the loose fence under which one can crawl through, the story jumps from hole to hole till it drops into the biggest hole of them all, the tragic finale. By that time, Boyne is pushing all the emotional buttons, trying to bring the tears on at full throttle\u2026 but the real tragedy here is the death of literature.I understand that this book is a bestseller, and I can understand the reasons. I regret to say that this seems to me like adroit marketing of human tragedy\u2026 successful in this case.", "num_likes": 157, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/37205735", "review_id": "37205735", "date": "Nov 08, 2008", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Betsy", "user_url": "/user/show/221050-betsy", "text": "I'll give it this much.

Bruno is incredibly na\u00efve (to the point where I began to wonder whether he might not be mentally retarded, in which case he would most likely have been murdered under the Nazi euthanasia program long before the timeline of the book, thus sparing us this novel!) and thinks that the men in the striped pajamas whom he can see from his upstairs window are all on vacation, until he meets another boy (in the striped pajamas) named Schmuel and befriends him.Apparently, calling this book a \u201cfable\u201d precluded any attempt at historical accuracy or psychological acuity on the author\u2019s part. First, the premise that a nine-year-old boy in Nazi Germany wouldn\u2019t know who the F\u00fchrer was or what Heil Hitler meant is absolutely ludicrous (as is his ridiculous \u201cmishearing\u201d of F\u00fchrer as \u201cFury\u201d, which only works in English and not in German, where the word for \"fury\" is \"Zorn\" or \"Wut\"!) Bruno, at nine, is one year shy of mandatory membership in the Hitler-Jugend, and his sister Gretel, at 12, would have been in the BDM for the previous TWO years and moreover the children of a high-ranking SS officer would absolutely have known who Hitler was and not mixed up his name. So that gave me pause from about page 5 on. Bruno would be marginally more believable as a four- or five-year-old but then John Boyne wouldn\u2019t have been able to give him a Jewish counterpart. Even though there were some \u2013 VERY FEW! \u2013 little children who managed to survive Auschwitz, the chances that a five-year-old would have done so would be much smaller than even a nine-year-old\u2019s capacity to survive the initial selections and the work that was meant to slowly kill the inmates. Then add in all the other implausibilities such as not Bruno's not knowing what \u201cJews\u201d were or even the word \"Jew\", when Bruno would have been assaulted by propaganda against Jewish people virtually since his birth in 1934! Apparently, Bruno also doesn\u2019t know what an air-raid is, even though he\u2019s lived through them. REALLY? Then there is the part where the fence at Auschwitz is not only not electrified, and doesn\u2019t have guards and guarddogs, but even has a hole at the bottom. PLEASE! People didn\u2019t wander in and out of Auschwitz at will, or it would have been a very different place! Boyne\u2019s Nazis read like Colonel Klink in terms of their planning, not like the highly efficient mass-murderers they were. And let\u2019s not get started on how Schmuel apparently has the ability to mysteriously vanish from the constant Appells and the backbreaking labor that\u2019s probably the only reason he\u2019s still alive. And more trivially, Bruno wouldn't be reading Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island - he'd be much more likely to be reading Karl May!All of my criticisms make me think that Boyne did absolutely no research on German history, the German language, Nazis, the Holocaust or Auschwitz, and I'm beyond irritated to find out that this book is being touted as \"the new Diary of Anne Frank\" and indeed, replacing that work for kids in some schools. This book trivializes the Holocaust and the murder of millions by turning these things into a feeble allegory about the universality of ethnic hatred and positing that all we really need are two boys who can crawl under the fences to each other. Blech! I don\u2019t understand why Boyne chose the Holocaust as its setting, as the novel says nothing meaningful about the Holocaust at all, its maudlin chocolate-box sentimentality (UGH, THE ENDING!) and simplistic narration in fact undercut the idea that Germans were willfully blind to what was being done in their name. Bruno\u2019s not just ignorant; he\u2019s actually stupid. Perhaps the story would have worked from the perspective of, say, Bruno\u2019s mother, and her blindness to what her husband was doing because his work assured them of a comfortable existence. But then again, I\u2019m not sure anything could have saved this pretentious twaddle!Save your money and buy the non-fiction The Diary of Anne Frank or Night by Elie Wiesel, or if you\u2019re set on a fictional tale about the Holocaust, then choose The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, which is a hell of a lot more believable even if it is narrated by Death himself!", "num_likes": 130, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2009", "ww2", "fiction", "historical-fiction", "germany"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1940160169", "review_id": "1940160169", "date": "Mar 12, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Phrynne", "user_url": "/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "text": "I have actually sat for five full minutes gazing at a blank page and wondering what to say about this book.

There is much to dislike. From certain perspectives, it can even be said to be detestable.First of all, there is the authorial conceit that the work is written from the perspective of a child. The worst example of this come in the use of euphemisms for the Fuhrer ('the Fury') and for Auschwitz ('Out With') which become increasingly irritating as the work progresses. Bruno's 'difficulty' with these words is somehow supposed to charm us, and apparently gives the reader 'in the know' a soft, patronising glow which is presumably there to create a certain kind of sympathy for Bruno. It is interesting to note that Bruno apparently had no difficulty with the Boy in the Striped Pyjamas's name of Schmuel (maybe he could have referred to him as the 'mule'?). The same tweeness is in the description of the prison garb as 'striped pyjamas', although that is less irritating. It is really pushing the envelope to assume that Bruno is as naive as depicted. At age 8/9 he would have been in school, and subject to the indoctrination of the Hitler Youth; and he certainly would have been fully aware of not only Hitler, but how to pronounce Fuhrer!Indeed, it is this apparent ignorance of even the most basic things about Hitler's Germany, and it's attitude to Jews, that would have been brainwashed into the minds of German Youth, that is hardest to come to grips with. The author's 'childlike' writing permits him to draw several obscuring veils over the whole question. Even at the end, as Bruno and Schmuel go hand in hand into the 'darkness' and 'disappear' there is really nothing to indicate what happened to them. A child reading this, without any awareness of the horrors of Auschwitz, could be forgiven for believing simply that they 'disappeared' into some mysterious unknown. Thus despite its cutesy language, the book is obviously intended to be read by adults who presumably DO know what happened to them; and that fact alone makes the writing condescending and patronising to say the least.Since the reader is presumed to know these things, they will also know that the situation described in the book could never have happened. There is sufficient doubt whether any 8/9 year-old child would have ever survived past the first few hours at Auschwitz, except as possible 'medical experiment' subjects; it is hard to believe that Schmuel could have consistently been able to meet Bruno for the period of a whole year without being discovered and dealt with; and in any case, would he really have had access to a depot where other 'striped pyjamas of Bruno's size were stored?... And, by the way, isn't it lucky that Schmuel speaks German? Had he been from some other country and spoken a different language, who knows how the story might have gone?These are just some of the many irritations to be found in the book. The author has tried to justify it by arguing that the story is a fable, and that these things don't matter. But if it is a fable, then fables usually teach a moral of some kind. What is the moral in this story? Don't trust in the friendship of Jews? Innocence and ignorance is no protection for awful things to happen to you? The fact that people feel saddened by the ending, or even shocked by it, is even more repellent: the sadness seems to be reserved for poor, innocent, ignorant Bruno, who goes to his death still innocent, and still ignorant. Because of the 'hiding' of the reality of the Auschwitz atrocities, the whole situation regarding Schmuel and the other victims seems to disappear, just as Schmuel and Bruno do. Sad, isn't it?I cannot help but feel deep repulsion towards this 'fable'. That such a deeply offensive approach is somehow apparently easily disregarded because of a twee authorial trick of using sweet, sugary language, and helps make it such a popular, 'safe' book (no nasties crawling about here!) makes me despair at the dulling of any critical facilities or acumen on behalf of the public who love it. The book is inane, badly written, historically inaccurate, lacking in any sense of moral teaching (no one in the book 'learns' anything, or even changes their attitude to anything) and is hardly inspiring.

He lives with his parents, his 12-year-old sister Gretel and maids, one of whom is called Maria. After a visit by Adolf Hitler, Bruno's father is promoted to Commandant, and the family has to move to \"Out-With\" because of the orders of \"The Fury\" (Bruno's naive interpretation of the word \"F\u00fchrer\"). Bruno is initially upset about moving to Out-With (in actuality, Auschwitz) and leaving his friends, Daniel, Karl and Martin. From the house at Out-With, Bruno sees a camp in which the prisoners wear \"striped pyjamas\" (prison clothes). One day, Bruno decides to explore the strange wire fence. As he walks along the fence, he meets a Jewish boy named Shmuel, who he learns shares his birthday. Shmuel says that his father, grandfather, and brother are with him on this side of the fence, but he is separated from his mother. Bruno and Shmuel talk and become very good friends, although Bruno still does not understand very much about Shmuel and his side of the fence. Nearly every day, unless it's raining, Bruno goes to see Shmuel and sneaks him food. As he visits Shmuel more and more, and Shmuel gets more and more skinny, Bruno's naivete is proved, as he never realizes he is living beside a concentration camp.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e

read The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, I won\u2019t rehash what can be read in the blurb and I\u2019m going to limit my review to the few points I found to be most important.This is a YA novel and the easy, simple way in which it is written really punctuates one of the main themes; the innocence and naivet\u00e9 of children.At times I felt Bruno was a bit of a spoiled turd. I then felt guilty for feeling that way. I\u2019m not sure I need to feel guilty though. After all, don\u2019t most nine year olds behave like turds every now and then? It didn\u2019t make me like him any less.I appreciated the way the relationship between his parents was portrayed. Most if it went over Bruno\u2019s head which, once again, illustrated his naivet\u00e9 and the often false sense of security children feel within their family.There is so much to be said out Bruno\u2019s looking out his window and imagining a life for the people he saw which was so far off from their experience. This would be a great discussion point for a book club.Bruno\u2019s friendship with Shmuel created an anxiety that made turning the pages both compelling and daunting.That ending! Wow, I really didn\u2019t see that coming until the very last minute. I can\u2019t really discuss without spoilers but I can think of several themes folded in. And those last sentences? Scary and timely! It could definitely inspire a very lively book club discussion/debate.Although I found the book to be very sad and very touching, it didn\u2019t make me cry the way I had anticipated. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be sad. I had been warned on multiple occasions to read with a box of tissue at my side. I\u2019m certainly glad I read this book and continue to be a huge fan of Boyne\u2019s work.", "num_likes": 92, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fiction", "family-dynamics", "ya", "great-for-book-club", "historical-fiction", "wwii"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2971306383", "review_id": "2971306383", "date": "Sep 10, 2019", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Hamad", "user_url": "/user/show/54464244-hamad", "text": "This Review \u270d\ufe0f Blog \ud83d\udcd6 Twitter \ud83d\udc26 Instagram \ud83d\udcf7\n\u201cWhat exactly was the difference?

And who decided which people wore the striped pajamas and which people wore the uniforms?\u201d\n\u2605 I picked this because I heard a lot of good things about the author\u2019s writing and I like the book\u2019s name but I did not know what it is about. I did not even read the synopsis!\u2605 The writing was light hearted and I think having the book revolving about Bruno was a great idea! The innocence of the young did reach me and the darkness of the adult world was also delivered! This kind of reminds me of Fredrik Backman\u2019s writing, easy to get into, funny but yet it delivers an emotional punch.\u2605 The characters were great and although the MC is a 9 year old boy, the story is not for young kids and nor will they understand it. This has a wide set of characters that felt so real to me from Bruno\u2019s family, his dad and the fury to the boy in the striped Pajamas.\u2605 The plot was great and if you check my GR shelves, I added this to my Tear-Worthy books. I am not a big fan of stories on war, and historical fictions are not for me in general. But this was one of the times that a book could teach me about history more than 12 years in school did.\u2605 The pacing was crazy fast, this can be literally read in one sitting. The meeting of the boys happened at almost exactly 50% and things got more interesting after that. If I am going to criticize one thing is that this felt too short and I wanted more to live with these characters. I expected a different ending and when I was approaching it, I thought it was going to be rushed but it was not. It just destroyed me in the best possible way and then I went and watched the ending of the movie on Youtube which had brilliant actors and it helped in destroying what remained of me.\n\u201cSitting around miserable all day won\u2019t make you any happier.\u201d\n\u2605 Summary and Prescriptions: I prescribe this for everyone, please go and read this.

Most of the time they came across something interesting that was just sitting there, minding its own business, waiting to be discovered (such as America). Other times they discovered something that was probably best left alone (like a dead mouse at the back of a cupboard).\u201dA remarkable, simply told \u2018fable\u2019, as the title says \u2013 a parable about a boy who realises if he wants answers to his questions, he\u2019s going to have to discover them for himself. Mostly, he just wants to know why he has to put up with rules and be lonely and uncomfortable.Bruno is a nine-year old boy living a privileged life in a big house in Berlin with his parents and his annoying twelve-year-old sister, Gretel. When the story opens, he walks into his bedroom and discovers the maid packing up all his things. He tries to think what he\u2019s done wrong and worries that he\u2019s being sent away. No, they\u2019re all moving because of Father\u2019s job promotion. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him. But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her.\u201dGretel can go \u2013 she treats him with nothing but disdain, anyway (as only an almost-teenaged girl can do). But he doesn\u2019t want to leave his three best friends. He doesn\u2019t think Father should have to move just because of his job and his shiny new uniform. Even if Father moves, why do the rest of them have to go live far away?After the move, he\u2019s annoyed by the many other men in uniform who come and go from his father\u2019s office in their new \u2018home\u2019. Mostly, he dislikes Lieutenant Kotler, a nineteen year old soldier who calls Bruno \u201clittle man\u201d and with whom young Gretel tries to flirt outrageously. Kotler starts out handsome and cheerful but later hardens, to the point that Bruno explains one reason \u201c. . . why he didn\u2019t like Lieutenant Kotler. There was the fact that he never smiled and always looked as if he was trying to find somebody to cut out of his will.\u201dWhat would make a nine-year-old think about wills? I think this is Bruno, using what he knows of life from an adventure story of someone off to seek their fortune (maybe because they've been cut out of a will). He lives in his head.This is written from Bruno\u2019s na\u00efve perspective, informed only by his stories and some eavesdropping. He\u2019s confused by the changed behaviour of their servants. He\u2019s openly frustrated by the restrictiveness of their new home, where people whisper (or shout) behind closed doors, but nobody answers his questions about the big fence outside their house and the people he can see in the distance. His innocence and curiosity are nicely contrasted with his sister\u2019s feigned sophistication. He begins exploring to learn more about where he is and to try to find a friend. This began so quietly and simply, that I wondered if it would hold my interest. (It did.) It can be hard to believe how carefree and trusting a nine-year-old is who\u2019s faced no challenges other than how to sneak an extra bit of dessert.Even quite young readers will be able to read it, although they may miss the subtleties which appear as tiny observations throughout. And they will need some explanation of the names and words that Bruno misunderstands.

I have thought about it a lot which is generally a sign of good writing, but in this case, maybe I am thinking about it because the book disturbed me.If I look at the Holocaust historical fiction genre as a whole, I am not sure what this book adds to the group. It does show another point of view, from the child of the Commandant of Auschwitz, but Bruno is so terrifically dense--naive well beyond his nine years--that I am not sure what the point is. Bruno talks to his Jewish friend on the other side of the fence for over a year--he lives in his house which also serves as the headquarters of Auschwitz for over a year--and I am supposed to believe that he doesn't have any clue what is going on in the camp? I know children are narcissistic and self involved, but this book takes that idea to a whole other level. Bruno's tunnel vision is so great that I keep wondering if maybe that it was some sort of message that the author was trying to get across. Maybe that kids can create and live in an alternate reality as long as they need to? Was that the point? If not, what was the point? Surely it wasn't the shocking ending that served little in adding to the greater story of the Holocaust. The ending served no purpose. It didn't make the father see what was wrong, it didn't make the guards question what they were doing, it didn't make the Jews who died in the camp any less tragic, what was the ending's purpose? My guess is just shock value.I do think the book makes an excellent argument for being honest with children in even the worst circumstances. By trying to protect kids and shield kids, adults put them in greater danger!I will say one positive thing, I thought the non-traditional book jacket was a good marketing ploy. By not giving away any of the plot points, it makes the reader intrigued. But, overall, I am flummoxed.

I haven't seen the movie, and I really had no idea what to expect from this one. That being said, I wish I could have liked it more than I did. This story is told in 3rd person limited, from the perspective of a 9 year old boy. Bruno, our main character, is moved unexpectedly from his large home with 5 floors (if you count the basement and the little room with the high window at the top) in Berlin to Out-With, where the house is only 3 floors (if you count the basement) where he's bored, has no friends, nowhere to explore, and nothing to do except look at the people behind the fence wearing the striped pajamas. Bruno doesn't know who the people behind the fence are, or why they are there, or... well, anything. And it just wasn't believable to me that he should be so obliviously naive, which is one of the major issues that I had with this book, and a big part of why I found it so disappointing in the end. I have a few reasons for not believing in Bruno's \"innocence\". First, Bruno was born in Berlin in 1934, well into the Nazi party's regime. I cannot find it in myself to believe that Bruno could have lived 9 years in this environment of anti-Semitism and have never even heard of a Jew before. This kid went to public school, and hung around other boys both his age and older. Bruno's own father is in the Nazi military, had \"The Fury\" to his house for dinner, and was personally given orders by \"The Fury\". I don't believe that the term \"Jew\" was never, not once, used in Bruno's presence, by someone at school, or on the street (which is so busy that you could be pushed from pillar to post, specifically), or in his own household. People who hate, especially in an environment where that hatred is not only tolerated but encouraged and treated as \"right\", generally hate vociferously. It's not something we're born with, it's something we must be taught. That's how racism works. So it doesn't make sense to me that someone who obviously believes that Jews are inferior, who feels that Germans have been wronged by the Jews, who feels that Jews should be punished, and that those who disagree are cowards at best and traitors at worst, as Bruno's father clearly seems to believe, would fail to delineate the \"us\" from the \"them\" to his son. And Bruno is not stupid, though he is rather self-centered, and sees everything around him in terms of his own life experiences. But he notices things, even if he doesn't understand them or their significance. And we see in the course of the story that when he's curious enough about something, he'll ask for information about it, even if he doesn't really learn the right info, since usually his equally self-centered and ignorant sister is providing the answers. But still, it just doesn't work for me that he should be portrayed as such an innocent blank slate. I grew up in an area where racism was very common, but thankfully my mom taught me differently - and started doing so early, by which I mean around the time I could talk. Very young children mimic, and at some point every child will have heard something they shouldn't have and then repeated it. It's inevitable. Young children also ask a bajillion embarrassing questions. \"Mommy, why is that lady's skin so dark?\" \"Mommy, why is that man so fat?\" \"Mommy, why does that man get a yellow star? I want a star!\" Just ask Louis CK about the Why Game. I don't have kids, but even I know that it's never ending. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Over and over and over...Any of these kinds of things would have been perfect times for Nazi Dad to say, \"Well, little Bruno, that man gets a star because he's a Jew, and we're rounding him, his family, and everyone like him up so that we can cleanse the earth of their filth.\" But he didn't, apparently, which begs the question: Why not? Nazis were in power, and they even had programs specifically designed for indoctrinating kids. But little Bruno was kept ignorant of the attitudes of the period. Because if he hadn't been, then this story wouldn't be possible: Bruno wouldn't have been that innocent, naive, oblivious blank slate he had to be. And that's a huge plot hole for me, and a big disappointment. Moving along to the writing itself, I have to say that, again, it was something of a disappointment. Well, the writing wasn't terrible, but some of the techniques used within it were irritating as hell. Like this line: \"The rope was easy enough to find as there were bales of it in the basement of the house and it didn't take long to do something extremely dangerous and find a sharp knife and cut as many lengths of it as he thought he might need.\" First, why does the narrator feel the need to specify that knives are dangerous? Because Bruno is 9? Secondly, not only is it a run-on sentence, but what exactly is \"extremely dangerous\"? Finding the sharp knife, or using it? Third, why even mention the tool used at all? Why not just say \"The rope was easy enough to find as there were bales of it in the basement of the house and it didn't take long to cut as many lengths of it as he thought he might need.\" It feels very much as if the narrator was talking down to the reader, and trying to protect them perhaps? I'm not a huge fan of that. Let readers think for themselves.Another two examples of this protection thing: 1) The narrator has a bad habit of editing out the terms the Nazis used to describe Jews. \"'Hey, you!' he shouted, then adding a word that Bruno did not understand. 'Come over here, you--' He said the word again, and something about the harsh sound of it made Bruno look away and feel ashamed to be part of this at all.\" Bruno may not know the term, but why edit it? Let's look at Harry Potter for a second. When Hermione is first called a Mudblood by Draco Malfoy, it's not edited out, despite Harry not knowing the term. Instead, he picks up from context that it's derogatory and ugly, and we, as the reader, do the same. That's the proper way to communicate to readers, and to trust them to understand and be shocked by the term and its intent. 2) The narrator cuts away from anything resembling violent action. In a scene where a Jewish waiter spills wine on a Nazi soldier, we're treated to this: \"What happened then was both unexpected and extremely unpleasant. [Nazi] grew very angry with [Jew] and no one [...] stepped in to stop him doing what he did next, even though none of them could watch.\" I edited out names, but regarding the action in that scene, that's it. Of course, we can imagine what happened. Of course, we know how brutal Nazis, and people in general, can be. But then at the end of the story, we're left with these lines: \"Of course all this happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again. Not in this day and age.\"Nice. Some reverse psychology there. Tell us nothing like that could happen now, because we're all so tolerant and peaceful. The object is that we start questioning whether it could happen, or even whether it could be happening now. Subtle. Except again it's a fail, because we learn nothing at all from this book. What's the point? \"Pay attention\"? To what? If Boyne is not even willing to call out the behavior we're supposed to think is so bad, not willing to show people how needlessly cruel and brutal and inhumanly awful people have been to others, what the hell is stopping us from being way that now? We wouldn't recognize it if we saw it. We don't learn anything by promoting ignorance and whitewashing the past. Bruno may not have understood what was happening around him, but a skilled writer takes that character's lack of understanding and shows the reader the truth. Boyne tried his hand at this, and succeeded in a small way, in that the reader understood more of what the Jews were going through than Bruno did, but too much was avoided in the guise of protecting the reader, and overall, it failed. Bruno never learned anything. He never grew as a character. He was as self-centered at the end as he was in the beginning. Disappointing. This book could have been so amazingly powerful by showing the true horror of Auschwitz through the eyes of a child. But it didn't. It shied away from everything that would have meant something. And that's the biggest disappointment of all.

I checked out the audio CDs (only four) and the book as well from the local library. My verdict: It's good, except maybe for the end. I liked it. It's a novel. It doesn't have to be realistic. Or graphic. Or abstract.The titular boy in the striped pajamas is a literary device, a conduit for pouring another reality into the protagonist's life, otherwise dominated by such ordinary concerns as sibling rivalry and the demands of parents. That's the challenge, isn't it?--to get our heads above our own daily concerns (especially if we're safe and comfortable). I'm not sure confrontation with death and mayhem, much less abstract ideas, would make as much of an impression on the children and teenagers of today's world. For that we need the art of the novelist.At first I didn't like the ending, not because it was realistic or unrealistic, or happy or unhappy, but because of the jarring switch from the way the way the literary device was working...to something else. But after a few days I was okay with the ending, which I think cuts against culturally programmed expectations of the plot.Now, as to who may write (or, for that matter, say) what, and how, and the efforts to enforce that by ridicule, condemnation, or shaming, that's the attempted exercise of power. Think about the charge of cultural appropriation. Think of the accusation of microaggression. Groups who have traditionally been limited in what they can say (and think) would like to return the favor. But two wrongs don't make a right, as I've oft been told myself. I previously looked into this author's work and found that only this book and none of his others has become such a blockbuster. He's touched or captured something; the book is a phenom, and attacks are publicity.At any rate, I'm for free speech and against censorship. If you don't like it, do it better. Make it about what you want to say, since targeting somebody else isn't going to lift you. Or, if you have to protest, consider going after Holocaust romance instead of this one. (Yes, there is Holocaust romance.)Addendum, April 16, 2017In my review proper, I framed the controversy over this book both as one of power and one of free speech--huge topics to which I just alluded. Here's a related topic, one concerning teaching ten-year-0lds. The two topics overlap assuming The Boy in the Striped Pajamas gets assigned to young readers. What gets taught in public schools has long been a flashpoint for controversy.Last year a teacher in the Atlanta metropolitan area used an interactive teaching method (\"game\") to teach about slavery in her fifth-grade classroom. One black student complained of being distressed to her grandmother, who was not satisfied with the response she received from the school and took to social media in posts that went viral. The young teacher was reportedly a stand-out at her job who was supported in this instance by her principal and fellow teachers. The student reportedly told her that what had disturbed (triggered?) her was not the \"game,\" but slavery. The grandmother wasn't satisfied, though. I used to have high expectations of the education writer for The Atlanta Journa-Constitution, but in this case I thought she was caught up in the fray beyond her ability to be objective. Although she started out observing that the teaching method in question had been reasonable, she switched to a disapproving posture after soliciting advice from an outside expert who implied that teaching by means of a \"game\" meant \"fun and games\" and that the teacher was making light of slavery. She also implied white privilege was involved. (The teacher is white, and it appears the outside specialist is as well.)I was struck that the whole debate had become, not an exercise in reason, but a set-up (albeit made subtle by the appearance of reason) according to which the teacher's guilt was foreordained by who she is. Also, I can't see how the use of another teaching method (say, didactic, or discussion-based) would have precluded the ensuing kerfuffle, although the fact that the \"game\" had been used furnished a lot of ammunition.I don't know exactly what went down since I wasn't there. But neither was the outside specialist, and in her letter I could see her twisting words to justify her conclusion, which, sadly, swayed the education writer. In this case, power is more clearly the issue (rather than free speech), with the grandmother challenging societal authority as vested in the role of teacher. We are asking our teachers to teach ten-year-old children topics we have not figured out how to talk about as a society. And we are asking them to do so from a vulnerable position: social issues will be vented on them, and we don't stand behind them.Here's a link to an article containing further links, the first to an article about the situation that appeared in the local paper, and the third to a further article that includes a comment by me, writing as \"JaninAtlanta,\" although what I've written here today represents my latest thinking:https://heatst.com/culture-wars/teach...Here's one further link, to the article containing the whole letter from the outside expert:http://getschooled.blog.myajc.com/201...Of course, my thoughts in the review and in this addendum are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to who should be allowed to write or say what and to whom.Addendum, July 24, 2018Here is a more nuanced discussion than I was able to give. It's not just whether the book was reality- or fantasy-based but whether its author is upfront about the difference.

This book was not really about the Holocaust, it really was not about the relationship between a German boy and a Jewish boy during the Holocaust--it was a book that was just built up to that second to last chapter with the only purpose of making readers sad and angry and upset. I honestly feel like there is no other way to interpret this book other than it was a book that was writing for the sole purpose of making the reader distraught, to invoke some intense negative reaction. This book just wanted a reaction. I feel sad right now, yes, but that's because I actually have no other option; I was emotionally manipulated to feel this way. Little innocent boy meets other little innocent boy and horrible thing happens therefore I must feel upset, no questions asked, no room for other emotions or feelings or opinions. So yes, this book was sad and made me sad but that's all it did. And this emotional manipulation actually makes me kind of angry because I was expecting something really great, and, I don't know, profound from this book? I just almost feel betrayed. I wanted something great and instead I got a book that leaves no room for any personal interpretation, no real personal meaning. I don't want to sound insensitive (I don't think I do but I\"m just going to say this anyway): obviously the Holocaust was absolutely horrific and what happened at the end of this book was terrible but.....this book just didn't feel like the right way to write about this topic. And there really is no right way, I know that, but something about it just rubbed me the wrong way. It was an interesting point of view on the Holocaust, though, through the eyes of someone so innocent. But I can't believe that with a father like the one that Bruno had that after a year of living within 50 feet of Auschwitz Bruno still knew absolutely nothing about what was happening. That really is not realistic. If his father was running Auschwitz, you better believe his son would know why there were people there, generally what was happening, Bruno would have the mindset that he was better than Schmuel and everyone else in the camp. He may have been young, but children are incredibly impressionable and he would have believe anything his father told him.The point of view of this story was very interesting and it was different, I give it that. And I liked the writing style: it was very simple but there was a charm to it.

His father had received important military orders and the family was to leave their luxury home in Berlin to go someplace that Bruno had never heard of before. When Bruno saw his new home, he didn\u2019t like it all. Theirs was the only house on the road. And it was much smaller than their other home. And behind it was a big yard with a spiky fence all around it. A yard that contained small huts, several soldiers, and many, many men and boys all wearing identical striped pajamas with a matching cap. It was all very strange. Yes, Bruno didn\u2019t like this place at all. Bruno is innocent, na\u00efve, and an unlikely protagonist who neither recognizes nor understands the horrors of the concentration camp located behind his new home. Through his young and selfish lens, he only sees unfairness when he views the camp for why should there be so many boys on the other side of the fence who have one another to play with while he has no one? Bruno is absolutely angered by this injustice. Of course, the reader realizes what the true injustice is, which makes Bruno\u2019s self-centeredness all the more unpalatable. Boyne doesn\u2019t introduce readers to the boy in the striped pajamas until halfway through the book, which allows readers ample time to become acquainted with Bruno. During that period, we realize that Bruno\u2019s \u201cfaults\u201d are really just him being a small, sheltered, and unworldly boy of nine: he\u2019s thoughtless, scared, self-indulgent, petulant, and irrational. But Boyne also shows us a Bruno that is kindhearted, inquisitive, and who understands the value of maintaining a secret and the importance of keeping a promise. I\u2019ve read several books for both juvenile and young adult readers that deal with the Holocaust and concentration camps. This one is unique in that Boyne shows us the horror through two young boys of the same age, height, and physical features\u2014virtual mirror images of each other. Bruno is essentially the \u201cbefore\u201d while Shmuel, the boy in the striped pajamas, is the \u201cafter\u201d. One is German, well fed, idealistic, and blissfully ignorant while the other is Polish, gaunt, hopeless, and worn down by hate, starvation, and fear. It\u2019s a stark contrast and Boyne is able to successfully illustrate the horrors of war and bigotry without having to delve into graphic detail. Although this book is recommended for grades 9-12, its implied acts of violence (there is one brief mention of a dog being shot) and death make it suitable for younger readers although a knowledge of World War II would help put the subject matter into context. The use of repetition and puns also help to successfully reinforce key points and ideas for readers.Above its grisly subject matter, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a touching story about two lonely boys who find comfort and security through friendship.

I loathed the main character, I loathed the fact that the story to me had no point, and I especially loathed the author's air of self-satisfaction at having created \"A Fable.\" I reviewed it on my blog a long time ago; go here for the full text, or read the main argument below. Seriously, if someone can explain to me why you saw this as a good book or how you understood its point, I'd appreciate it. +++I didn't like the main character, so I hated the story, and I didn't see the point Mr. Boyne was going after, so I felt he wasted my time. Throughout the book, Mr. Boyne can't decide how ignorant either his readers are or Bruno should be. Bruno knows at one point that there's a war going on, but later, when his sister Gretel moves pins around a map of Europe, he doesn't understand what she's doing. He has never heard of Hitler (whom he calls \"The Fury\"), nor of Jews. If the author had made him five or six rather than nine, then this might have been believable; as it is, it feels completely author-constructed and -manipulated, and it made me have zilch respect for Bruno -- or less than zilch, actually, as he's also a spoiled, selfish, ignorant brat. The author seems to like him, or at least think he's an okay kid doing the best he can, but when Bruno deliberately turns a blind eye to his \"friend's\" suffering and beatings . . . not okay! Who wants to hang out with a kid like that?Boyne continues the ignorance game by keeping the name \"Auschwitz\" away from his readers with that \"Out-with\" -- a ploy I couldn't figure out, because if readers were approaching the story from the same ignorance as Bruno, they wouldn't have heard of Auschwitz, so it wouldn't matter if the name was included; and if readers knew anything about the Holocaust, they would see through it, and then it would come off as cutesy and evasive. The same is true of the ending: Without a knowledge of the Holocaust, readers would have had no idea Bruno went to the gas chamber, and therefore the story would have had no meaning for them. \"He disappeared? Is that all?\" If you have that knowlege, then I suppose you can recognize that Bruno has been punished for his ignorance, but without the main character grasping the message, the story is neither satisfying nor clear.And is that even Boyne's point? According to a number of reviews, yes; they claim Bruno's deliberate ignorance is an allegory for the willful blindness of adult Germans during the War. Perhaps so, but in that case, Boyne should have shown us Bruno's death scene so readers understood the consequences of such ignorance, no matter their prior knowledge of the situation; and the message would have been infinitely more effective if the book were written in first person or Bruno was at least respectable (if not likeable), so I gave a damn when he died. The musical \"Cabaret\" focuses on that same willful ignorance, but the moral power of the show arises from the audience's awareness of that ignorance throughout the debauchery onstage, and its creators' final condemnation of that ignorance and display of its effects in the last scene of the show. If this is Boyne's point also, he's removed all the teeth from it.

I really did. After all, how can one fail to be drawn in by a story about a German boy, the son of a high-ranking Nazi officer, who makes friends with a Jewish boy at Auschwitz, only to fail to understand his new friend's situation and meet a gruesome end with him? It's a great premise with plenty of scope for drama. A writer looking to fictionalise ignorance of the Holocaust would be hard-pressed to come up with a better idea.Sadly, I found myself rather underwhelmed by The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, for several reasons. Firstly, I didn't care for the main character, who is meant to pass for young and naive but really is rather selfish and obnoxious. Secondly, I found the faux-child-like tone of the book cloying and unconvincing, and thirdly, I was annoyed by the plot holes which kept popping up with alarming regularity. So while I admit the book is a page-turner and that I was keen to finish it to find out how it ended, I can't in good conscience give it more than two stars. To give it more than two stars would be an insult to better written books.I'll start with the plot holes. There are so many of those in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas that I hardly know where to begin. For starters, it beggars belief that a nine-year-old German boy from a prominent Nazi family should never have heard the word 'Jews', nor be aware of what the Nazis think of Jews. Even if his parents tried to shield him from the nastier aspects of war, which Bruno's parents certainly seem to do, he would have been indoctrinated with Nazi propaganda from a young age onwards and would have been quite familiar with the main tenets of National Socialism and its leader, Adolf Hitler. Thus Bruno's complete ignorance of the F\u00fchrer and the fact that Germany is at war is hard to buy. Similarly, it beggars belief that our young 'hero' could have near-daily conversations with a Jewish friend at Auschwitz for a year without having the faintest idea of what is going on in the camp. After over three hundred conversations with an obviously hungry and filthy friend, you'd think that even a self-centred boy like Bruno would realise that the camp is an unpleasant place where people starve, disappear and die, right? After all that time, it would also have to be blatantly obvious to him that the camp guards aren't very nice people. I know children aren't the most astute observers, but I refuse to believe that a nine-year-old boy who sees prisoners cower before guards, obviously scared, and then hears gunshots, would be surprised at the people on the ground not getting up, having to be carried away instead. Even in the 1940s, when children weren't exposed to action flicks to the extent they are now, boys surrounded by soldiers on a daily basis would have known what a gun was and what it did to the person it was pointed at. So the part of the book where Bruno watches Jewish prisoners being killed and thinks they are 'rehearsing a play' rang completely untrue to me. Quite frankly, I found it a little insulting to be expected to buy that kind of abject ignorance.Other plot holes? Well, I refuse to believe that a Jewish boy at Auschwitz could meet up with his friend outside the fence nearly every day for a year without ever being detected, or that there could be a hole in the fence big enough for a boy to slip through without any or indeed many of the other Jewish prisoners trying to escape through it. There is simply no way that could have happened in real life, and I scratch my head at Boyne's asking us to believe it. I also scratch my head at some of the less prominent historical plot holes in the book, such as the fact that Hitler and Eva Braun apparently visited people's homes without bodyguards (really?), or that the Germans apparently didn't check their officers' family backgrounds before putting them in charge of their largest concentration camps. Yeah, right. Like that would have happened.The book doesn't just contain historical inaccuracies, though. Another thing that put me off was the linguistic inaccuracies. For example, Bruno keeps calling Auschwitz 'Out-With' and the F\u00fchrer 'the Fury', ad nauseam, despite being corrected several times. These are mistakes no German child in his right mind (least of all the child of a high-ranking Nazi officer) would make, and they seriously got in the way of my appreciation of the story, as linguistic inaccuracies tend to do. To make matters worse, Boyne seems to expect us to believe that Shmuel, a nine-year-old boy from the Jewish ghetto in Cracow, Poland, is fluent in German, which is unlikely, even if his mother is a language teacher. In my opinion, such mistakes are inexcusable, even in works of fiction. I can't believe Boyne's editors didn't pick up on these things and make the necessary corrections.I didn't overly care for Boyne's style of writing, either. While I will (again) admit that I couldn't put The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas down (the premise is good and the tension is ramped up quite adequately), I disliked the pseudo-childish tone of the writing, which felt contrived and unnecessarily cutesy to me, and occasionally made me groan. Furthermore, I found the occasional excursions into Gretel and Shmuel's minds jarring; a more unified point of view (to wit, Bruno's) would have been preferable, in my opinion. Finally, I thought the final chapter felt rather tacked on, and several plot lines weren't tied up well enough for my liking. What was the point of Maria, for instance? What was her background, and what was her role in the story? I'm not sure I understand. I also think much more could have been made of several of the male characters -- Pavel and Bruno's father come to mind, or the eponymous boy in the striped pyjamas. As they are, they are cardboard cut-outs with no personality of their own. To be sure, this is partly because they are described from the point of view of a sensationally unimaginative nine-year-old, but still, I think Boyne could have done a better job infusing his characters with some personality. It would have made a flawed reading experience a bit more memorable.Finally, like other reviewers I'm having a hard time figuring out the point of the book. What are we supposed to take away from this story? That people can be staggeringly blind to evil, even when it is perpetrated right in front of them? Er, OK. Point taken. It could have been made in a less cloying and mistake-riddled manner, though.Way to ruin a promising premise, Mr Boyne.

But as to the novel itself (which I originally read in 2007 for a university graduate level course on Holocaust literature I was taking online for academic interest) I categorically and univocally have to say that I have seldom been confronted with and by a WWII and Holocaust themed children's novel I have found so annoyingly infuriating, so implausible and so problematically unreasonable as John Boyne's The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (and yes indeed, that was also the general and collective consensus from most of us students who were taking that online Holocaust literature course). Now I do indeed and very well realise that there is definitely more than a grain of truth in and behind John Boyne's premise that in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, main protagonist (and nine years of age) Bruno might well not be aware of the full horror of the death camps, of Auschwitz. However, considering that Bruno's father is not only a high ranking Nazi official but that he is also the commandant of Auschwitz, that therefore Bruno and his family live right in Auschwitz and that there are individuals in \"striped pyjamas\" behind the fence and so close that Bruno is able to make friends with a young Jewish boy named Shmuel, personally, I absolutely and completely tend to find the massive level of Bruno's presented ignorance of the Holocaust, of what Auschwitz is and what is represents majorly unbelievable and yes even for a young child of Bruno's age, especially since according to family members who actually were children in Germany during WWII, while the concentration and death camps were of course officially a state secret, it was generally a pretty much open secret of which many if not even most Germans were at least somewhat aware, even though they indeed often were not fully cognizant of the sheer and massive all encompassing level of evil and death that the National Socialists, that their so-called government had wrought and was still engaging in (and thus, the total and massively intense level of ignorance and naivet\u00e9 presented and shown by young Bruno in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas simply does not all that much work and feel reasonable and natural, especially considering his family, his father's job as commandant of Auschwitz and that Bruno and his family reside right at the source of the evil so to speak and in full view of the death camp). But still, I could probably have albeit with not much reading pleasure and only very grudgingly handled Bruno's ignorance and massive naiveness (as well as the rather annoying fact that he also seems totally visually oblivious and clueless of the fact that his new friend from \"behind the fence\" that his companion Shmuel as an Auschwitz prisoner would have and should have appeared malnourished, with ragged clothing and likely riddled with lice and fleas) had John Boyne, had the author not also tried to make Bruno into a young child with a speech impediment. For sorry, ALL of Bruno's linguistic faux pas do NOT work in German and since The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a novel both set in WWII Germany and features as a main protagonist a nine year old and therefore also unilingual German boy, NONE of the English language puns and mistakes Bruno makes are sensible and reasonable, thereby rendering Bruno as pretty well ridiculous and totally absurd. And truth be told, what has finally convinced me to only rank The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas with but one star and yes, also to finally reread and actually post a negative review (because The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is really NOT a novel I in any way would be wanting to reread, ever) is the plain and infuriating fact that I am personally MASSIVELY OFFENDED by John Boyne nastily, arrogantly and ignorantly spewing claims that those of us who have not enjoyed and appreciated his The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, that those of us who have found his narrative problematic and implausible are somehow akin and alike to those vile specimens who deny the Holocaust (since for one, this is at best a massively IGNORANT attitude in and of itself and for two, John Boyne with this and at least in my humble opinion actually enables and helps those who do in fact actively deny the Holocaust).

Bruno, along with his father, mother, and sister and various servants move from their quaint home in Berlin to live in a house on the outskirts of the prison where Bruno and his sister Gretel can view the unfortunate occupants living behind the fence. Without friends or much to do besides his studies and books, Bruno befriends Shmuel, a young Polish boy of Jewish descent who lives on the other side of the fence. The two meet up over a year or so, and while seemingly different at first, the two come to learn that they have a lot in common. Author John Boyne targets the rather ignorant innocence and refusal to face facts of a portion of the German population at the time under the Third Reich (personified as Bruno), to mixed results. While this book isn't historically accurate with some of the conditions of the camp as pointed out by critics, the argument could be made that Boyne isn't trying to be accurate but introduce a generation of younger readers to the blind ignorance of a collection of people, organisations, governments, and countries through an unfortunately horrific prominent event in Western psyche. Auschwitz and the other death camps are a dark stain on humanity, and no words can fully describe the awful conditions placed upon people there. The cruelty to fellow human beings at such a scale isn't isolated to WWII and Germany, and many times we forget that there are both historical and even contemporary events that mimic the fanaticism of that time. Being able to see the complexities of the German psyche under the Third Reich is an opportunity to analyse our own societies, particularly today with the rise of similarly aggressive ideas, political parties, and governments. Instead of Auschwitz, Bruno pronounces it \"Out-With\" and calls the F\u00fchrer \"the fury.\" Misconstruing the pronunciation of these words serves an underlying purpose other than Bruno's understanding. It's the misunderstanding leading to lack of common sense behind terms such as these that people make in trying to reach their ideal obtainable. The \"ends justify the means\" in other words, however horrific those steps are such as what the Nazi propaganda and thought exhibited. The book isn't without faults, even if the message is timely. The conclusion feels rushed and unfinished, and some of Bruno's own observations are greatly exaggerated, even for a nine year old.

So I wanted to find out what she meant. The most obvious similarity is that the main character in each book is a German boy who is caught up in the events of the Second World War.  Both books are simply written but effective and moving. Unlike my own book, Boyne\u2019s novel is completely unadorned. Yet it also captures the character\u2019s emotions and the situation he finds himself in. Even though the reading level is elementary, the narration draws you into the story. It doesn\u2019t need to be more complex because, with few words plainly written, he makes you care what happens to the characters.  Some reviewers have criticised Boyne\u2019s main character, Bruno, saying he is too na\u00efve for his age. Bruno may be an exaggeration of a sheltered, middle class child or he may be typical of a child raised in a more innocent era. But, either way, his naivety and his responses to events add poignancy to the story. His guileless viewpoint presents the concentration camp, where the story is set, in a stark manner. In my book, my main character, Erich, develops a greater awareness of the world around him than Bruno does but the story is told over a longer period. Bruno doesn\u2019t have a chance to learn and grow. Even though Bruno is young and na\u00efve, he develops a strong, caring friendship with Shmuel, a boy in the concentration camp. Friendship and human bonds are the book\u2019s central theme. Unnecessary details are pared away so that the friendship and interaction between the two boys stands out.  What struck me most about The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is the powerful ending. I was not expecting the turn the story took and was shocked when I reached the end.

(Maybedog)", "user_url": "/user/show/1059653-kelly-h-maybedog", "text": "Firstly, I want to start out by saying I get what Boyne is trying to do: talk about complicity and complacency and ignorance and how it still happens today. I agree it's an important message and I like that he attempted it, but I don't think he was as effective as he thinks he has been.I was disappointed in this book. I felt that what made it unique was the confusion about the time and place. Once that was clear, the continued mispronunciations felt contrived to me.I do think the text is well structured and I do think it has a good message about genocide, bigotry, and repeating historical horrors over and over again. The world was clear for the most part. I did have some problems with the book, and I am more than a little irritated with the author interview at the end (I listened to the audio version of this book.) The boy seemed extremely dense to me. Not just naive, but really, very stupid. I would have found it much more believable if we were talking about a 6 year old. Boyne makes a good point that the atrocities were not well known when they were happening and it took a long time for people to even believe something like that could happen. (To this day many people still don't believe it!) But this story takes place in 1943 when even a child living in Berlin would have to be completely blind to not notice that a lot of people were moving away. I can see that he might be sheltered and not know what was happening to them, but to be oblivious to the fact that something was happening when many of his classmates and neighbors would have disappeared, just doesn't ring true to me. In addition, as a wealthy child, he would be well aware of class: servants aren't the same as \"regular\" people and yet he expects Schmuel would be welcome in his house despite being dirty and obviously very poor at this point?Plus, I find it hard to believe that someone as high up in the Nazi party as his father wouldn't mention Jews and brainwash his children against them. Bruno has never even heard the word before. That makes no sense to me. The fact that he can't pronounce Fuhrer or Auschwitz is a little odd, too, given his age. (Never mind that the plays on words are based on someone who is speaking English--\"Out With\" which would not have the same meaning in German.) But putting that aside, assuming he really is pretty oblivious and goes to a surprisingly segregated school, once he starts talking to Schmuel he should have had an awakening. They talk every single day for a year and yet he doesn't get that Schmuel's life is horrible. What the hell did they talk about? Bruno knows enough to be scared of the Nazi soldier and deny knowing Schmuel but he then still talks about Schmuel coming to visit some day. By 10 years old he should know a prison outfit when he sees one, just from books and movies (which as a rich person he should have seen at points). My 16 year old who is in special ed and who is very ignorant listened to the last disk with me and, without knowing what the story was about or what was going on ahead of time, within a short time said, \"Is this about concentration camps?\" and kept saying, \"what a dumb-ass\" when he continued to not read perfectly obvious clues.What irritated me the most, though, was that in his interview, Boyne said that anyone who criticizes his work because they think Bruno is too naive is being offensive to the memory of the Holocaust and the survivors. Hunh? I can't find fault with particulars of his book without denying the Holocaust? That is offensive. He's not perfect. He didn't win the nobel prize for literature for this book. That's just so obnoxious. It is also not, despite his claims, the first book written from the perspective of a child of a Nazi. I can't remember the name of it but there was a book I read as a teen that did exactly that.Anyway, I do think this is an okay book. It was fairly enjoyable to read if you ignore the plot holes (a chain link fence with a hole big enough for a child to get through is not noticed by either the guards or adult survivors?) and the material is different from the standard.

Part of the reason I almost gave up reading this was because this was a March Group read for a group on goodreads. I have never done a group or buddy read for that matter, and I was under the impression that we had to be at the same point in the book at the same time.The other and more embarrassing reason being that I thought because I had seen the movie that reading this could wait. I was sadly mistaken. I loved the movie but there were a lot of differences in the content and obviously the writing that I would have missed out on. When I finished reading the story I re-watched the movie. In comparison now, the movie looks like a bunch of scenes stitched together with less flow. It also felt rushed. I will give the movie this, the one scene that always crushes me is when we are first introduced to the boy in the striped pyjamas. I didn't get the same reaction when I read it. It's still heart wrenching, but I feel it more when I see the kid on the big screen.This is the story of an unusual friendship between two boys, one German and one Jewish during World War II.We begin with 9-year-old Bruno coming home and finding out that his whole family is moving because his absent father has a new job. He hates his new house because it only has three floors and it doesn\u2019t have a banister for him to slide down on. He believes that his father must not be very good as his job if they made him move to such an awful place. He believes that all he has to do is voice his displeasure and they can all pack up and go back home.Bruno was overly protected by his mother and other adults and he wasn't told where they were or what his father's job entailed. His perspective of what was going on was na\u00efve and immature.When he meets the boy in the striped pyjamas, Shmuel, he has no idea why Shmuel lives behind the fence. This is where the lack of maturity is the strongest. There is nothing inviting about the fence. Everything about it screams cage or prison. Yet to Bruno it's just something that's in the way. Bruno invites him to dinner and makes plans to have him over for the holidays when \u201cthis is over\u201d.This is where I come to the story and I have to pause for a minute. Two thoughts follow me for the rest of the story. Firstly, I know this is a fictionalized story about these two boys but I can not help but think that Shmuel represents countless other boys whose stories will remain unheard. Somewhere deep down inside where my feelings aren't so easily described in words, I believe that if this had been a story of just this one boy, that this was a gross error in one of the most horrific events in our lifetime, and just this one boy was hurt, that maybe we could wrap our head around it and for the lack of a better phrase, not hurt so much. Sadly there were more Shmuels and this is a thought that I cannot shake.I love the way the story is told from Bruno's perspective and how his innocence and the common sense of a 9-year-old frame his observations. Even though they are both the same age, Shmuel appears to be the more mature boy of the two. The second thought that follows me - Is this such a bad thing? That Bruno is ignorant of what's going on? What's the alternative? That at a young age his parents should have sat him down and explained to him why they kill Jews?I cannot imagine anyone getting to the last few chapters and putting the book down. It's more likely that you'll call in late to work or take public transportation instead of driving.Recommended even if you've watched the film. They are different enough to warrant reading this emotionally manipulative fable*.*This is a Get Out Of Jail Free Card for historically inaccurate pieces of fiction.P.S.

However, despite the simplicity, this does not mask in any way the sheer horror and importance of the moral of the story.This story is so, so important. It's almost to the point of being unbelievable that many things mentioned in the book, actually physically happened or existed. For instance, concentration camps.

His family leaves Berlin to move to the country because his father has been reassigned by the \"Fury.\" Bruno's youth and innocence has protected him from the harsh realities of Hilter and his reign of terror. Life in the country is dull and boring for Bruno. He doesn't understand his new home, \"Out-With.\" He's left his friends behind and doesn't like the smaller house he's forced to live in with his parents and his sister. Missing the hustle and bustle of the city, Bruno begins to explore his new surroundings. Beyond the fence near his house, he sees people, but is confused by their strange striped pajamas and their sad demeanor. Bruno's loneliness is somewhat relieved when he becomes friends with a boy on the other side of the fence. They meet daily and exchange comments about their daily lives, but neither fully understands the circumstances of the other. Boyne presents a story about the Holocaust like none other before.

I have not had the best of luck reading books in a child's point of view, but I really liked this one because it was written in third person. It was easier to read, the language was a bit more complicated and I just appreciated having a mediator between me and Bruno.My first issue came with the writing, but not the way the book is written. I found it to be unbelievable at times. You have a little boy who says things like \"she was a hopeless case\" and \"it was touch and go for a little while\" who can't seem to be able to pronounce Fuhrer and Auschwitz. He uses Fury and Out-with. And ok, I get it. But it was kind of disrespectful almost to me. Like this kid is clearly not unable to talk because if a 9 year old ever said \"it was touch and go\" to me, they can say Auschwitz and Fuhrer. So I just didn't get this. My second issue is with Bruno himself. Now, I am not a kid person. I was never surrounded by kids. I've done very minor amounts of babysitting, no one in my family is younger than me, I am the kid. So I just don't have a lot of patience for kids. But Bruno tried on what little patience I have. He was so conceited. I don't know if kids are always this selfish and self-absorbed, but when a VERY skinny sad looking kid on the other side of a fence is talking to me about why he's there sitting in Pyjamas, I would like to know what's going on. When I hear \"we were taken from our house\" my first impulse is not to go ME TOO and go on about how my life sucks. Sure, I'm not 9, but I feel like Bruno was meant to be smart, but then not. But again, I am not sure if this is typical child behaviour so I can't really comment either way (which is why I upped the stars from 3 to 4, can't take away stars for not getting it).Third issue, this one is minor, but affects my overall enjoyment, and that's me wondering what the point was? Like yeah it's a good book but I don't really consider this groundbreaking, nor would I consider this Holocaust literature. For starters, you don't really get a German view of the war/Holocaust, if that's what was trying to be portrayed here. You also don't get a Jewish view of the war/Holocaust. As I've said before about books, I study the Holocaust so I'm picky. But since this wasn't Holocaust lit, I enjoyed it. There's just nothing there. No \"point\". It's a children's book that doesn't teach children anything. What it DOES do though is it gets children to ask questions. If I was 9-13 and I read this I would probably go to my mom and start asking questions and for that I do enjoy this book because it will spread second hand awareness.I did enjoy some things about the book though. The writing was easy. I liked the language and everything. I really loved knowing what's going on even though the boy didn't. I felt the innocence of him and I can only imagine what he might have said in the future about this experience.. you know.. if he could.I also appreciated that both boys had the same exact date of birth. I feel like this was a small glossed over part, but probably the most important feature of the book. These are 2 little boys, born on the exact same day but in 2 very different worlds. They are essentially identical, except one of the them is living a life of luxury and one of them is living a life of misery. (view spoiler)[And in the end, both of them die the same way. It just shows that while you may be born into a certain life, there is no racism in death (hide spoiler)]I will admit, I watched this movie when it came out a long time ago so the ending did not pack the punch it might have had. And honestly, the movie did it a bit better. I appreciated the abruptness of the movie ending and the dawning realization that happens and the fact that the movie ends minutes after, not months/years after like the book. But really, the end is \"great\" either way.Another non-related thing in this review that has no impact on my reading: I read the interview with the author at the end and I 10000000% disagree with him saying that German's had no idea what was going on. You live less than 1km away from Auschwitz, you know what's happening. I appreciated that the movie made this obvious.

The story is very difficult to read, not because it is badly written but simply it is because it is horror through the eyes of young children who simply don't understand. I don't want to spoil anything but if I am being honest the last 15 pages were sheer agony to read. I was terrified for both boys and I had a feeling of how it will end. I didn't cry simply because when it comes to the Holocaust and the true horrors that occurred between 1939 to 1945 there are simply no tears enough to shed and no words to describe the evil. The only criticism that I have (and I am seriously nit picking here) is the correct spelling of Krak\u00f3w. In the book it was spelt Cracow which if you are a Polish speaker (which I am) it is slightly irritating.All in all this book is powerful, highly emotional, historically correct and is something that the reader will never ever forget. 5/5", "num_likes": 20, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["sad", "young-adult", "historical-fiction", "war", "adult"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/24780202", "review_id": "24780202", "date": "Jun 18, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Ceci", "user_url": "/user/show/732970-ceci", "text": "I think this is a wonderful book.

At times, the narrative is almost like poetry, with the many ellipses and phrases that are repeated over and over again. I also believe that this is an important book for the German descendants of the Nazi commandants... many hold them responsible for the sins of their fathers, when a mere child could do very little. I value this book and its message a lot more than for instance St. Ex's pretentious Little Prince. This one is true, on a fundamental level... and it opens a door to compassion... we are all the same, no matter what our age, sex, nationality... All of us shaved bald and in striped pyjamas, we'd be nothing but prey to those who want to exclude all that is different. It makes one ask where one puts up the fences, and why.

There's most definitely a moral to the story and a valuable one at that.

This is a topic fraught with emotion and I totally get why people would interpret this book as flip. But when I put it into context of being a children's book, I appreciate that Boyne's discussing a horrific time in world history in a way that's not overtly didactic or preachy for his target demographic. In so doing, he's potentially opening it up for discussion so (a) kids learn about the holocaust/world history and (b) are therefore more attuned to recognizing the telltale signs of it happening again which, hopefully, would parlay into being more vocal in calling attention to it whether it be Kosovo, Rwanda or Chechnya.While I did enjoy it, it didn't consume me like The Boy at the Top of the Mountain or A Ladder to the Sky.

Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t enjoy The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and I know how awful it feels when someone does not like a book you recommended.Since August, I\u2019ve decided to rate books more critically. These two stars don\u2019t mean that this novel was awful. It merely means that I thought it was okay, though there were a number of things that bothered me.I wasn\u2019t a fan of the writing style right from the start. Though the protagonist is only nine years old, this is not a middle grade book. Still, it\u2019s written in a juvenile way: the sentences are very long and lack punctuation, just like a child would speak. This is merely my own preference, but I do not enjoy to read sentences build like that.Furthermore, I don\u2019t really understand what the author was trying to achieve with this book. It\u2019s not at all educational. Bruno refers to Hitler by saying The Fury instead of F\u00fchrer, continues to say Outwith instead of Auschwitz, even though he has been corrected multiple times, German words are never used\u2026 Nor did it show us the true horrors of the concentration camps. After all, the entire novel is told from Bruno\u2019s point of view, who remains clueless until the very end.And that\u2019s probably what I disliked about The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas most: Bruno didn\u2019t go through any character development. I\u2019m very well aware that he is a child, but after talking for over a year to Schmuel, he still has no idea how difficult his friend\u2019s situation is. All they can do is talk to each other, yet he still doesn\u2019t realize what is going on. Yes, he\u2019s only a child, but there has to be a limit to ignorance. Bruno\u2019s father was a proud Nazi, so I find it very difficult to believe he never talked about Hitler, Jewish people\u2026 at home. On top of that, they had Hitler over for dinner one night! Who would risk their child saying something \u2018stupid\u2019 then? No, that\u2019s impossible. Bruno grew up around Nazi-soldiers and near Auschwitz, he must have noticed what was going on. I mean, the kid didn\u2019t even know what the word \u2018Jew\u2019 meant! While many might argue that Bruno is the epitome of innocence, I\u2019d call him ignorant instead.Which brings me to the many plot holes. Not to mention how convenient everything was. There were over a million prisoners in Auschwitz, yet Bruno manages to meet someone who was born on the exact same day as him. Bruno knows that the lieutenant shot a dog, yet when people are murdered, he thinks they\u2019re just lying on the ground. The place where Bruno and Schmuel meet, is never once guarded by soldiers. Furthermore, in over one year, they\u2019re never discovered, even though they met almost daily. These camps were not recreational resorts. Children were either murdered or used as labourers. How did no one notice that Schmuel was gone most days? Sure, it\u2019s difficult to keep track of millions of people, but it\u2019s still highly unlikely that this could\u2019ve happened. Before I read this, I knew Bruno was going to meet a Jewish boy, imprisoned in a concentration camp. To my surprise though, it took quite a while before those two characters met. By then, I was already annoyed with Bruno\u2019s ignorance and was longing for some character development. Ultimately, that didn\u2019t even happen. Clearly, I didn\u2019t like much about this novel. It just bothers me that this story is told from the point of view of someone who is privileged. To make things worse, he never even realizes how lucky he is. I am convinced I would\u2019ve enjoyed this more if it were written from Schmuel\u2019s POV. Still, there would\u2019ve been a lot of plot holes. I might be wrong (I\u2019m in no way implying to be a World War II expert), but how does one, who has been in a concentration camp for over a year, not realize that those who suddenly disappear, were murdered? Finally, I want to discuss the ending. Once again, I am no expert, but I find it very unlikely that that could ever happen. (view spoiler)[The people imprisoned were mainly used for labour. Why would they decide to murder a random group of people? Sure, the Nazis wanted them dead, but they wanted to profit from them as well. Do not forget that Bruno was a healthy boy. There were probably other people in that group who could\u2019ve been \u2018useful\u2019 too. I am aware of how horrible this sounds, but those times were horrifying. These soldiers were not compassionate and would\u2019ve made anyone work until they dropped dead. I don\u2019t know, I think there was a system behind who they put in the gas chamber, instead of choosing random groups. (hide spoiler)]Having said all of this, I still want to watch the movie adaptation. I think I\u2019m going to enjoy that more, since we won\u2019t be inside Bruno\u2019s head as much.Conclusion: Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t enjoy The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. I didn\u2019t like the writing style, thought there were a lot of plot holes and conveniences and longed for character development.", "num_likes": 17, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["read-in-2016", "historical-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3430706573", "review_id": "3430706573", "date": "Apr 21, 2021", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Maria Wheeler", "user_url": "/user/show/114861083-maria-wheeler", "text": " \u201cWhat exactly was the difference?

Right from the synopsis of the book to the way the author held back from revealing too much to keep the reader guessing and how the author concluded the book, it's truly a work of a masterpiece. The book follows Bruno and his family who move from Berlin to this place that is situated right next to a camp known as Out-With. The boy, Bruno, moves from a place that was beaming with life to a home that is literally grey and sad. He hates his new home and has absolutely no friends at all. A kid his age needs friends to get his time going. His parents are fortunate and have maids and cooks in the house that treat his family with royalty. Bruno believes that his father is doing the right thing in his job even after countless moments of eavesdropping in which he finds out some truth to the matter and also the stories from the workers in his house. I especially loved the back stories of the maid and the cook where they revealed their actual profession prior to their current demeaning job. After much boredom, Bruno finally decides to explore his new home and ventures towards the camp site that is located in his line of view from his bedroom window. Here, he meets a boy that shares the same birth date and age as him and they grow to becoming the best of friends. The highlight in this book is definitely the author's writing style. It was magnificent and I enjoyed it. This book was read within a sitting and it was so easy to read this. The story was great and engaged me throughout.

And I'm actually really curious to know what middle grade kids would make of it, because the majority of them probably wouldn't have the background knowledge to understand what Bruno's talking about when he says that the Fury came to dinner or that he's moving to OutWith. Adults can translate that instinctively, and will likely suffer the same rising sense of dread that I had throughout the second half of the story. But middle graders? I'm not so sure. ANYWAY. This book is the story of nine year old Bruno, who is forced to move away from his home in Berlin because his father has a new job that means lots of soldiers report to him and he has to wear a shiny uniform every day. Their new house is right next door to this really big town of really tiny houses where everyone wears funny hats and stripy pyjamas all the time. Bruno thinks it's pretty cool that they get to wear pyjamas all day, but he doesn't understand why he can't go and play with the boys who live on the other side of the fence. As an adult, Bruno's incredible naivety is both heartbreaking and \"OMG HOW ARE YOU SO BLIND\" inducing. But, like, the kid is nine. Ask half the nine year olds in Australia what the Prime Minister does and they'd probably have no idea. They certainly wouldn't have enough awareness of the world to understand why they were being told to stay away from people who wore stripy pyjamas and yellow star armbands. The last few chapters were particularly heartbreaking and \"Ohgod, sweet boy, no no no no no\" worthy. Where it lost a star for me is that it took about half the book for Bruno to stop whining about the fact that he no longer lives in Berlin and to start exploring the world around him at \"OutWith\".

I could not even bring myself to turn the next last pages. I would not have cared if I had violated one of my rules that I should finish a book no matter how disappointing or revolting it turns out to be. Just I could not withstand seeing what is going to happen next and my heart crying over another ending with which I would be overwhelmed, but I did not want to give in. This was it. Why should I back off? Face whatever the next story is.Its catchy title written in striped -pyjamas book cover is enchanting enough for a reader like me to pick it out from among the other PDFs saved in my phone document. (As you know, I am a poor reader. I avail of the free PDFs available on the internet.) Somewhow, I enjoyed reading the book because the prose is light, the scenes are engaging despite that they are the keys to the predictable segue, the main character Bruno is the embodiment of my childhood curiosity, and the story is very unique, something I have never read from the other fictions. However, although I may not be a full-fledged writer, I may consider myself climbing on the bandwagon of the armchair writers that it is poor-written, one of the shortcomings that may have let down their high standards.For me, this is just a light book; it is imbued with ponderous prose. It does not have any hefty words your brains have to weigh in on or cerebrally hemorrhagic sentence structures you have to turn over in your mind (as what a grammar Nazi does.) You can concentrate on it no matter how simple the syntax is except for shrinking from the simplicity and shiftlessness of some sentences John Doyne may not have cared about embellishing them more.Also, you might find yourself deeply engaged in it because Bruno is such a pig-headed wren. His character is the lubricant of the story. His being a pain in the ass soothes the story to become more calmly enthralling. However, there were times that I would trip over some parts only experienced and critically acclaimed writers have to know what I am trying to drive at. DON'T GET ME WRONG.. I BELONG TO THE ARMCHAIR WRITERS.In addition, you would not just be a reader but a soothsayer. You could almost play in your mind the foretaste of the unexpected. I was wondering if it was John Doyne, not his readers, was (not) born yesterday. In the first place, I had inferred that Bruno will die at the end because his buttoned-up and power monger father will not educate him about the concentration camp Bruno will mistake for a farm. (Oh, poor Bruno. His father\u2019s ignorance of a child\u2019s psyche will accidentally put him to death. Lo and behold, I have read such a tragic ending from the other books. (Thinking) \u2026 (Walking back and forth)\u2026 (Thinking)\u2026 Eureka! I'm Not Scared by Italian writer Niccol\u00f2 Ammaniti must be one of them. So, it\u2019s another meme of the same idea. Could you help me cite some more?)In effect, the concept of the story brushing off all the shortcomings that did not meet the high standards of the armchair writers is supposed to be impressive. I bought some Doyne\u2019s \u201cliterary gimmicks\u201d First, Bruno\u2019s \u201cstupid or idiotic \u201cinnocence. I admit to cringing at it because I knew that Bruno was not that stupid enough not to understand everything in the story given that he is two years younger than his sister. A reader ignorant of child psychology may ask this,\u201d Is there such a cognitive condition?\u201d Second, the deep friendship between the two boys developed at a barbed boundary. It is something new for me. Third, to make the commonly accidental tragedy memorable, the scene is both Bruno and Shmuel are stuck in a line toward the gas chamber. Finally, unbeknownst to Bruno\u2019s family, he will die in the gas chamber and his loss will remain a mystery. So, after reading the book, I sat speechlessly, imagining the chamber fading away, and I could no longer hear the cries muffled by the gas poured in. Heart-breaking! Indeed, it is a story readers might never forget.Writers have drops of ideas plopping in their heads, but the big challenge for them is how to creatively put them together with beautiful prose. By the same token, they have to psychologize the possible reactions of their readers because nowadays readers are smart. They are now being educated by full access to a plethora of information on the internet. For this reason, John Doyne should have needed more elbow grease to polish the story. It could most likely get more than two stars. (Gee! Indeed, I am an armchair writer. )I have just found its movie adaptation on YouTube.

If something bothers me it will usually nag at me for the entire story, regardless of its merits. I also tend to be quite literal, so arguments of metaphor won't quite do it for me. That being said, if my reasons for disliking this book seem flimsy to you, you were warned. The biggest issue I had with this book was the sheer mis-classification of age. I have spent the last few years working with 9 & 10 year olds, and I can assure you they are about 1000x more intelligent than this supposed 9-year old protagonist, Bruno. The sister, Gretel, also suffered from this, but as she is not the focus of the book she didn't bother me quite as much. Had the characters been written as 6 and 9, respectively, I may have had an easier time understanding why Bruno was SO STUPID. Then we have the language. I did listen to an interview with the author in which he speaks about the book as a book for all ages. So I understand that some of the language quirks were intentional in order to reach the widest audience. However, I can't accept the English idioms used as misunderstandings of German words. Auschwitz is referred to as \"out with\" by Bruno throughout the book. I'm sorry, a German child is not going to confuse a German word with an English phrase. Just no. He also misunderstands the meaning of \"heil\" as in \"heil Hitler\" to mean goodbye, even though, again, HE SPEAKS GERMAN. His father is an officer and his son apparently doesn't know who the Fuhrer is; he refers to him as \"the fury\" throughout the book. UGH.Additionally, Bruno is just. so. naive. He lives directly aside Auschwitz for a year and still spends ample time being jealous of Shmuel for having so many friends to play with while he has none. He witnesses the brutal treatment of his Jewish friend and his utter starvation, his father (who is a Commandant, I might add) tells him the people in the camp are \"not people at all\", there are soldiers and fences surrounding the area, and yet Bruno makes no connections as to the horrific nature of the camp he is living next to. Then we have the incredibly selfish nature of Bruno himself. He has absolutely no compassion whatsoever, and I came to despise him and his treatment of his \"friend\" Shmuel. He is constantly making thoughtless comments and eating the food he carries to the starving boy during his visits because he just gets so hungry  on the walk to the camp. Speaking of the camp. There is no way a young boy in a concentration camp could have disappeared to sit by the fence every day without a guard noticing. (view spoiler)[ A fence, I might add, that can be easily lifted for a child to crawl under. And then we have the manner of Bruno's death. Even if I bought into his complete lack of understanding, Shmuel would have understood. He would have known that Bruno would be in extreme danger inside the camp, and that he would not be able to leave it once he had entered.

And this was largely due to the fact that, as many reviewers before me have pointed out, there is a lot about this book that doesn't quite make sense, that doesn't quite work.The main complaint is that Bruno is way too naive for a 9/10 year-old, that it's completely implausible that he could live at Auschwitz and not know the first thing about the camp, or why people wear striped pajamas, or that his friend is clearly famished and suffering and that they obviously don't play over there. Yes, certain sentences are a bit cringy. (view spoiler)[ Like when Bruno asks Schmuel why he never changes his clothes and must get tired of wearing stripes? I mean????  (hide spoiler)]. Yes, there is overall a sense of implausibility hanging over the story, despite that it's obviously grounded in true events. My main issue was the length of time the book spans.  I was ready to accept that, at nine years old, Bruno is wholly innocent of what goes on right outside his door, that he doesn't really know who Jews are, that he doesn't understand the situation he's in. That's fine, but only up to a point. That works for a few weeks, a month or two at most. But a whole year??? We're supposed to believe that he secretly meets with a Jewish boy at the same spot at the same time everyday for a YEAR and no one finds out?? That after a whole year, he STILL doesn't know that \"the people in the striped pajamas\" are prisoners??? I can understand a boy of his age not understanding the situation completely, but wouldn't he at least question things a bit more? He's supposed to be fond of exploring, and yet doesn't think to ask his friend ANYTHING about his situation, not even \"how come you're not allowed on my side of the fence?\"And it supposedly lasts a full year?? Don't get me wrong, I did like this book. It's kinda impossible no to. Because for all its implausibility, Bruno still had a way of worming his way into your heart, and his friendship with Schmuel was one of the purest, most heartbreaking things ever, but the level of suspension of disbelief required in too many scenes really took away from the poignancy of the story. The ending will still hit you like a brick, but it doesn't feel as real as it should have.

I go into these books expecting to be heartbroken and this book disappointed. The book is only 216 pages which I felt was too short to tell a good story. This story centers around Bruno, 9, and his family who live in Berlin and have to move to a home outside of Auschwitz. Bruno and his sister, Gretel, have a great life in Berlin: a large home, house servants, friends, grandparents nearby. All this changes when Hitler, The Fuhrer, comes to dinner and Bruno's father is promoted to commandant and required to move to the home outside of Auschwitz. Bruno and Gretel have to move away from their large home, their nice neighborhood and bustling city of Berlin to rural Poland, a smaller house and no kids their age around. Once they have moved to the new home, Bruno can see outside his window barbed wire fencing and small homes and people, including children, in striped pajamas, but he has no idea why they are there.Earlier I mentioned that Bruno is 9 and is the son of the commandant to Hitler, but somehow he is OBLIVIOUS to everything going on around him. He doesn't know what's going on with Jews and he doesn't even know that he isn't a Jew. He continues to pronounce The Fuhrer as \"The Fury\" and Auschwitz as \"Out-With\". Come on now, how does this make sense. They are in Germany SPEAKING GERMAN, but he calls it Out-With?! How SWAY?! He is constantly corrected by his parents and his sister but still can't say it correctly. He is NINE, not 6, not 5, not 4. He is NINE and I refuse to believe a nine year old in Berlin wouldn't know how to pronounce either one.Continuing on with age, like I said Bruno is 9 and Gretel is 12. But they act like 5 and 7 at best. She is a brat and just cares about her damn dolls and then eventually has a crush on one of her father's soldiers (which is the only time she acts her age). She obviously knows what is going on and tries to explain to her brother but he obviously doesn't absorb any of it. Also, I have many WWII historical fiction books and there were many youth programs in Nazi Germany to make sure the youth knew what was happening. Again, for Bruno to be so ignorant is not believable to me. Another issue is that the majority of this short book is just about Bruno whining about missing his house and his friends. Fine, I get it, moving at 9 sucks no matter where you're from, but don't sell this as a WWII, Holocaust story and mostly focus on the privileged brat from Berlin. Once he finally meets Shmuel, 'the boy in the striped pajamas', Bruno's level of ignorance and stupidity increases. I can't even stand it. He constantly complains to Shmuel, WHO IS IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP, that he doesn't have any friends and he is lonely. That Shmuel is lucky because he has friends and gets to play. Keep in mind, they are separated by a barbed wire fence, he can see that Shmuel is skin and bones, dirty, downtrodden. Shmuel tells him that they don't get to play, he doesn't have friends, he is always hungry. But good ole oblivious Bruno is still a jealous brat. I CANNOT WITH THIS BOOK.The ending is cheap. The entire book is basically Bruno walking through his privileged life as a spoiled brat who complains about everything and then he meets a boy and now he has a friend. If you've seen the movie, you know how it ends. It's literally the last chapter . Is it sad, yes. But it was CHEAP. The author didn't spend enough time researching in order to bring the reader an authentic story. It was rushed, it was not well thought out and it is probably the worst Holocaust/WWII book I've read.

And the view from his window is a death camp, but Bruno of course does not understand that.

There, behind the fence, he finds another boy, Shmuel, very similar to him, just much thinner, and he, like the rest of these people behind the fence, wears a striped pajamasBruno is slowly finding out more and more about the camps outside his window. His friendship with Shmuel gets stronger each day, even though they can't really play together, just talk. He learns about the hunger, the beating, the fear, the fact that their life is nothing that he, in his very protected life, can even imagine. It is between funny and heart breaking when he finds the similarities between him and Shmuel: both were made leaving their home to move to \"Out With\" (Auschwitz), both came on a train, both are surrounded by armbands with a symbol. What exactly was the difference? he wondered to himself. And who decided which people wore the striped pajamas and which people wore the uniforms?. Bruno is so naive and so adorable.

So we see two innocent boys--too young to have learned about hating others--sitting on opposite sides of a barbed wire fence becoming friends. The ending is quite disturbing.I did find it difficult to believe that Bruno would be able to pay almost daily visits to Shmuel considering that there would be guards patrolling the fences. Bruno had also never heard about Jews, although he had just moved from Berlin where they would have had yellow stars sewn on their clothes and he lived in a military home.What is the target audience for this book? I could see kids reading the book in their early teens if the Holocaust and genocide were discussed in a classroom or with their parents so they learned about the actual history. (The book was labeled a fable, and never mentioned the words Holocaust or Auschwitz since the author also wanted the readers to think about other camps and other genocides.) Although the book was emotionally moving, it was too simple and sanitized for adult reading if one considers the actual horrors of the concentration camps.

Didn't the author, John Boyne, think that readers might be able to understand that Auschwitz, when spoken in the German language Boyne told us several times was being spoken, doesn't even come close to sounding like like \"Out-With?\" Same with Furher and \"Fury.\" I think he may have been trying too hard to be clever and the result is more distracting than anything, not to mention confusing to the young audience he's supposedly writing for, as the correct titles are rarely used. I think it has a place in young adult literature. It narrates the disconnect between the world of a privileged Nazi family and the horrors of the concentration camp with the sensitivity required for young, innocent readers. It's not really Holocaust light, but it is definitely Holocaust junior. Because of this, I was less jolted by the predictably tragic ending than I probably should have been.

The novel follows Bruno and his family as they move from a secure and wealthy life in Berlin to the forlorn and desolate Polish countryside where his SS Officer father has been promoted to commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp. Bruno, who wants to be an explorer, is immediately curious when he sees a 'farm' out of his bedroom window. However, he is forbidden from investigating further by his mother, who is well aware of who the 'strange' children are that Bruno wishes to play with. Of course, being a precocious eight-year-old, Bruno ignores her and ventures through the woods where he comes across Schmuel, an eight-year-old Jewish boy, with whom he forms an intense friendship that is not hindered by racial prejudices and hatred, despite many attempts by Bruno's anti-Semitic tutor to convince him otherwise. The dramatic climax to this heart wrenching tale is nothing short of amazing and will leave audiences both astounded and devastated. Bruno, being eight, has a very innocent and naive perception of the world; however, throughout the novel after many short, but poignant exchanges with Schmuel and Paval, Bruno begins to understand more about the world around him and his innocent view begins to change. Bruno is lied to by many people in his life and in a way Schmuel is one of them. He has already faced some of life's harshest realities, and in some ways protects Bruno from having to confront these issues. Although, there are still many occasions where Bruno portrays his innocence and does not seem to comprehend the severity of Schmuel\u2019s situation. As the novel is centred around Bruno\u2019s subjective view of the world there are many events which take place that he may not observe or comprehend. In some cases this limits what can be said and what must be implied to the audience. Sometimes Bruno\u2019s information can be wrong; it is up to the audience to work this out. This invites the audience to feel sympathy for Bruno, Schmuel, Paval and Bruno\u2019s mother who are all, along with millions of others, victims of one of the darkest and most brutal times in human history. Bruno\u2019s world is filled with secrets and lies; he is lied to by his parents who are lying to each other and, most of all, to themselves. Bruno\u2019s father is forced to keep secret the real purpose of the camp and Bruno\u2019s mother seems to be unaware, or unwilling to admit to herself, what is actually happening at the camp. (view spoiler)[His parent\u2019s deceit ultimately leads to Bruno\u2019s death; forcing his father to face reality and destroying his, already distraught, mother. (hide spoiler)] The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas is a masterpiece; it is gripping, heartbreaking and teaches audiences that sometimes the things that divide us can also unite us.

( I don't know if I'm describing this in a way you guy's will understand but I think you's will get what I mean ;) ) and to me this gives an incredibly rare but such a convincing narrative and an almost ethereal feeling to it of a young child's viewpoint/thought process. Boyne even goes to portray in the novel how Bruno would incorrectly spell words i.e. Fuhrer and Auschwitz etc just like many young children do! I truly believe it's in the little details like this how John Boyne has created such a masterpiece in this novel! Paying attention to the finer things, the things many people wouldn't think of perhaps, wouldn't even consider if it wasn't there but makes it all the more special because of it's inclusion in the book.Of course this book is touching on a very harrowing and raw subject yet it is done in an expertly manner, even though it is not heavy loaded with factual information or written in a more adult like manner he manages to write a book that can cover all age groups, while keeping and including the factual historical info, the treatment of the prisoners of war in these POW camps, the brutality and cruelty they endured, to most telling as the title suggests when he made a new friend and as we know children when there very young don't see the 'differences' between us whether it's race, religion, sexual orientation or maybe even a physical disability and it's only as they grow up and society's 'norms' are put upon us to just always accept these things as the right way even if it really isn't! (anyway back on subject :) yet his new friend just happened to be a POW and it didn't matter to either of them they were on opposite sides of the fence, opposite countries, fighting in this war they knew nothing about, it was just stripped right back to the two young boys feeling sad and alone for their own reasons coming together and creating a friendship, it is just such a beautiful poignant moment in the book, (although it's not it's only one ;).) I don't know if you can ever describe a book that's not a typical love story beautiful but that's the word that comes to mind when describing this book and it's story. It is an important story to tell, and one relatable to thousands of people, of all ages yet it has a uniqueness all it's own and while it's about a sad devastating event in our history it isn't always sad either, there is happy moments, moments that make you smile.

I read the audiobook of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and it captured my imagination from the start. At the end of the audiobook is an interview between the author and the editor, which was intriguing and edifying. They hit upon so many of the topics I thought about while reading. For example, whether the book is a children\u2019s book (the narrator, Michael Maloney, definitely read it as if it was directed to children, which I liked at times and found a bit annoying at others; it made me wonder if the author had this intention or if it was the narrator\u2019s affect), a young adult\u2019s book or an adult\u2019s book. In the interview, John Boyne answers this query with, \u201cit\u2019s a book\u201d. Another question was, is it at all likely that what happened, in the way it happened, could have reasonably happened? The answer was that it\u2019s a novel, really a fable. There are lessons to be learned, questions to be asked, extremely strong feelings to be felt. These are the things to be taken from the story without worrying about in which section of the bookshop it should be shelved. It says on the back cover of the audiobook, \u201cWe think it is important that you start to listen without knowing what it\u2019s about\u201d. I agree and have thus not tried to summarize the book. The title, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, does of course evoke the general subject matter. Perhaps I should not have been, but I was surprised to find this Irish author write so credibly and so profoundly about the Holocaust. It was also incredibly satisfying that Boyne was able to tell the story believably through the eyes and voice of this eight year old boy, Bruno. Boyd captured Bruno\u2019s world view and most importantly, his innocence as he found himself living right in the heart of a time period that only in retrospect would be known as one of the most horrifying time periods of history.

Not all children could be expected to understand what's going on - especially if their parents raised them in a bubble and never allowed them to know of anything other than their own little world.

Why did I willingly put myself through that? Wowza. Basically little German boy\u2019s daddy is a soldier. They are moved into a home literally next door to Auschwitz. Bruno is a sweet boy, kind, albeit tragically naive. There is a fence. On the other side of this fence there are people. Shoeless people with grey colorless faces, buzzed haircuts and striped \u201cpajamas.\u201d Bruno finds himself playing along the fence, where he meets his friend Shmuel. Shmuel is another little boy seemingly just like himself. Only he isn\u2019t, not really. But in both his innocence and unwillingness to look closely, Bruno doesn\u2019t see this. But they meet along the fence every day and they talk. Bruno comments on how despite the fact that they are best friends, they have an unusual relationship because they have never played together. They\u2019ve only sat, and talked. Bruno\u2019s innocence is charming in a way, as childlike innocence can be, but the juxtaposition is that at times it also feels selfish, even cruel. Of course I knew the ending would be heartbreaking, this is WWII after all which is pretty much synonymous with heartbreak, but Boyne definitely threw me a curve ball that came straight for me & knocked the wind right outta me because that ending was even more brutal than I had prepared myself for. (*Spoiler* and not because it was one over the other, the German boy over the Jew, as critics imply was done intentionally, but because it was BOTH of them.)I guess I should\u2019ve known what I was getting myself into, I knew I was picking up a WWII book, but I also knew it was John Boyne doing the writing and so far my experience with him has been that his book managed to pack in the stark realities of life without being gratuitously tragic. His other book, My Heart\u2019s Invisible Furies was compared a lot to A Little Life, which I understood but didn\u2019t agree with. A Little Life was the very epitome of gratuitous violence and devastation, whereas Hearts Invisible Furies was devastating, but hopeful. And such is life, right? So when I picked up \u2018Boy in the Striped Pajamas\u2019 I expected something along those lines. Plus I knew it wasn\u2019t an especially long book, so how much heartbreak can Boyne possibly squeeze into this? Well. A shitload, that\u2019s how much. I kept wondering what possessed John Boyne to write this story. Like why did he have this story in him? Where did it come from? Hearts Invisible Furies, I get it. He birthed that book from his experiences. He was/is a gay man living in conservative Northern Ireland. So I kept wanting to think that TBITSP was another book that came from within him, that meant something to him and wasn\u2019t just some exploitative cheap and easy grab at the low hanging fruit, another author going for the sure thing with concentration camps and CHILDREN of all things, & while doing some digging I did unearth a whiff of controversy. Apparently the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum tweeted that TBWTSP is to be avoided by those seeking an accurate understanding of Auschwitz and the Holocaust. Boyne tweeted back, defended his book & argued & all that but without delving much further into it I have to say that it feels safe to choose to believe the museum on this one. SPOILERSOne of the biggest criticisms of the book was that it seemingly was telling the reader to care about the story only because it happened to someone like you, when it shouldn\u2019t take that for us to care. Meaning pretty much that when Bruno the German, non-Jew was mistaken as a Jew, it allowed all us evil racist readers who don\u2019t care about the Jew children getting cooked in camps to suddenly start caring, because now it was one of us, tho in actuality we should care regardless. We should\u2019ve cared when it was just gonna be Shmuel. Or so the critics say.Ok so there\u2019s so many things that baffle me about that outlook...because first of all who wasn\u2019t caring? I think every single person who picked up this book had a heart that was already breaking for Shmuel from page 1, & the loss of Bruno was no more or no less tragic than the loss of Shmuel. The tragedy of it was not that he was a German boy that got killed, nor that it could\u2019ve or should\u2019ve been avoided because all those deaths should\u2019ve been avoided, but rather in the innocent, kind, child\u2019s intentions that led Bruno to his fate. In some ways I am able to grasp the notion that by telling Bruno\u2019s story, it could potentially take away from the real stories of any of the millions of Jews that died at the time. Like why tell this story about this German child when there are already millions of faceless Jewish children whose stories are just waiting to be told? But in the end I just choose not to look at things like that. Because this wasn\u2019t just Bruno\u2019s story, it was Shmuel\u2019s too, & the presence of a non Jew in this story, even making him the MC could not overshadow the sheer enormity of what we as a reader know is happening, even as Bruno himself is unaware. The war and it\u2019s atrocities take center stage here, it is the huge looming villain in any story that takes place during WWII, & our characters are simply the fictional instruments with which we connect more personally to the story. People are upset that Boyne chose a non Jew as the device with which to relay a Holocaust story. But then there\u2019s instances like with American Dirt where the author gets criticism for being a white woman writing about Mexican characters. John Boyne himself is a white man. So is it ok or isn\u2019t it ok for somebody to write from the perspective of an ethnicity that they are not? If Boyne\u2019s facing criticism for choosing a non Jew to depict the Jewish experience in TBITSP, but Jeanine Cummins saw backlash for being white and writing about Mexican characters and their experiences in American Dirt, then what exactly is acceptable? Is the goal to restrict fiction writers to writing exclusively about their own lives and experiences? So then wait... where exactly does the \u201cfiction\u201d element of the writing come in then? Is the aim to make fiction obsolete, should all of literature be autobiographical? Let\u2019s remember that we are living in a climate where a fantastic fantasy author like Naomi Novik is on the verge of being cancelled because the racism police was there to sound the alarm for Novak\u2019s atrocious crimes against black people with her awful, racist stereotyping when she dreamt up some creatures of the creepy crawly variety that have a tendency of residing in long hair and laying eggs (which includes all long hair including long dreadlocks) Apparently this suggests that dreadlocks are dirty because they have been infested with said creepy crawlies and so thus furthers the racial profiling & racial stereotyping that black people are dirty. Nevermind the fact that the things resided in ALL long hair, not solely dreadlocks. And nevermind the fact that this is all taking place in a fantastical fictional world with monsters, magic, and magical schools. Of course those details are irrelevant to the racism police, they only need 1 question answered: IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY WE CAN FIND A WAY TO BE OFFENDED BY THIS? Let me pause really quickly to say that I am by no means denying that racism, stereotyping, misogyny, bigotry & all these things exist & are very much a part of life. I am a woman of color, of course I\u2019ve experienced all of these things personally. But there is a point where people seem to be actively searching for things to be upset by. Like in the case of TBWTSP. Regardless of who Bruno was, everyone already cared! We did not care solely because Bruno was a German child whom we could relate to. We cared for the very simple reason that we all know this very dark part of history, & our hearts break for every single person who fell victim. So that feels to me like the entire argument criticizing Boyne for this choice is rendered invalid. I mean, why does it even have to be offensive for a person to reach a place of empathy by realizing how perilous & fragile & ultimately nonexistent the lines between us really are? That doesn\u2019t seem wrong to me. To tell the story of a person who was willfully ignorant of the horrors of the world, & because of this choice to turn one\u2019s back on the truth wound up paying the ultimate price for his ignorance? What is so wrong with that message? I don\u2019t know. I just can\u2019t ever understand why people actively choose to be offended. We\u2019ve reached this period where the goal is no longer to be color blind, gender-blind, whatever, or to erase the lines that divide us and separate us. Cancel the color blind thing, now it\u2019s time to not only celebrate our differences, but to be able to revel in our otherness and also demand payment for all the time that came before when we couldn\u2019t. So. Since that\u2019s the case, we now have to walk on eggshells, worry ourselves silly left and right about what toes we accidentally stepped on, which misnomer slipped from our mouths, and so on ,and so forth. I understand the concept of restitution, I really do, and after a lifetimes of being subdued and repressed & crushed & quelled in every possible way & for so very long it\u2019s ok if for once the roles are reversed, that the squashed are now the ones doing the squashing...I get it, I totally get why they might be quick to the trigger after so long of never having the right. But personally I just find it to be tedious and tiring & in the end it seems like too many people wasting too much time being offended by too many things. And this story/case seems no different than all the rest. It was a story about a kid sitting at a fence that divided him from his best friend, a kid who didn\u2019t see or recognize any differences & what that ignorance ultimately cost him. I believe that a writer has the right to tell the story that comes to him/her, that\u2019s what fiction is. They are not supposed to be confined by the limitations of their own lives, or else what the f even is fiction?! To me, there is nothing offensive at the core of this story, nothing that says anybody is more or less deserving of the end that came to them and I think all the criticism and discussion surrounding it is pointless and ridiculous.

It is deeply flawed and shockingly capricious in both its literary functions and its moral obligations. If you like Holocaust literature, keep walkin', because this ain't it: this is commercialization and degradation of an international tragedy on the sickest level possible. Also: it sucks.The essence of this short fable is this: the 9 year-old son of the commandant of Auschwitz (Bruno) makes friends with a Jewish inmate and the two have tense, sedate adventures together before a violent, pornographically cheesy ending.First, the message itself: that a 9 year-old German kid would be so naive to not know a man is not falling down rather than being shot; that a prisoner is not a recreational camper; even what a Jew is. (There is an over-nine-thousand percent chance this kid would've been in Hitler Youth, based on his father's appointment alone, and he would've been exposed to antisemitic propaganda since babyhood--bullSHIT he doesn't know what a Jew is.) Bruno is so impossibly dumb. Like a horrifying, macabre episode of Rugrats, he goes on \nWACKY ADVENTURES\n resulting from some very inauthentic, English-centric misinterpretations of common German words. (Auschwitz is \"out-with,\" which makes no linguistic sense for a German character to use an English idiom; also, fuck you, that's stupid as shit.)Boyne insists on representing a child's voice by constant repetition of phrases (\"a spec became a blob,\" \"from pillar to post,\" \"a hopeless case,\" \"out of bounds and no exceptions\") which serves both to sell children's intellectual capabilities short and create and unreal, fable-like quality to the events of the narrative.This transitions us nicely to my larger complaint. A schlocky, sentimentalized child-voiced texxt may make for a bad read, but its true moral repugnance comes from making the greatest tragedy in modern western memory into a fairytale. Worse, by making such a poorly researched, hurried, unhistorical little fable, he brings the sensationalism and whimsy of fiction into strange and unwelcome territory. The effect muddles the true element of the tragedy and cheapens it. The characters are lame and insubstantial, made to seem less real by their dreamy, sing-song quality, so who cares when bad things happen to them, it was fairy-tale fate. (Also, fuck you with your Mother and your Father--give you characters names, you twat.)As Holocaust survivors die off, Holocaust literature will transition from nonfiction to fiction; it's inevitable. These fiction authors have the highest moral obligation to research their facts exhaustively, maintain a high standard of fidelity to true events, and adequately represent the silenced dead.

I started reading reviews of this book by Amazon customers and I found myself shaking my head in disbelief long before I reached the well over 100 reviews I ended up reading. I thought to myself that I must have read a different book from the customers who wrote their reviews. The reality that became obvious to me is that so many people do not even know the most basic facts about The Holocaust, and here more specifically about the concentration camps. This speaks to the reality of how little if anything people are taught in school about The Holocaust and that general populations around the world eat what is spoon fed to them whether they be lies or the truth. Then they continue to spread misinformation to others, or simply don't give a dam about the annihilation of millions of peoples only 65 years ago. \"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas\" is a historical novel. Although it is a novel it is incumbent upon the author to not cloud, twist, or change facts of history, and especially not facts about a time when the goal of human beings was the total annihilation of millions upon millions of other human beings. I suppose if people do not know the truth and the facts about The Holocaust that their high praise and lust for an emotional and unique story could be understood. What the author and publisher of this book did is an entirely different matter. When writing a historical novel research must be done by the author in order to preserve the truth and facts of history. It seems unlikely to me that this author did not do enough research about The Holocaust and the concentration camps to know that what he was writing was at best a disregard of truth and facts. It seems more likely to me that this author did do research about The Holocaust and CHOSE to ignore and disregard the facts in order to create a fantastical tale of impossibility that he knew would sell like hot cakes. One would think that a major publishing company would do its due diligence in order to not pervert verifiable facts of history, and that it would not knowingly publish a book that would make a mockery of history. One million copies of \"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas\" were sold as of just a few days ago. Clearly the sale of one million books took and takes precedence over not annihilating the truth and facts about the millions of human beings who were annihilated, as well as in essence, spitting in the faces of the very few who did survive.

However, I didn\u2019t find the writing as captivating as I would like. Which you can write for little kids and still have it be mildly entertaining, but this didn\u2019t really do it for me. The repetition of the phrases got wearisome, but it wasn\u2019t that bad. The quotations drove me absolutely insane. Instead of \u201cHello\u201d, it\u2019s \u2018Hello\u2019. Ridiculously petty, but it still managed to bother me. The naivety of Bruno was irksome. It was ridiculous to hear about how he practically knew nothing about anything. As a child, it shouldn\u2019t have been too hard to piece a few things together. The author seems to have underestimated the mental capacity of young children, because I assure you, they do not act like this. If anything, his older sisters Gretal\u2019s knowledge is even more limited. She asked \u201cwhat type of people don\u2019t have baths.\u201d Please, she sounds like a snob. I\u2019ve been educated on World War II on a very basic level. I will not pretend to have an extensive understanding of the subject, but it has piqued my interest over the years. Due to this, I have read several books over WWII that would be a better way to spend your time reading. Number the Stars, for starters. It\u2019s still for young readers but extremely fascinating and it delves into multiple subjects over the course of a small book. I truly believe that the editor of this book was half asleep the entire time. Sometimes the author spells pajama correctly, and other times it\u2019s \u201cpyjama.\u201d The inconsistencies were probably the most consistent things about this book. The things Bruno said were so out of touch and insensitive. I understand he is a child, but even children have enough understanding to realize something isn\u2019t right and to fit a few pieces together. Shmuel could\u2019ve done the same thing. He didn\u2019t hear the word \u201cghetto\u201d passed around a few times whilst he was staying in that one-room flat? It seems completely bizarre that these children were that sheltered from reality. (Not to say Shmuel was particularly sheltered, due to his experiences, however he was unaware of many things while simultaneously being aware of it. If that makes any sense at all.) To put it bluntly, all of the kids were written as if by a 60 year old man that has no idea how a kid behaves. Also the mispronunciation of words was annoying. It was supposed to come off as a clever pun, when it reality it was an awful use of word play. The ending caught me by surprise - I had been warned that this book would be sad, however I still didn\u2019t believe it. Even when the ending happened, all I could think of was \u201cOh.\u201d It was so sudden that I hardly had time to process it.

Here the exchange is between a 9-year-old Bruno and his sister Gretel, who is 3 years older. Like their other exchanges, it left me with a chill. It was seeing the contrast between Bruno not readily accepting what he is told and Gretel\u2019s keen need to accept to feel more grown up. Meanwhile, throughout this novel I felt the suspense was kept taught by Bruno\u2019s natural verve to feel something was not quite right.Boyne\u2019s story is written for children but the dramatic irony that was visible to my adult mind made this a poignant read. It\u2019s moments like when Bruno first meets Shmuel. Bruno is jealous of Shmuel who (he feels) has many others to play with on his side of the fence when he has none. It\u2019s an eerie moment as Bruno, in all his innocents, has no concept of how his new friend would prefer to be on his side of the fence. It\u2019s the first of many that happen; Bruno\u2019s young mind has not perceived how Shmuel leads a life of suffering and pain that is beyond his imagination. Then there were the moments where Bruno unwittingly expresses anti-sematic ideas without fully comprehending what he has said. That mix of unaware cruelty was unsettling.Right to the end, Boyne\u2019s story cleverly leaves enough room for it to be appreciated by both children and adult readers. The last moment, when it comes, is shocking and tragic; Boyne in one stroke shows how both Bruno and Shmuel are the victims of this terrible, terrible moment in history.", "num_likes": 11, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["world-wars-covered-in-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3718882855", "review_id": "3718882855", "date": "Dec 28, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "\u2728H\u2728", "user_url": "/user/show/25496928-h", "text": "The boy in the stripped pajamas is a story that exposes darker aspects of ourselves and our world .

When Shmuel used to tell him about his experiences instead of listening Bruno used to counteract it very a childish story of his own.

There are spoilers in the reflections that follow, but the book is so deeply flawed that it is hard to see how the reading experience could be spoiled beyond what it already is.The Boy in the Striped Pajamas seems on its way to becoming a classic of Holocaust literature for children. This is unfortunate, even alarming. The author accomplishes the opposite of his stated goal. Instead of warning against the dangers of complacency, he excuses that complacency. Instead of conveying the realities of antisemitism and the horrors of the industrialized genocide of Jews, the author softens and twists these realities for the sake of a plot device. We as readers float through a bubble of foggy ignorance until the end, none the wiser for our journey. The moral of this self-styled \"fable\" - the idea that fences are arbitrary and nothing really separates \"us\" from \"them\" - may, in itself, be laudable. But any good intentions the author had are undermined by a contrived and simplistic plot which, by misrepresenting the historical facts of Nazi death camps, does deep injustice to the memory of the Holocaust and threatens to mislead generations of readers.There are books on the Holocaust that manage to convey the horrific realities of genocide in a way suitable for children. This is not one of them. There is no single right way to relate the history of the Holocaust, but any retelling that distorts events to extent of misrepresenting their very nature is deeply flawed. It is possible to engage with difficult subjects without distorting them. John Boyne failed. Perhaps one cannot call a book that has received such an immense amount of positive critical attention a failure. But its very financial success points to another kind of failure - a failure on the part of readers, and perhaps, our educational systems. We should ask ourselves why this book has received so much praise. What makes this particular treatment of the Holocaust so appealing, so seductive, that it has become an instant classic?Many of my criticisms might be dismissed by the simple reminder that this is a \u201cfable.\u201d Boyne is telling a universal story about genocide and the fences that divide \u201cus\u201d from \u201cthem.\u201d But he chose to set his fable in a particular time and place. This particular place is Auschwitz and the time is 1942. The scattered details we glimpse of dress, speech, and world events all localize the story to this particular time and place. To argue (as Boyne does in his author interview) that the protagonist calling it \u201cOut-With\u201d instead of Auschwitz allows the \u201cfable\u201d to attain some kind of universal resonance, and thereby presumably excuse any historical inaccuracies because it is not, after all, an attempt at realism, is absurd. What the author chose to emphasize, to gloss over, and to simply erase from his story has consequences for how the reader understands the subject matter. And the subject matter is not a fantasy, it is the murder of millions of people. The historical inaccuracies in Boyne\u2019s story are staggeringly obvious to anyone with basic knowledge of the Holocaust. The popularity of this book indicates how lacking this basic knowledge is. The story is such a quick, engaging read that readers without historical grounding will find themselves drawn into this false vision of the Holocaust until the tragic end. Despite the story\u2019s glaring plot holes and inaccuracies, it is well constructed and, for many readers, emotionally effective. These readers have no reason to question the story as it is presented, since it reaffirms the basic message that genocide is a horrible and inexcusable thing. It would not occur to them to be skeptical of a story whose basic message is morally self-evident. That makes Boyne\u2019s representation of the Holocaust all the more pernicious. Giving readers such a distorted vision of the Holocaust makes a mockery of the real horrors that took place. What Boyne has done, to be blunt, is exploit the Holocaust for the sake of a book concept. That Boyne\u2019s intentions were possibly benevolent does nothing to lessen the impact of his book.The inaccuracies of Boyne's story are also its foundational premises. They are too numerous and too integral to the plot to be excused. One might start with how ignorant Bruno, the protagonist, is of the world in which he lives. This appears to be the major criticism that Boyne has received and he attempts, unconvincingly, to address it in his author interview. It is not simply unlikely that a nine-year-old son of an SS-officer would be so ignorant of his world, it is impossible. We are asked to believe that he has never heard or spoken the word \u201cJew\u201d before his conversation with his sister towards the end of the book. We are asked to believe that a child with his background in his time and place could, in all innocence, ask his sister, \u201cAre we Jews?\u201d As Boyne emphasizes in his interview, complacency helped make the Holocaust possible, but he completely erases the fact that it is complacency grounded in a long history of antisemitism, and bolstered by a vigorous and totalizing propaganda apparatus that would have almost certainly seen Bruno join the Pimpfe, kiddie Hitler Youth for ages 6-10. Boyne asks us to excuse Bruno\u2019s ignorance because he had a sheltered life. But Bruno\u2019s sheltered life of privilege would have left him in no doubt of where to draw the lines between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d Boyne cautions readers not to impose our hindsight on Bruno, but it is not Bruno\u2019s ignorance of the concentration camps that is inconceivable, it is his ignorance of, and complete immunity from, his own society\u2019s prejudices. Fences don\u2019t just grow out of nowhere.Boyne would have the reader believe that the Holocaust happened because too many people simply looked away. He should be asking why it was so easy for so many people to look away. He tries to divorce complacency from the deep-seated hatred that built invisible fences long before the physical ones were built. The effect of this is to absolve those who are complacent from their active complicity in creating a society where genocide is thinkable, let alone possible.The most problematic element of this book is not its distortion of history, which is problematic enough. It is how Boyne casts the protagonist Bruno as the true victim of the story. It is not a matter of Boyne's intentions, but rather an effect of the narrative structure he chose. If Boyne's book is a fable, then the protagonist Bruno represents ignorance, complacency, or more charitably, innocence. His innocence and his kindness, which seems to be a product of this innocence, make him the ill-fated hero of this tragedy. We see the world and all the characters that populate it through his eyes. We are drawn to sympathize with him, this innocent little boy caught in a world he cannot understand. After all, how can we fault a little boy for failing to comprehend the horrors unfolding around him? The story is his story, not the story of his Jewish counterpart across the fence, Shmuel. Shmuel exists as a foil to him, not a character in his own right. Again, this is a matter of the narrative structure and is independent of whatever background knowledge of the Holocaust we may bring to the reading. Perhaps sensing the one-sidedness of his story (until the very end, we are rooted on one side of the fence, not the other), Boyne grants us a few forays into Shmuel\u2019s point of view, but these glimpses of Shmuel\u2019s thoughts are as unsatisfying as they are brief. Shmuel\u2019s thoughts and words ring hollow because Boyne is unable or unwilling to confront what it was really like to be in a death camp. Shmuel is the mental projection of someone who cannot confront the burden of guilt borne by those who turn a blind eye to dehumanization.Despite Bruno\u2019s absolute inability to understand Shmuel's life experiences, he and Shmuel are friends. One might question how friendship can grow and persist over months without any degree of understanding developing. We learn that Shmuel thinks Bruno is \u201cso friendly and kind\u201d despite who his father is. At a symbolic level, then, the victim of the Holocaust is absolving the complacent bystander of any responsibility. Bruno\u2019s friendship to Shmuel redeems him of the guilt of complacency. In the story\u2019s twist ending, Bruno\u2019s friendship to Shmuel is also what kills him.Whatever realities Bruno witnesses, he is invariably drawn back into his naivet\u00e9. When he is finally forced to confront these brutal realities in the gas chamber, it is his death that serves as the dramatic climax. His death is the shocking twist that is supposed to haunt the reader. The Jews trapped in the gas chamber are never more than a shadowy impression. They were going to die anyway.Which brings us to the defining image of this story - two boys sitting on the ground facing each other, a barbed wire fence dividing them. Was it ignorance that led Boyne to choose Auschwitz as his setting? Was it an irresistible attachment to the pun of Out-With and Auschwitz? In any case, having chosen Auschwitz, he proceeds to write a story that could not possibly have taken place there, but by slapping \"a fable\" on the title page he absolves himself of responsibility to historical fact. A reader unfamiliar with the Holocaust will finish the book with a wholly inaccurate impression of Auschwitz. Boyne tries to convey the horrors of Auschwitz but he is hindered by the demands of his premise. There is a nine-year-old boy who survived not just for hours, but for months. Somehow, he didn't die of starvation, he didn't die in unspeakable medical experiments, he didn't die of disease, he didn't get shot or beaten to death. He has free time almost every afternoon to amble to his spot by the fence. Children can run around the camp playing detective. There is a section of the fence that is unguarded, unelectrified. And there is a place in the fence where a child can crawl to the other side. Somehow, no one has thought to escape.And Shmuel, the Jewish half-character who knows too well what life is like in the death camp, convinces his friend Bruno to join him on the other side, the inside. When Bruno wants to leave the camp, Shmuel convinces him to stay longer. In this bizarre way, the Jewish boy becomes the instrument of Bruno's death. I am forced to conclude that neither the writer nor the readers who praise his book have considered the logical implications of the story.There is something grotesque in the story's simplicity, readability, and terrible obliviousness to its own message.", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["ww2-holocaust"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4508712230", "review_id": "4508712230", "date": "Jan 27, 2022", "rating": "", "user_name": "notgettingenough ", "user_url": "/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough", "text": "When the book first came out, it seemed to me that it would turn out just how it has; to quote fromhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/202...According to research by the Centre for Holocaust Education at University College London, more than a third of teachers in England use the bestselling book and film adaptation in lessons on the Nazi genocide.A study, to be published shortly, builds on research conducted five years ago among secondary school pupils which found that the story by John Boyne regularly elicited misplaced sympathy for Nazis.According to the new survey, 35% of teachers used The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas in lessons about the Holocaust. However, its use occupies a \u201csomewhat contested position as a potential educational resource\u201d, the centre\u2019s report says. Drama and English teachers were more likely to use it than history teachers.Boyne\u2019s book is about a friendship between the son of an Auschwitz commandant and a Jewish boy incarcerated in the Nazi concentration camp.

These two books are almost two sides of the same coin where the former is a Jewish girl\u2019s autobiography and the latter is a German boy\u2019s story. Where one is real the other is fiction.Bruno is a 9 year old German boy who stayed in Berlin with his Father, Mother and Sister Gretel. Bruno\u2019s father is a high ranking army official. The story starts off with the family\u2019s hasty move from the comfort of their Berlin home to a new isolated place that is surrounded by an endless barbed fence. On the other side of this fence, Bruno sees people all dressed in the same striped pyjamas. Who are these people? Don\u2019t they have anything else to wear? Why do they all look so sad?Ok, so despite all the blind spots/potholes I want to applaud the author for one thing, that he created a 9 year old character that actually thinks and acts his age\u2026(a slow kid actually). If you compare him to other fictional over-smart kids like Anne of Green Gables, Oliver Twist etc Bruno is just a normal kid. Regardless of his innocent perspective, he makes all of our adult things seem silly and over-complicated. Quoting a few from the book:\u201cWhat exactly was the difference? he wondered to himself. And who decided which people wore the striped pajamas and which people wore the uniforms?\u201d \u201cIn his heart, he knew that there was no reason to be impolite to someone, even if they did work for you.

Definitely not. Also please don\u2019t expect that a 9 year old sheltered boy should have had a better understanding of this very troubled era of the Holocaust, because this was not the intention.

Read it in the hope that one day there will be a world with no fences and even if there are, you should at least get to choose which side you want to say on and not be judged for it.

I didn't let this deter me from making an attempt at The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. For better or for worse, I didn't get very far before the author's perspective and poor attempt at word play made me quit reading. A message to Mr. John Boyne: When you're writing an English book about Germans in Germany speaking German, English puns don't make sense (i.e. Auschwitz = \"out-with, out with what?\"). Also, Germans (as well as most of Europe) uses the metric system(since the late 1800s). This means they wouldn't be asking how many MILES it is to some place, they'd ask how many KILOMETERS. But the final line that made me close the book was his portrayal of Nazis as people. From the very beginning, Boyne sets up the Nazi characters to be instantly despicable, even through the eyes of a Nazi-raised boy. Boyne seems to believe that our right and wrong are universally understood--even by those that are brought up to believe otherwise. What's more, by the time I closed to book, Boyne was beginning to make the Nazis out to be monsters with no conscience. Think about this: dehumanizing the enemy is exactly what the Nazis did to the Jews, which is why they were able to do such horrible things to them without feeling bad about it. If we dehumanize the Nazis and portray them as evil monsters, how are we any better than they? This book is the opposite of enlightening.

So, this heart-breaking and upsetting tale takes a moralistic form and is replete with motifs that reflect upon human nature, extending from the atrocities of Nazi Germany and even beyond it.First of all, there is the motif of Bruno himself who has child-like innocence and has that essential empathy which symbolises the missing link between the tortured and the torturer. The book is written with the naivety and immature pensiveness of a 9-year old child. That clearly is intended upon looking at the situations of Jews from the German perspective stripped off all the prejudices of differences between uniforms and striped attire. The wonder and curiosity that every child uses as his/her goggles to view his/her own world starkly differs Bruno from even his slightly older sister who seems to have been affected by that maturity and ownership of self-founded, self-righteous opinion which paints everything in supremacy and inferiority. Bruno questions everything starting from a blank slate and empathises with those who are supposed to be his enemy - trying to see beyond the fence dividing the two parties and balancing their differences with their similarities.And then there is the motif of the Fence. It is the first thing that Bruno observes in his changed surroundings. He knows that somebody else has created the fence and somebody else has decided to decide who wears the stripes in this case. He dares to explore and see beyond it when he meets his friend Shmuel. In Shmuel, he sees his own reflection of childhood worries and lost memories of the world that both of them are trying to preserve to prevent it from crumbling, while being in totally different sides of fate. Fence becomes that literal barrier which prevents one's thoughts from crossing across established systems of conformance. It does not matter if one side or both are trying hard to maintain this fence. It is challenging the status quo of answers that don't make sense in the face of critical questions. The Fence then becomes a fragile construct resting on irrational beliefs of few, that can be broken through and allow people to come together.Finally, there is the motif of Striped Pyjamas which represents the loss of individuality that is the cause and consequence of this historical tragedy. Losing one's identity is immediately followed by a loss of purpose and when push comes to shove, it is easy to get absorbed in the collective fate called history. People become numbers and statistics and either one latches on to irrational hope or completely abandons it. As a mirroring effect, the same uniform of Nazi Germany soldiers subsumed their individuality to think and act in the collective patriotism and righteousness to continue unquestionably on the path of ethnic and cultural cleansing. It was only when someone like Bruno crossed that Fence, one feels how easy it is so get lost among so many who are being herded in confusion and powerlessness and one's identity does not matter anymore in the face of survival instinct.This book is often criticised for the preference of fiction over facts that it gives in terms of Bruno's excessive childishness in the face of something as serious as Holocaust and regarding the impossibility of such a thing happening. I do not agree with it and without any disrespect and offence to the authenticity of preserving facts and memoirs from concentration camps like Auschwitz, I believe author's aim is to see how fundamentally self-constructed are the divides in history that build up tragedies to the scale of Nazi Germany and even continue in some form, somewhere else after it. The fundamentally uncorrupted and eventually victimised human nature is borne not just by the sufferers but also by the ones who lose their morality for \"something greater\". The fable-like lightness in telling such an unbearable darkness is an uncomfortable experience but a necessary one to be confronted by all those young adults whose personalities get shaped by the questions they ask and the answers they get. Even the author ends with an ironical note to be reflected upon:\"Of course all this happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again.

I often wonder if this is the reason some of my YA ratings seem inflated when I go back and look at them years later.But what's the point of reviewing a book if we can't be honest in our review?So, students who loved this book and are asking, why only two stars? Here you go: this review's for you.First off, the writing wasn't terrible. It wasn't even bad - especially for a book meant for 4th and 5th graders. (I'm assuming that's who the book was meant for, anyway.)I enjoyed reading it.But two things grated on me as I read: I couldn't believe the protagonist, and the transliterations of Auschwitz and Furor were too much.So, Bruno is 9? And he hasn't heard of Hitler? And he lives in Berlin? And his dad's a Commandant...? And Hitler and Eva Braun had even been over for dinner?This is 1943. Hitler came to power in 1933 (really much earlier than that). There is no way this kid didn't know who Hitler was. No doubt, with Bruno's connections he would have been leading the marches of the Hitlerjugend. Or since he was too young, he would have been looking longingly out the window, waiting for the chance to join up... They'd find a place for him. (Honestly though, I'm sure they could have bent the age restrictions for the son of The Commandant.)And it's a nice literary device to have Bruno confuse F\u00fchrer with Fury, but only makes sense if it works in the narrative - which it doesn't. Two reasons, really: Bruno speaks German, so it doesn't make sense for him to conflate it with an English word. \"Fury\" in German is \"wut\" which sounds nothing like F\u00fchrer or fury in English. Second, not knowing the word/title F\u00fchrer would be like a 9 year old not knowing the word/title President.Again, I realize the literary significance of calling the F\u00fchrer Fury, or Auschwitz Out-With, but if that was the case, Bruno should have been 5 years old at the oldest in order to maintain the credibility of the story.I have the same feelings when Bruno put a dash (-) for the word Jude or Judentum or whatever, when he understood the word \"Jew\" later on, since Jude is German for Jew.Maybe I'm being too critical of the book, since it's meant to be an introduction to the Holocaust for elementary school children. Boyne says in the back of my edition, \"...I believed that the only respectful way for me to deal with this subject was through the eyes of a child, and particularly through the eyes of a rather naive child who couldn't possibly understand the terrible things that were taking place around him.\"I'll never be able to go back and see how I was introduced to the Holocaust. But now, having read and watched Schindler's List, watching The Pianoist, reading Bloodlands, visiting The Holocaust Museum... The list, of course, goes on and on... my experiences may have led me away from (or to look down on) what needs to be a more delicate introduction for those still in the innocence of youth.The biggest redeeming quality of the book? The ending. The whole last chapter, and the last lines.I couldn't not think of Janusz Korczak and his children.I don't know if it's because I'm getting older and I'm not as naive as I used to be that I feel like hatred is increasing - or if it's because hatred is actually increasing, but I feel troubled by it.

So kudos for blindsiding me at the end there!Looking at other reviews, this seems to be one of those love-it-or-hate-it books, and I can kinda see both sides. It took me quite a long time to get into it, and while I eventually got the hang of Boyne's rhythm - oft-repeated phrases, a simplified writing style as if aimed at a considerably younger readership than the material lends itself too - the friction between style and story continued to jar right up to the real gut-punch of a finale. I ended up kinda thinking of this as almost a fable or fairy tale. With chapter names like \"Out Of Bounds At All Times And No Exceptions\" and \"The Dot That Became a Speck That Became a Blob That Became a Figure That Became a Boy,\" there was a sense of playful \"once upon a time\" fantasy that made it otherwise difficult to take the story too seriously - which then made it all the more jarring when it ultimately did turn very serious. And the fact that so many things were never really named but merely alluded to - not just the whole \"Nazis\" and \"concentration camp\" thing, but also whatever violence was committed against Pavel and just what the heck the creepy relationship between Bruno's mom and Lieutenant Kotler was all about - also gives the whole thing a filter of unreality and almost dreaminess.Other than using the word \"unsettled,\" I still don't know how I ultimately feel about this book - hence the non-committal 3 stars. I'm therefore writing this review like I read the book - quickly and without pausing to really think, straight through from beginning to end. And when I'm done, then maybe I'll stop and reflect on what the hell just happened here.ONE FINAL THOUGHT, on one the problems in writing in the voice of \"foreigners:\" I understand Boynes' purpose in having his young narrator mispronounce things in a way that gave them a deeper hidden meaning - calling the F\u00fchrer \"the Fury,\" or pronouncing Auschwitz as \"Out-With\" - but those obviously only work in English, not in German which all his characters were obviously supposed to be speaking. So...weird, and - again - kind of unsettling when you really think about it.UPDATE: And bumping this up a star based on the movie version - didn't realize they HAD made a movie, but found it on HBO Max and it was very good, if equally shocking at the end. \nREGARDING HBO Max,\n  if you get your cable TV or mobile service through Verizon, Cox, DIrectTV or many others (you can find the full list here: https://play.hbomax.com/login?reenter...), you may well have HBO Max included free with your service.

However, having grown more mature of the years I thought I'd give this book another go and see if it justifies its many literary awards.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is about the friendship between two nine-year-old boys: one a high-ranking Nazi officer's son having recently relocated from Berlin to Poland, and the other a Jew stuck behind barbed wire in an infamous death camp. Neither one seems to have any understanding of why things are the way they are and as their friendship develops over time, the horrific realities of war and antisemitism eventually catch up with them. What is interesting about this book is the subtleties which are woven in through the use of an unconventional narrator. Through a nine-year-old child's eyes we see parental affairs, the meanings of symbols that have caused so much tragic division, the confusion of territory and nationalism. One of my favourite moments is when the Fuhrer attends dinner at the family's place in Berlin, and the children boast about their ability to speak French. Curtly, the Fuhrer questions the use of learning French, which causes confusion for the children and tension and fear from the parents. Simple scenes such as these illustrate the extent of a cold underlying barbarity to the war: a cruel truth which the children can't understand, but can recognise all the same.On the other hand, other moments show Bruno as selfish, immature and more of a six-year-old - perhaps if he was this age some moments would be more believable. For example, Bruno doesn't know what a Jew is or what it means for hundreds of people to be trapped behind barbed wire. Surely Bruno would know what prisons are, and would have overheard mentions about the camp from his father who works inside it with other soldiers. Contextually, Bruno would have likely been part of the indoctrinating Hitler youth schemes, or in the least have heard some media propaganda.Another thing that bothered me is the matter of the hole beneath the fence: small enough to slip food under and eventually large enough to allow a small child to fit through. However, it seems unlikely that nobody has even attempted to escape the same way. It would be plausible to suggest that Shmuel tried to escape this way in search of his father.Overall, this book was a simple story, and yet highlights the monstrosity of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, I didn't really feel attached enough to any of the characters, except slightly for Shmuel - I wish more of the story focused on him as he was more of an interesting character and had a distinct voice.

She said that it would make me cry. Well, it didn't...but it was a good, enjoyable story nonetheless. Perhaps \"enjoyable\" isn't the best word to describe this book, considering the subject matter (Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz). Nine-year-old Bruno lives with his mother, father and sister in a huge house in Berlin. One day, much to his surprise and great consternation, the maid packs up his belongings and informs him that the family is moving. Bruno is miserable at his new, smaller house. From his bedroom window, he sees a \"nasty-looking place\"--a barbed-wire fence enclosing hundreds of boys and men who are all dressed in striped pajamas. Curious, he inquires about this odd group of people. \"...they're not people at all, Bruno,\" his father (the commandant) informs him. Before long, Bruno begins exploring the area and walks over to the fence. He finds and befriends an emaciated boy his age. He visits him often, bringing him food and snacks whenever possible. The boy in the striped pajamas becomes his well-guarded secret. Kept in ignorance, Bruno has no comprehension of the things that happen on the other side of the fence. But one day he will find out the hard way.This is a simplistic, yet engaging, story. Towards the end I was truly overcome with a sense of dread as I anticipated the events to come. The bitter irony and poetic justice is horrifying and memorable. It's a poignant reminder that true evil exists in the world. But of course, \"...nothing like that could ever happen again.

The concept of viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a child is fascinating. The chosen perspective is so unique and the writing style fits perfectly. Or to put it more finely: stylistically, this book is faultless. But in historical context, it just doesn't feel plausible. First of all, Hitler and unofficial girlfriend Eva Braun turn up alone and unguarded for dinner at a house in Berlin, in the middle of the war, in order to discuss a promotion. I thought Eva Braun had to masquerade as Hitler's secretary and that they never ever ever appeared in public together? And why would Hitler take her along to this meeting anyway?!Second, a Lieutenant casually lets slip that his father left Germany in 1938, the year of Kristallnacht when the Nazis really knuckled down on the Jews etc., thus heavily implying that he is of Jewish decent. Bearing in mind how strict the Nazis were about German citizenship (if you had any Jewish relatives beyond the fourth generation you were considered a Jew), it's very, very, very unlikely this man would even be living a normal life at this time, let alone hold the title of Lieutenant.Another technical difficulty: I don't understand how a child can easily slip under the wire into Auschwitz, but no one attempts to exercise this method vice versa. What?!I'm not sure what age group this book is geared towards. From the way it is written, it feels as though it is for a younger age range. But the context is so watered down, you'd need to have a pretty comprehensive understanding of history in order to fit all the jigsaw pieces together.The English mishearings were also specious. How can a German child mistake Der Fuhrer for 'The Fury'? The German word for 'fury' does not sound like the phonetics of the English word 'fury'. Ditto, how does Auschwitz sound like Out-With to a German child? I feel like these mishearings would've been a nice touch to the sense of naivety and innocence, but the fact that it transcends the language barrier is unrealistic.Overall, an interesting book. I think had the story been told a little more explicitly, it would give a bit more of a punch to the ending. Had I read this before I'd taken my History GCSE, I don't think I would have clicked with all the subtle details that John Boyne weaved throughout.

Most of what I saw misses the point entirely. First, let me say that I would classify this book as political satire in the vein of Orwell's  Animal Farm  or Huxley's  Brave New World . I would not classify it as children's literature. Therefore, the appalling ignorance of the child narrator is not meant to condone the evil being presented. In fact, Bruno's attitude may be more psychologically realistic than some people give it credit for. Children interpret unfamiliar situations and even unfamiliar words in terms of familiar ones. In Bruno's case, rather than truly correcting him, the adults in his life reinforce his innocence. Let me focus on the words for a minute. \"The Fury\" and \"Out With\" are mispronunciations of German words. In fact, \"out with\" is a translation of a German mispronunciation of a German word. Bruno is taking what are meaningless names to him and turning them into more familiar ones. Is Bruno old enough to learn to correctly pronounce new words? Yes, but in this case his mispronunciations carry a meaning that are more accurate for the situation than the meanings of the actual words. Sometimes children stumble unto truth they do not even understand. Granted, the facts of the story are not realistic. However, realism or lack of realism is not the point. The point is, in the words of Edmund Burke, \"the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\"For me, this book was incredibly hard to read. I would not say that I enjoyed it, which is why I chose not to give it a rating. It's just not the kind of book you can rate.

The fence in the story that divides Auschwitz and the Nazi community resemble the divide between people. Ultimately, however, both boys die in a gas chamber; I think this signifies that beneath race, beneath religion, beneath sexuality--beneath it all, we are the same humans. During the 1940s, Germany was in a grave time period called the Holocaust. The Jewish community and further persecuted individuals were treated with contempt and disdain. The story starts off with Bruno moving near the Auschwitz concentration camp and continues with the gradual building of Bruno and Shmuel's friendship. The part that caught my attention the most was the ending, with not only both boys dying in a gas chamber but Bruno's father finding out about how exactly his son has died.

From having no personal experience of what it must have been like during the holocaust of the 1940s (I say it like this because there have been holocausts throughout history that must not be forgotten); I can only really judge this book on how it made me feel. The naivety that Bruno shows is a little maddening but it does make you feeling like you are tumbling towards a fate that can not be altered, it's already been decided and I think that many readers may feel the same when reading this.

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas  surprised me in a number of ways. It's narrated by a child, but the writing style is fluid and easy to read, all the while never losing the distinct feel of a child's perspective. I had expected the story to be darker and depressing, as many books set during the Holocaust tend to be, given the subject matter. While not particularly cheery, the book isn't very somber either. This is largely due to Bruno's innocence--he has no idea what's going on around him. I found this aspect very unrealistic, and his \"innocence\" comes off more as ignorance to me. Even if Bruno's parents had been sheltering him from what was going on, he had friends while living in Berlin, and he should have noticed some of what was going on around him. That said, I understand that his naivety was critical for the plot of the book, but it made Bruno a very unlikable and unrelatable main character.

No friends anywhere, only his annoying sister. All Bruno sees is the inside of the house he lives in and from the window in his room the camp, with people dressed in striped pyjamas: pyjama bottoms, pyjama tops and a striped pyjama cap!

That aside, I did appreciate reading about the Holocaust through the lens of a young reader AND I can say with certainty that this story -- of Bruno and Shmuel and their interconnected lives -- will remain with me always. Boyne captures the psychological cruelty of the Nazis much more so than the physical brutality (to which the latter is only alluded). It is told from the perspective of 9-year old Bruno, whose father is a Nazi commander at Auschwitz toward the end of World War II. While Boyne captures Bruno's childlike innocence, I'm not sure how realistic it is that the son of a Nazi commander would really not know the words \"Auschwitz\" or \"Jew\" (or that the latter isn't even mentioned until the book's final pages). From everything I've read about the Third Reich, Nazi propaganda was pervasive -- to all German citizens, but particularly, I would imagine, to a Nazi family living right at Auschwitz. And while I know this is somewhat of a fable, I do wish Boyne had taken the opportunity to be more informative to young readers about the systematic anti-Semitism that characterized this horrific period of Jewish history.Having said that, I found myself deeply moved by the story between the two boys. Perhaps Boyne chose to keep Bruno insulated from Nazism to show the power of compassion -- that even in the midst of the horrors around them, a German boy can love a Jewish boy all the same. \"Very slowly he [Lieutenant Kotler] turned his head back to look at Shmuel, who wasn't crying any more, merely staring at the floor and looking as if he was trying to convince his soul not to live inside his tiny body any more, but to slip away and sail to the door and rise up into the sky, gliding through the clouds until it was very far away,\" Boyne writes.

I loved the plot, loved the fact that this is a book about a very important part of people's history (though a very sad one) and the fact that the story is told in first person, by a child so sweet and innocent. Bruno is 9 year old boy, a son of an SS Officer and lives with his family in Berlin. One day, his father is given an assignment in Auschwitz so Bruno has to leave his good friends behind, and go to live to this strange place, who's name he can't even pronounce (He calls it \"Out-With\")And now we get to the part that got me confused a bit and made me suspicious about the author's writing quality. Bruno and his sister Gretel (who is 12) have no idea why they have no one to play with in that strange place. They see huts, and strange people dressed the same, but don't actually know why they live on the other side of the fence. Who are they? Why are they all skinny? And why can't he play with them. This is when I got angry, both at Bruno and Mr. Boyne! Bruno doesn't know what the word \"Jew\" means!And he repeatedly makes the same mistake calling the Fuhrer, The Fury!Jesus..what's wrong with this kid. Is he blind or stupid? How can he NOT know what's going on around him?And Gretel, who is 3 years older and is supposed to know more (so you think! ha!) is equally unaware of those skinny, tortured people living in the huts and buildings around them.And that's when friends come to help.  :)Just when I was seriously thinking should I put off the reading of this book, I start a conversation on this book with 2 of my GR friends and I start to question...and wonder...and think. As the conversation evolved, I started remembering what I was like when I was 9. What I had during my childhood...and what Bruno has...actually lacks. I felt enlightened!  I read few reviews around here, and many people got the impression that Bruno and Gretel seem a bit retarded and that Boyne had no idea what he was writing about. And I don't blame anyone for their opinion...I almost felt the same (ok, I didn't think the kids were retarded, but I called them weird). But you know..just forget about their age now and try to look a bit into their souls. They whisper - May this evil never happen again.There's one sentence in the book...something Bruno tells his friend at \"Out-With\" which I will remember always.\"We will have to agree to disagree.\"  Lovely story that will warm your heart, make you feel all kinds of different emotions...and remind you of \"the innocent, sweet kid\" that is trapped inside your mature body.", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["read-more-than-once", "read-in-2011", "historical-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1076052899", "review_id": "1076052899", "date": "Oct 09, 2014", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Phoebe", "user_url": "/user/show/18985202-phoebe", "text": " I remember seeing this book around a few years ago constantly, and although a great lover of historical fiction I never picked it up. However, last year I found a copy in a discount book store and decided to give it a go. My friends have always thought me slightly odd for my fascination with the Holocaust. But being such a tragic period of history I've always been intrigued by it, just wanting to understand how something so despicable had ever come to pass, and just what happened within there walls. This is the first fiction book I've read that's incorporated Concentration Camps and for that I find it brave - even more so being what I assume is a middle grade book - to create a story from such an event. The story follows a boy named Bruno who moves with his family from Berlin to the outskirts of Auschwitz Concentration Camp with his dad's new promotion. Bruno dislikes his new house as he's had to leave all his friends behind, and he doesn't understand why there's so many people walking around in striped pyjamas behind a fence outside his house. As the book continues, Bruno starts to adapt to life within his new house, and one day embarks on an adventure and meets a boy behind the fence, called Shmuel. And the start of a friendship begins. I must admit it took me a while to get on board with the writing style in this book, it may just have been because I haven't read a middle grade book in so long, but I found it repetitive and wish-washy. But that's my only complaint for this book; the story, characters and message were all beautifully delivered. I just wish I'd have picked up this book earlier. I know there is a film, which I haven't seen, but I will get round to watching when I have a spare few minutes away from dissertation and assignment writing! If anyone else, like me, hasn't read this book before, I would definitely give it a go. It only took me an evening to read, and it's so interesting to see how John Boyne goes about writing such a difficult topic for younger readers, a definite eye opener.

The idea of viewing Auschwitz from the nine-year-old son of the German commandant, was a masterstroke, and brilliantly brought to life. As an adult reader, I winced as it became ever clearer to my eyes what were clouded to our young narrator's, but I wonder what the effect would be for a young reader? And how young?

I thought that it is a hugely powerful book, written from a child's perspective on a horrendous chapter of human history.", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["books-read-2011"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2109676711", "review_id": "2109676711", "date": "Sep 07, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Veronique", "user_url": "/user/show/54190877-veronique", "text": "This is such a heartbreaking story...I really cried in my car while listening to this book.This book has a great buildup to the end of the story, however the end was so short and quick and I would have wanted a little bit more pain and cry-worthy minutes... You follow the story through the eyes and logic of a 9 year old boy in WW 2, and it is amazing how this book describes the thought of Bruno. Really the author did a marvellous job in it. I like it how he is so naive and doesn't understand the problems of the world he is living in.I think it is so sad what happened in the holocaust and I think we should all keep remembering what happened those years.Because this is never allowed to happen again! Enjoy your reading\ud83d\udcda And if you want to cry your eyes out, I recommend reading this book.

I absolutely loved and adored Bruno, he was so opinionated and blunt. I related to him a lot, he only waned to figure out why he was leaving the place he called home. I really love how his character was developed, he was hard to dislike. The story itself was touching and unforgettable, it had a really good storyline with the story being told beautifully. It is fairly easy to get caught up with the story and not think about the historical relevancy.It was a pleasant read, definitely plan to read more books by Boyne.", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["kindle-prime-electronic"]}, {"book_id_title": "1754278.The_Boy_in_the_Striped_Pyjamas", "book_id": "1754278", "book_title": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/123350852", "review_id": "123350852", "date": "Sep 25, 2010", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Sonia Gomes", "user_url": "/user/show/1948955-sonia-gomes", "text": "I know there is so much criticism about this book.Yes there is so much which sounds crazy, Fury for Der Fuhrer, Outwith for Auschwitz , these sound stupid for the boy who naturally speaks German. But I think the end makes up for all the stupidity and naivete.Can you truly imagine the son of a high ranking German officer and a malnourished Jewish boy dying together in a Gas Chamber and that too loving each other. Gives me the goose bumps.The amazing part and the core of this book is their innocent friendship, and their death as Friends. They just saw themselves as Good Friends, that is enough to show that Friendship transcends everything, race, colour of the skin and all those terrible prejudices we harbour in our hearts.", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["good-but-not-fantastic", "heartbreaking", "world-war-ii", "holocaust"]}]
