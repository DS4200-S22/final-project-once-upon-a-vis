EliotWarning: Contains spoilers.The Amber Spyglass is the final volume in His Dark Materials trilogy.I really enjoyed Northern Lights (or The Golden Compass as it is titled in the US), the first volume of the trilogy. Pullman introducted us to a fantastic world of great scope. It was suspenseful, the presented world was enchanting, and Northern Lights was pregnant with interesting ideas and concepts - that's why I chose to read all three.The next one, The Subtle Knife was laborious indeed. Most of what made Northern Lights wonderful was dropped - there was no world building in this volume, the characters seemed stalled and the book was a chore. It was a transitional piece so some of these things might be excused, and I approached the final installment expecting a grand payoff.The Amber Spyglass is no Return of The King. It's the ugly baby that came out of Pullman's imagination and his hatred of religion. The novels is such a tremendous let-down that it's hard to decide where to start a list of its failings.Lyra, the cocky and bratty protagonist of Northern Lights disappears almost entirely. Lyra from The Amber Spyglass is almost fullly submissive to Will. Oh Will! What shall we do? Will! Oh Will! Where is the girl who rescued children and planned it all on her own? Here Lyra doesn't seem to be able to do anything without depending on Will.The \"redemption\" of Mrs. Coulter is totally unconvincing. The Grand Evil Lady (who was so great in Northern Lights!) suddenly out of the blue starts loving Lyra. This is just so ridiculously uncharacteristic and unbelieveable. The great villain is reduced to a mere puppet in Pullman's hands, who seems to have forgotten how to hold the strings.Not that other characters are handled expertly. Aside from Lyra who was reduced to a dependand sissy and Will, the grand young adult fiction boy-on-a-quest stereotype Pullman introduces more and more characters like the new race of Mulefa, the bug-like creatures. He then goes on a tangent describing their culture, which while interesting doesn't add much to the plot.The figure of Father Gomez, who is sent by the Church to kill Lyra is just a cheap way of maintaing tension. He never faces his victim and dies from the hand of a character we believed to be dead several hundred pages previously. His sections are nothing but filler.The theological questions are never developed. Pullman literally stated in the previous volume that \"every Church is evil\", without showing why. He didn't show how Chuch uses religion to manipulate the consciences of people - we are treated only to Pullman's version of the Church, which is evil because the author told us it's evil. Everyone associated with Church is EVIL at a cartoonish level. Mother Theresa has evaporated from Pullman's cosmos, and took all the good priests along with her.There's no conflict inside the Magisterium - no good voices are drowned by the bad ones - because everyone is bad. All of these evils are dressed in the not-at-all veiled robes of Christianity, especially the Catholic Church. These evils are never really shown, we're just told they are evil. Oddly, there are no evil Muslim priest or bomb-throwing Buddhist monks. In Pullman's world there is only one religion, and it is THE BAD ONE. As one of the characters says: \"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\"Doesn't sound very convincing.Curiously, the church seems to have little impact on Lyra's world. Though Pullman wants to lay all of the evil of mankind on Christian religion and God he doesn't bother with providing plenty of evidence. The Church does evil things, but it doesn't get into the way of the Armored Polar Bears who live a godless existence, or the clans of Witches who are into paganism. Neither the Polar Bears nor the Witches seem to be particularly bothered by the Evil church - The Witches seem to love their country, and don't seem to be forced or isolated by the church. They seem to love the north pole where they live.Now, in a world dominated by an incredibly powerful religious organization which corrupts everything, one would expect that everyone would be forced to follow the enforced religion and actively participate in its rituals - masses, etc. Religion would be a part of the daily life, as vital as a breath when you practice it, and as deadly as lack of it when your faith is not strong.In Lyra's world, NO ONE prays or goes to any sort of religious service. In a world where religious domination is SAID TO BE thriving, I'd expect it to be obvious. If religion is the source of all the evil in the world I expected it to be omnipresent. But it isn't. Except Pullman said so. So we have to believe him, eh?Pullman goes on a specific tangent to discuss the very issue of God. God is said not to be the original creator, but the first of the angels to appear. He portras him as some sort of terrorist, who lied about his origins and holds the reins of Heaven in his strong hands. However, it is all told to us; we never see it played out. When God makes an appearance, he is shown to be a demented, old angel which vanishes almost immediately. We are never shown the man behind the curtain, the malevolent presence who is the source of all trouble. We are supposed to accept, that no matter what THIS is TRUE and REAL. Is \"God\" a sadist? We may never known, we can only accept what Pullman tells us, because he showes his truth down our throats.The angels are shown as extremely ineffectual. They can't really hurt anything, which makes us think again: How exactly did \"God\", who is just the first angel, become so powerful? There are many more questions about the angels (how did Baruch and Metatron became angels from men, but no one else did?) but Pullman never bothers with them.Then there is the separate tangent of dr Mary Mallone, a former nun who rejected the Church and all faith entirely because she ate some marzipan and kissed an Italian. Whoa! Maybe if she ate an Italian and kissed the marzipan I could understand the Church denouncing her (the convent would grow slimmer and slimmer) but it doesn't make much sense. In fact this is some of the poorest reasoning I've read in a while. Can't you believe in God, practive your faith and enjoy the world at the same time? Millions of people do, but Pullman apparently think you can't. I could understand Mary quitting being a nun, even quitting organized religion because of the \"imposed\" restraints, but stopping believing in God because of marzipan? This is not a strawman argument, it's a marzipanman argument, and unfortunately it ain't sweet.Mary's story stirs some tension in Will and Lyra, who suddenly realize that they're meant for each other (at age of 12 eternal love is serious business, mind you) and the story morphs into a contrived retelling of The Fall of Man, though I don't understand why Lyra is said to be the next Eve. Of course she finds love (with almost no build up), she gives it up for the sake of the worlds (hers and Will's). I think she resists the temptation to continue their relationship to help everyone build the new Eden, or the Republic of Heaven, but it's a tenuous connection at best. Not to mention that twelve year old children suddenly start talking like certain older men. Blah.This is getting long, so I'll wrap it up in Pullman fashion. An angel shows up, answers all of the questions and the children return to their separate worlds, promising that they will never forget each other and visit the same place in their worlds to remains as close as possible. In Lyra's world generous foster parents magically turn up, and she sets up to build a godless existence where people could enjoy themselves as if anything was stopping them before. DOH! I think that these books had great potential. They could show children the dangers of corrupt individuals who use religion to influence and control people. Unfortunately, Pullman took it all away with his absolute lack of polemic and blatant one-sideness and all we got were some puppets running around and spewing his personal sentiments in this incredibly boring and contrived slog. The guy's obviously an imaginative author, but his bigotry got the better of him here and I can only wish that Norhtern Lights was a standalone.", "num_likes": 674, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["reviewed", "the-ya-shelf", "own-in-paperback", "read-in-2011", "fantasy", "journeys-and-quests", "owned-books"]}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/683662337", "review_id": "683662337", "date": "Aug 01, 2013", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Jayson", "user_url": "/user/show/22106879-jayson", "text": "(A-) 83% | Very GoodNotes: A sad but necessary ending; its exceptional last chapters may have seemed unconvincing if penned by a lesser writer.", "num_likes": 561, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["500-599-pp", "author-british", "read-in-2007", "genre-juvenile-fantasy", "read-in-2010", "genre-anthropomorphic", "subject-religion", "subject-parallel-universe", "genre-young-adult", "genre-steampunk"]}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/12935061", "review_id": "12935061", "date": "Jan 19, 2008", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Paul", "user_url": "/user/show/621240-paul", "text": "Okay....first...make no mistake, this review contains spoilers. Now, having read the first book (5 stars) and the second book (3 stars) I had some hope for this book. But, this book was an excruciating head-hammering look at an author making all the wrong moves. 1: Lyra's sublimation to Will becomes utterly complete. Hell, women are supposed to bend to men, aren't they? Lyra quit taking a step without fearing it would cause Will to raise his eyebrow. 2: Lyra's mother (who had been SUCH a wonderfully evil character) and father both find ultimate redemption in their love for Lyra. Whoopee. In fact, EVERYBODY finds redemption in this novel. Everybody. The evilest creatures in existence, the harpies in the lands of the dead, are transformed by Lyra's music in about 3 pages, and become her stalwart and forever allies. Cripes. 3: Lyra and Will gettin' it on! Yeah, hello? We knew from point one that Lyra and Will would eventually get busy...did it have to be Sex That Saves the Universe? Cosmic Humping That Restores the Fabric of All Reality? Wait, was I supposed to be taking LSD when I read that part? Damn, dude, you should have packaged a tab with the book!4: More damn characters. More damn MAIN characters. Suddenly we've got Important People on Bugs. Pullman continues to pull in so many disparate characters and plot threads that EVERYTHING is diluted into a big stinky morass. 5: Theology aspect. One of the reasons I was attracted to this series was because of Pullman's strongly anti-religious take...the man wrote a blurb for Dawkins' \"God Delusion\" for freak's sake. So, umm, why was this book sooooo religious? The dust? Well, the dust is all-knowing, even of the future. And there is indeed a land of the dead. So, we have afterlife, and pre-ordainment, in an anti-religious book? Sweet, how does that work? Well, it doesn't. Angels are flying around, and they're the good guys. No, wait, they're the bad guys. Well, no matter, I mean, there IS a god, but he didn't make all creation. That was, apparently, maybe, the dust. Seems to me that if you're praying to dust, rather than God, it doesn't make any difference. Religion is religion, and this was a religious book. 6: Easy ending. Okay...I saw most aspects of the ending coming from about 700 pages to go. Couldn't Pullman throw me some surprises beyond How Damn Long He Took to Get Around To It?7: Easy ending, take 2: Let's see, Will and Lyra fight against God and All the Angels, against the pull of their own daemons, against not only all creation, but all of creation on multiple universes, they lose friends to bullets, explosions, souls ripped out, and a myriad other ways as legions of people die to either protect them personally, or what they stand for, the two of them travel to the freakin' Lands of the Dead in order to remain together, and they eventually get it on in all sorts of transcendant-garden-of-eden ways, restoring the entire multi-verse with the Glory of Their Hot Sweaty Action, and then....and then...and then an angel says, \"Oh, you guys can't stay together, cuz a some bad stuff would happen then.\"And in ONE PAGE they say, \"Jeepers, that's too bad. Any way around it?\"Angel says \"Nope.\"And they don't even try. It's just ta-ta, been good knowing you. That's it. Well, trilogy, it actually hasn't been so good knowing you.

But I feel compelled to continue. At one point, I actually stopped reading \"The Amber Spyglass,\" put it down and vowed not to finish, but I wanted to be able to slag off the book with authority, so finishing became a must. And I even had a slight hope that Pullman could save his seriesI did finish, but it never got any better. Mulefa? Gallivespians? Iorek Byrnison fixing the incredibly fragile subtle knife? The knife breaking at all? Mrs. Coulter continuing to live? The incredible coincidence of everyone meeting the same Citt\u00e0gazze kids? It was all too much, and it only got worse as the book went on. Thematically it was equally frustrating. There has been so much talk about Pullman's anti-religiosity, but the most offensive part of The Amber Spyglass is Pullman's portrayal of women. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Pullman is a misogynist , but he does seem to have a poor understanding of women.The five main women in \"His Dark Materials\" are a catalogue of feminine stereotypes. Lyra, as her name so clumsily suggests, is a consummate liar, who eventually becomes a moony-eyed, love sick teen, subordinating herself to her lover Will. Mrs. Coulter is a manipulative femme fatale whose only hint of goodness is her inexplicable maternal instinct. Mary Malone is the pure ex-nun full of kindness and curiosity, blessedly open to all new things. Seraphina Pekkala, the loyal witch, is the classic \"heart of gold\" character (usually she'd be a whore with a heart of gold, but in a kids book witch with a heart of gold will do). Then there is Mrs. Parry, Will's mom, and her madness (other women appear in the story more, but they're not as important as Will's mom). There are few if any shades of gray in these women, and as the book drew ever nearer the close I found myself hoping desperately for the women to do something unexpected. My wish went unfulfilled.Maddening, frustrating, and a great disappointment because of what it promised, China Mieville got it right when he made his list of 50 books every good Marxist should read and said, \"in book three, 'The Amber Spyglass,' something goes wrong. It has excellent bits, it is streets ahead of its competition\u2026 but there's sentimentality, a hesitation, a formalism, which lets us down.\"On second thought, Mieville was too nice. \"The Amber Spyglass\" should be avoided like a plate of raw chicken meat on a hot African day.

So I read the whole series over the next couple years, and in this process discovered that one of my English department\u2019s medievalists said it was one of his favorite series. Did I know, he asked, that Pullman was actually in conversation with John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost as he wrote the series, which came to be called His Dark Materials (the title from Milton), particularly in The Amber Spyglass? Nope, I said, I had had no idea, so I paid some attention to that aspect of the book as I read it. A little attention, I say, because I am no Milton scholar, and how many are who would be reading it? Nor had I read more than the sections of Paradise Lost I had read in the survey Brit lit course I had taken decades ago.Now, many years later, I and my family have invested some 37 hours listening to the audio version CDs of His Dark Materials narrated by Pullman himself. Last summer, the first book, The Golden Compass, last fall the second in the series, The Subtle Knife, and now the third, The Amber Spyglass. Which I loved, and then I find that one of the Goodreads reviewers I much respect hated this series, and a little Goodreads argument through his highly critical review ensued. So I at one point read his review and the subsequent hubbub, mostly pushback on him from Pullman fans. I went back and looked at his review to see if I might, on reflection, change my mind. I did review the book and disagree with him, as will happen here, obviously. I learned from that review, but I still think it\u2019s a great book. And reread this review in November 2017 as I wait for my family copy of Pullman's fall 2017 release, The Book of Dust, that is part of this world.One place to start in thinking of this book is that Pullman, unlike C.S. Lewis, another prominent fantasy writer, is as he refers to himself, \u201can atheist, or agnostic atheist.\u201d Lewis, a Christian, once an outspoken atheist, recounts his sudden epiphany of faith in Surprised by Joy. This review is being written by an agnostic once raised in the Calvinist (Dutch) Christian Reformed Church. I not only know that tradition, but actually taught in Christian schools, even taught classes on the Bible in them for a couple years. I say that not to establish credibility on theological/religious issues Pullman explores here, but because sometimes you read a book more through your life, \u201csubjectively,\u201d than you might read other books. I am pretty familiar with some of the territory Pullman treads. Theological issues, in a children\u2019s book? Well, this children\u2019s book thing, that\u2019s marketing, according to Pullman. He intended to have adults\u2014all ages\u2014read this trilogy, too. And we should, and we do. Since in many ways he is commenting on Christian/spiritual traditions as they are evident in literature, Pullman wants to be in conversation with people who have read John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost and/or C. S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia Chronicles, two of the best known epics in the history of English literature. His Dark Materials is also an epic novel series, but it is, like much literature, talking in various ways to the authors whose literature that it is built on. You don\u2019t need to have read those works, for real, but it doesn\u2019t hurt, either.In this case, Pullman has written a version of Paradise Lost, an inversion of the central arc of that tale. Milton seemed to claim, in keeping with the Calvinist tradition, that the single terrible shaping moment in human history was the invention of the myth of \u201coriginal sin\u201d\u2014a sexual sin\u2014of Adam and Eve. Satan, an angel who fell from Heaven, engineers this act. In Amber Spyglass, Pullman has Mary \u201ctempt\u201d Lyra through her story of falling in love. Lyra \u201cgives in\u201d to this temptation as she realizes she loves Will (though the American publisher amazingly cut some of the details of Lyra\u2019s physical responses to being with Will!).Pullman thinks the Church got it wrong from the beginning and throughout history in obsessively focusing on sexuality as \u201csinful\u201d. To split the body from the soul as he suggests Christianity does is for Pullman a horrible, horrible mistake. Materiality is a good thing, Pullman says; the Earth should not be seen as a temporary place to wait until you get to the really good place, Heaven, but a place where we should fully, existentially, engage. \u201cD\u00e6mons\u201d are a cool aspect of this story, sort of spirit companions, usually in the shape of animals or birds, and all humans have them, like souls, and when you are young they can shift. It's a kind of identity conceit, as identity in youth is in flux, in construction. As Pullman sees it, The Church wants to separate you from your (individualized; think of it as a personal relationship to the spiritual realm, or God) d\u00e6mon, metaphorically, and this is a horrible thing, in Pullman\u2019s view. Pullman also thinks the Church\u2014and specifically the Roman Catholic Church, though almost all Christian theology is pretty consistent\u2014in deciding their binary view of good and evil is the \u201cright\u201d one, is narrow and simplistic. His view\u2014in part supported by contemporary physics\u2014is that there are multiple spiritual worlds and traditions, all of which should be supported and celebrated. Pullman favors diversity of all kinds\u2014spiritual, cultural, biological. We are different and interdependent or we expire as a human race. His key central concept for a deeper relationship to the universe is \u201cdust\u201d which would seem to be a synonym for consciousness, or wisdom, though it is potentially also visible in the natural world with the right attitude (and/or a Steam Punkish instrument, such as is the Amber Spyglass). Instead of Christianity's idea of One All-Powerful God, Pullman flips that script to show us the limitation of that view through the specter of The Authority, who is frail, weak, sniveling, small-minded, associated with a bad group from the Church called The Magisterium who wants to control your minds and souls and bodies. Ultimately the series is about growing up in the face of an oppressive adult religious soul-killing authority. We need more connection to the natural world than Christianity seems to have fostered, Pullman insists. And we need more joy and a spirit of adventure and discovery and imagination than the Church would seem to have given us. We need to stop thinking our bodies and the material world are somehow just merely bad.So is Pullman\u2019s view anti-Christian, or anti-spiritual? I don\u2019t think so, not really. He\u2019s about expanding spiritual horizons rather than getting rid of them. And he knows how to have fun, in this rollicking adventure. And he loves Milton, too, though he disagrees with him. He just prefers William Blake\u2019s more complex cosmology. The epigraphs before every chapter are wonderful, perfect, a guide to the argument that is coiled deeply in his story. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, endorsed the series, calling the books instructive, saying they are in fact about the death of a false God and the upholding of true Christian values. Williams even went so far as to say that Pullman\u2019s series should be taught in schools. Fundamentalists, needless to say, do not agree. But the imagination is key to spiritual health for Pullman. He does not think most religions value imagination.In this final volume Lyra and Will travel to the World of the Dead to visit Roger, and Will\u2019s father, which is maybe the single most powerful sequence of the whole series. Along the way, assumptions about the good or evil of individual characters of the book are questioned. Is Mrs. Coulter, Lyra\u2019s mother, evil? Is Lord Asriel good? What are the limitations of such categories? Lyra is a liar, which is a good thing in some situations; fiction is a wonderful and useful adaptive strategy in the world, but lies, or false stories, can also be hurtful. Will is a good guy, but he also kills people. The Magisterium has sent Father Gomez to kill Lyra and Will; he seems closer to a completely bad guy than almost anyone in this tale, but even he claims to want the best for kids. The former nun and physicist Mary Malone is a pretty good person, a guide for Will and Lyra in the absence of The Magisterum. Iorok Byrnison, the flying armored bear who has special capabilities with metal-working, once a (captive) drunk, is a great and mostly good character. I prefer the sheer imaginative joy of the first volume, The Golden Compass, with its strong girl character Lyra; she shares the stage with boy Will in the later two books. The last book is less a children\u2019s book than the first, and it\u2019s more serious, a little less fun. But the last book is powerful, and often moving. Who wouldn\u2019t want to have one final talk with those we love who have died? The plot in this last book sort of rambles slowly along, contemplative and reflective as it intends to be. After being primarily an adventure story, The Amber Spyglass slows down and helps resolve all the central issues. But I still truly loved it. I maybe especially loved it because I heard Pullman's sweet and loving and gentle voice on tape shape the narration, as well as all the wonderful characters read by great actors, so well acted.Pullman also has a bone to pick with C. S. Lewis, whose fantasy children\u2019s series The Narnia Chronicles I grew up loving. Pullman told The New York Times in 2000: \u201cWhen you look at what C.S. Lewis is saying, his message is so anti-life, so cruel, so unjust. The view that the Narnia books have for the material world is one of almost undisguised contempt. At one point, the old professor says, \u2018It\u2019s all in Plato\u2019 \u2014 meaning that the physical world we see around us is the crude, shabby, imperfect, second-rate copy of something much better. I want to emphasize the simple physical truth of things, the absolute primacy of the material life, rather than the spiritual or the afterlife.\u201d I loved growing up (in the bosom of a Calvinist church!) reading The Narnia Chronicles, and I don't recall all the harshness to which Pullman refers, but I read it when I was steeped in that theology. So he may have a point there.Pullman argues finally, for embracing a \u201crepublic of heaven\u201d here on Earth. This is Blake--and not Milton-- talking through Pullman, advocating a pluralistic way of life and not a monotheistic religion. Be God where you are, Pullman says. Pullman\u2019s view is closer to Buddhism, and the I Ching and existentialist Christianity (think Kierkegaard). Renounce (the One) or False God, he says, and instead Be God, which as I see it is one interpretation of what Christianity is saying a Christian ought to become. No guru, no teacher, as Van Morrison sings. In the end, Lyra, having lost her ability to read the alethiometer intuitively, decides to return to Oxford to study alethiometry, which might just be another word for how Pullman sees fantasy, as the narrative exploration of multiple worlds and dimensions and truths. In the end, Lyra and her d\u00e6mon Pantalaimon, who has taken the permanent form of a pine marten, resolve to build the republic of Heaven on Earth. In the light of the ongoing destruction of the planet, this is a hopeful vision of how we should be living the spiritual life, honoring the environment.", "num_likes": 171, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "books-loved-2016"]}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/444030983", "review_id": "444030983", "date": "Oct 29, 2012", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "user_url": "/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "text": "The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, #3), Philip Pullman His Dark Materials is an epic trilogy of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman consisting of Northern Lights (1995, published as The Golden Compass in North America), The Subtle Knife (1997), and The Amber Spyglass (2000).

https://youtu.be/-3aD5b4j5ro Plus meet my daemon (I mean cat)!#1 Philip Pullman fan here! So how is Mr. Pullman going to pull together the entire His Dark Materials Trilogy? We will find out.Some have said that the pacing is a bit off in this book; however, please keep in mind that Philip Pullman wrote this book back before the internet, before YouTube, before Smart phones. That being said the first 150 pages were a bit slow but definitely worth the wait. Lyra and team are simply delightful. Pullman should write a book about how an author can make you care about characters because I felt so personally invested in Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon. Please note that there is simply a DELIGHTFUL audiobook of Pullman reading The Amber Spyglass so make sure to check that out.The Amber Spyglass felt like it came out of my dreams. Pullman is seriously the Mr. Miyagi of writing. Well done, Pullman! Next time I am in London, we should have a tea.

You were having a nightmare. - Mmmn.- Hey, you're shaking. Come over here. It's alright. Do you want to tell me about it?- Ann Coulter and Satan jump into the void and pull him down with them. The evil archangel.- I'm sorry?- Ah, it doesn't make much sense, does it? But it did in the dream. It was even noble and tragic. I think.- What else happened?- Well, I know I shouldn't have stayed up reading that physics book. There was something about dark matter and angels. I think angels were dark matter? But they weren't dark when you looked at them in the right way. I built a sort of telescope and I could see them.- You should have come to bed with me. Remember that next time.- I will! And, ah, let me see, God lived in a Calabi-Yau manifold...- A what?- One of those twisty six-dimensional shapes that string theorists like. I showed you a picture, right?- Oh yes, now I know what you mean. So God's in his... whatever... and all is well with the world?- No, he's tired and he has some kind of accident. That was a good thing though.- You're still not making any sense.- I know, I know! And they can't ever see each other again. They're in different branes. That was so sad.- Different brains?- Branes. B-R-A-N-E-S. You know, parallel universes floating in multi-dimensional space. Anyway, he has to return to his brane and he's lost her forever.- George, try to go back to sleep.

Chronicles was a wonderful adventure AND a clear religious allegory. Golden Compass is a wonderful adventure AND a lesson in not blindly following faith - with the ultimate lesson that a person can still find their own personal way to faith & spirituality. i think that is a good lesson for kids. for everyone!", "num_likes": 118, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy-modern", "inbetweenworld"]}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/58961856", "review_id": "58961856", "date": "Jun 09, 2009", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Porter", "user_url": "/user/show/173638-porter", "text": "When I was in high school, the local video arcade passed out fliers that that evening, after a $2 admission, you could play all the video games for free.

I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil it for you because the ending is so endearing and\u2026..lasting, that I would HATE to take it away from you. I absolutely fell in love with Lyra. Didn\u2019t you? She was the sister I wish I would have had growing up. She was myself as I played with all of my brothers in the mudfields, she was the daughter I\u2019m sure every woman would yearn to have. In my opinion, Philip Pullman was brilliant in his creation of this little girl. Her flaws were her strength just as much as her strengths were her salvation. And when you take her inquisitive innocence and throw in Will\u2019s brave maturity\u2026..together, the two of them are almost too much to bear. I was heady with adoration for the two of them combined. I\u2019m sure some would say they were too perfect together, too sappy, too trite. But my cynicism runs deep and my heart was still touched. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a girl or because my heart still remembers the depth of that first love. The absoluteness of it. My heart remembers \u201cGoing to China\u201d, (haa haa) and it longs to visit again. Will was the boy every girl wants to fall in love with. Loyal, strong, clever, honest, sweet and faithful. I hated him for agreeing to close every single window except one, but loved him for his dedication to do what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d. I wanted to shake him and tell him that when he gets older he will realize that one more window wouldn\u2019t have mattered \u2013 that what he was at Lyra\u2019s side was worth one silly little window in the fabric of the worlds. But of course, he wouldn\u2019t listen to me, because he is young and doesn\u2019t know how rare True Love is. So I sighed (and cried) and watched them (felt them!) split forever. And I agonized over whether they would ever figure out how to Astral Project into eachother's lives. And if the one would wait for the other when they died, so that they could walk out the window they created hand in hand. I could literally picture them sitting there on that bench for an hour each year, aching for eachother once again. Sigh....I liked how Mrs. Coulter was deep enough to be both intrinsically evil and love Lyra with a blindly, maternal love in the end. I liked how the Master at Jordon and John Faa were father figures in their own ways. I liked little Roger\u2019s complete faith and how Iorek\u2019s devotion was tempered with a knowledge that was higher than either of the children\u2019s. I did find Mary Malone unbearably boring and found myself wishing away any chapter having to deal with her and her mulefa. Get back to the real story of Lyra and Will! I could have done without her entire story line.And of course there was Pantalaimon. How much do we all wish we had a d\u00e6mon that we could see, touch, talk to, rely on? How much fun would it be to have a morphing little partner in everything we do? Ahhh, was a fun concept to explore and probably the very secret to HDM\u2019s success. Pullman\u2019s descriptions of the different d\u00e6mon\u2019s throughout each book were descriptive, imaginative and comical. All in all, an excellent book. I wish I would have read it slower so that I could have enjoyed Lyra and Will's company a little longer.

I\u2019ve been truly terrified to read it for such a long time. The first book, The Golden Compass, is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. I adore it. The second book is something else entirely. I was horrified when I read it and truly disgusted with the unexpected direction the series took. I did not want to read this one because I did not want my memories of the first book shattered completely. So I finally picked it up and I approached it expecting to hate the thing. I expected it to be worse than the second book, but my expectations were unfounded. The biggest problem this trilogy has is the fact that it\u2019s not really a trilogy. It\u2019s essentially one big book, one story. Each book is not self-contained but needs to be read in sequence; they are not structured like individual books: the story keeps flowing to the last page. And this book, whilst nowhere near the same level of mastery the first book possessed, was not entirely bad. It managed to piece everything together quite nicely, but this series had the potential to do so much more. I was delighted with the first book, for many reasons. One of the main things that impressed me was the strength of its protagonist. She\u2019s a very young girl who is very much human. She is not a messiah figure and was prone to make mistakes but she was also capable of moments of real brilliance. I rooted for her. I wanted to see her grow and conquer those that would seek to use her for their own ends. She had power in her. With the introduction of Will she took a backseat in the story, he became the main hero and overshadowed her completely. She seemed happy to follow his lead and became subservient to his decisions. This was a big mistake. Whilst Will did actually develop some personality in this book, it was at the tragic cost of Lyra\u2019s. Pullman seemed unable to balance the two personalities together without one unfortunately dominating the other. And the ending they pushed towards was so very (how shall I put this?) closed. It was not the ending this series needed. I feel that Pullman sacrificed the situation he had blooming to fit the writing into the allegory he had been devising since the first book. It became too forced, one the story would have been much stronger if it was allowed to breathe and go where it needed to go.  The redemptive themes towards the end seemed drastically out of place. Two characters that clearly didn\u2019t care much unexpectedly had a change of heart. I found it a little unbelievable. You may wonder why I even bothered to give it three stars. I\u2019m wondering that myself. I think a lot of it has to do with Iorek Byrnison. He was in the last book, and his presence here helped pull the story up in my estimation.

Way too much.Pullman's series concludes like it started. Good but nothing great. And tiring. Very. The Amber Spyglass weighs as much as the other two books put together....and then some. Pullman pulls in still MORE main characters and still MORE beings and still MORE complications and still MORE unlikely, unbelievable turns-of-event. It just got to be too much. Between the witches and the angels and the cliff-ghasts, the shadows, the specters, the ghosts, the Gallivespians, the armored bears....you come away feeling tha the author is trying to beat you over the head.And yet, you cant stop turning the pages. It is well-written, suspensful and you just cant help wanting to know what happens next. Thus the extra star.The vast assortment of characters and beings would be fine if it hadnt detracted from the well-crafted main characters of the first book. Mrs. Coulter becomes less of a player and less interesting by the page. The same with Asriel and...characters that should have been better fleshed out and worthy of the weight they carried in this war (The President, Father Gomez, Metatron...)were left virtually unknown.Most maddening was Lyra. She began the series as an admirable, sympathetic, tough little woman-to-be; a wonderful, powerful heroine driven to do what was right. By the end of the series her subservience to the boy Will is complete. The woman must bow before the man. This book is much too full of \"Oh Will! What will we do Will?\" followed by her sobbing and Will saving the day. I found that very chauvenistic and quite a turn off.Still, the ideas of the book are interesting - but not earth shattering. What initially drew me to this series was that the Christians are busy crying about how this series and the movie based on the books are going to corrupt our children and kill God and wreck havoc on our peaceable society. Laughable to say the least.Understanding that this book was geared towards young teens, I still couldnt help but think that any teen who had not had these doubts or questions or wonderment about God should be tossed out in the snow. Many of the \"anti-God\" things in this book were things my friends and were arguing about over cases of Miller Genuine Draft in Stephanie Montez's basement. There's nothing new here.So I dont understand the fuss. In fact, there is only one atheist character in the book, Mary Malone and she felt and empetiness and a loss without her connection to God. I found her rejection of the Church odd. She ate marzipan and kissed an Italian. Whoa! I ate roasted chesnuts and kissed a Colombian once but it didnt make me an atheist. Cant we believe in God and enjoy the world at the same time? Pullman seems not to think so. Therefore there is something ironic about the near heavenly place Dr. Malone finds herself stranded (in fact, the mulefas, thier trees and wheels and her relationship with them was the most interesting part of the book).In any case, Pullman doesnt say that there is no God. In fact, he allows that there may be a creator, a greater force but the war isnt against God. The war is against the supposed Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal dictatorship run by an angel who wields power through the Church. What is atheistic about that? Nothing. What drives the Christians nuts is that the books but the very valid question in the reader's mind...who does The Church 'work' for? If you arent or havent asked yourself that question you too should be chucked out in the snow. Here, the Church clearly works for a corrupt and evil angel and considering little things like the Crusades and the Inquistion...not to mention the insane theocratic drive of our current President and candidate Huckabee...Pullman may have hit it on the head.

Everything I loved about the first book is completely gone, the author seems to have forgotten that he's telling a story rather than railing against organized religion almost non-stop, the characters seem to have been lobotomized, and it was just long, horribly boring, and extremely anti-climactic. It drags on, and on, and on, and really accomplishes very little, does not deliver on any of the promises made by the first book, and for a book about man killing god there's remarkably little god killing going on here. Come on Pullman, if you're going to have a man start a war with god, GO FOR THE GOLD, MAN. Go for some huge and epic confrontations, gigantic, world-shattering battles, Man screaming defiance in God's face. You know, something... ANYTHING other than a largely undescribed and frankly boring battle scene that takes up a chapter or so and ends with one of the most ridiculous and melodramatic suicides I've ever read of in fiction. Lord Asriel falls far short of his goal, and has to settle for killing God's underling. Mary Malone's side story is just completely pointless and only serves to take up space. A lot of space. While also managing to be completely uninteresting in every way on top of it. And the ending just drags on, and on pointlessly and impotently long after it should have wrapped things up and called it quits, but Pullman, it seems, just had to squeeze in a few more sermons.At the end it really seems like Pullman wanted to tell a huge and epic tale, but had no idea how to go about doing it, so he substituted rant after rant, and allegory after allegory instead, and these things were nowhere near as entertaining, or well reasoned out as he obviously thinks them to be. What started out as a very fun fantasy story with a great protagonist, truly menacing villains, and a highly inventive and interesting world became a pretentious, thinly strung together collection of lectures on the evils of organized religion held up on cue cards by stick figures that are sort of dressed like the characters in the first book. I'm very disappointed. There is a way to share your beliefs if you want to and still tell a good and entertaining story. Look at  Faith of the Fallen by Terry Goodkind for example. You don't have to sacrifice one for the other. Pullman, unfortunately, didn't realize this. This book was long, boring, pointless, and worst of all, highly disappointing. Perhaps it's a good thing that only the first book got made into a movie. I don't even know how the other two books would even be adapted into movies. It's so sad that it had to end this way. The first book was just soooooo good. What a waste. I don't think there was even a single part of this book that I actually enjoyed reading.I kept waiting for the author to put his dick away and get back to telling the story, but he never did. He just left it hanging out there in the wind as he stands upon his great and shining soapbox of justice... as foretold by prophecy... Yes, there are many arguments that can be made against any religion. And many of them have valid points. \"Religion is bad *drops mike*\" is not one of them. That's a four year old's argument, Pullman, you can do better than that, and you should be ashamed of yourself for not doing so. The biggest problem with this book is that Pullman didn't actually make, or prove any of his own points. He ranted against the evils of religion without ever actually naming what any of said evils are, saying how they impact the world and its people, and why he thinks they are evil. You know, how a well thought out argument would be put together? Pullman pretty much just says that religion is evil because reasons. If, in the end, your entire argument can be summarized by the two words \"because reasons\", you've failed to make an argument. Go back and try again. It's like he just likes to rant for the sake of ranting, rather than toward any sort of goal or purpose. I really don't mind if he wants to share his beliefs with me if it's in a well thought out and delivered way, while not forgetting that he's also telling a story. But that's not what this book is. It's not that I disagree with the argument that made me hate this book, it's how incompetently he delivered it that makes me hate it. I'm all for people having their own opinions and sharing them. But, you know, at least TRY to make a good showing of it when you do. Pathetic. Just plain pathetic. And by the end of it, I don't think even the author knows what Dust is actually supposed to be. He seems to change his mind on that pretty regularly throughout the trilogy, and, well, he just sort of hand waves it away as \"meh whatever, it's not like the driving force of the first book is in any way important, you'd much rather hear about how Catholicism is the creation of hell, right?\" It's just an arbitrary point of contention that has no meaning, definition, or purpose in the story except to be a vague, unexplained point of contention. And on top of that, any point you want to make in your book should never be so oppressive that it crushes all of the life, personality, enjoyability, and sense right out of the story. It should go hand in hand with the story, and work together with it to make a better whole in the end, rather than being the main focus of the book to the exclusion of every single thing else. And that's just not what happened here. He got a bug up his ass about making his point, and it became so heavy handed and oppressive that it utterly destroyed everything else in the story. Hugely disappointing. I went into this book wanting more of what I saw in the first book, but the author didn't really seem to care to finish that story, because he was too busy going off on rant after rant. I get it dude, you don't believe in god and you think organized religion does more harm than good. Did you have to beat me over the head with it until I see cartoon stars circling me? Let's put it another way. What did Lyra and Will learn during the course of the book? How are they better people in the end than they were at the beginning? What did they accomplish, and how will it affect anything? I can't answer these questions, because the author was too focused on preaching to me that he forgot to include something so simple, yet completely vital to a story, as basic character development in the book. Here's just one small example of the sheer incompetence in storytelling here. Remember how Mrs. Colter had complete control over all the Specters? That sure was awesome, wasn't it? Yeah, too bad the author didn't remember that. And that is just one of many, many, many abandoned, aborted, or just plain forgotten plotlines that the author ignored so that he could better spend his time preaching. In essence, Pullman is exactly what he despises most. Some asshole so full of himself that he won't stop preaching long enough to take a look at the world around him. Funny, eh?Oh yeah, and 12 year old true love? Yeah... bullshit.And to be clear, I am not bothered in the least by anti-religious sentiments. Other people are allowed to believe what they believe, and their doing so has no impact whatsoever upon what I believe. I AM bothered by incompetent idiots who wouldn't know how to put together a real and sound argument if their lives depended on it, and think that they're being very clever whilst completely failing to validate said argument in any way. I'm also bothered by assholes who try to pass off a rant on |<---Insert Topic Here--->| as a story, and writers who don't know the first thing about plot structure or character development.

Even the Jungian Daemons, anima and animus to every character, have their counterparts in Blake, while the sexual awakening of Lyra and Will prompted by Mary Malone's fond musings about Marzipan is the fruit of Milton's conception of Adam and Eve in Eden.Three paths are open to me at this stage. The reinterpretation of Milton by means of Blake by Pullman, His Dark Materials as anti-Narnia, and the trilogy as a profoundly religious work written by a non-believer. All of these together place Pullman's work in a dialectic relationship with a dissenting Protestant tradition in English literature, these books are part of an ongoing conversation about culture, about Britain, and also about the family and upbringing. If on the one hand Pullman was inspired to reinterpret Milton and Blake then he was also writing in response to C.S. Lewis by writing an anti-Narnia. The world of Narnia is a closed and tightly knit one. We are always in a family circle, family is always sufficient and saves a child from outside influences (so long as you are not a pubescent girl and have no thought of entering into adult sexuality) which are always wicked. Authority is good and directly experienced, although not comprehensible (because Jesus isn't a tame lion for goodness sake). And curiously the most we know about any of the parents in any of the Narnia books is the sickly mother from The Magician's Nephew.Pullman takes an opposite approach. The family is nothing, its influence is weak. The child is open to the world, the world is a place of adventure, foreigners are friends rather than weird people with the wrong skin colour who are incapable of achieving salvation. Authority is fractured, remote, and corrupt. Parents are terrible role models. Witches have joy in the experience of creation, and armoured bears are proper bears who eat people rather than giant honey pawed embarrassing emanations of an Oxford Don's imagination. This is the battlefield for the dream of Oxford and what part it will play in a child's imagination. A battle fought in a culture war between Anglicanism and Dissent. If Anglicanism remains dominant - and I suspect that idea of an Establishment encompassing religious, civil, cultural, and political elites can be read across by readers into their own countries - Dissent still dissents. The down side of this incredible openness and excitement about the universe and all its many varieties of Oxford is that that the series can be diffuse, some characters are much weaker than others despite having important roles to play in the story and more seriously it is hard to take the Authority and The Church seriously as antagonists when we see the heartless cruelty of chief rebel and Miltonic Satan Lord Asriel ultimately aided and abetted by the no less hideous and beautiful Mrs Coulter. While Lyra and Will for me did not emerge as synthesis, or resolution, or an alternative to either, but somehow always remained associated with the child sacrificing Lord Asriel. And what are we to make of a Republic of Heaven established by a Lord! Can the idea of the establishment of a Republic of Heaven move us as readers when the Authority lacks authority in the author's own text, the sprawl out runs the story, in effect we are with Satan at the beginning of book three of Paradise Lost surging through the unformed void where element fights against element in never ending anarchy.But perhaps this is part of Pullman's point. The universes are such incredible places and our lives so exuberant and full of adventure that we can never follow all the possible stories fully. Scheherazade, does Pullman say, did not even come close, her constant digression into other stories which interrupt each other and fall over each others toes to such an extent that there is time for a child to grow to from egg and seed to fullness in her womb before she was half way done with them gives us but a fraction of the idea of potential plot-lines a story could follow. A storyteller must then be a vicious creature, like Blake's Urizen, dividing up the seamless cloth of creation into ugly pockets and then calling himself god. Yet none of this is irreligious. Maybe for some it is an unfamiliar take, but then there is more, even to Christianity, than C.S. Lewis. Pullman's universes are steeped in religion. This is a creation, but just as in Blake's vision the original creator had been displaced by Urizen so too here power has been seized by a Demiurge. The argument is not over the place of religion in the universes but over who controls religion, is faith a matter of personal revelation or of a top down authority, a republic of spiritual equals or an absolute monarchy. A creation in which it is revealed that Dark Matter are Angels cannot be thought of as irreligious or Atheistic without exploding those concepts. What is Lyra and Will's journey to the afterlife than the Harrowing of Hell?The ending came across as apt to me. The initial breach between worlds was an act of huge violence, Will's subsequent movement using The Subtle Knife again is violent, although since he only cuts rather than blows open with a explosion not quite as bad, however still this is no gentle business, it is plainly damaging and destructive. An ending in which these holes in the fabric of existence were not knitted together would have to be unremittingly bleak. The resulting human sorrow is part of Pullman's expansive vision. Here love is inevitable, so long as one can remember the marzipan, it is not something to be feared and rejected, it gifts us the pain of parting the Newtonian opposite to joys of intimacy. For me this vast mixture of elements was hugely exciting. Dark matter and William Blake, Milton and Armoured bears, a joyful expansive approach of life in which actions have cruel consequences which our child protagonists will repent of. Way back in the first book we are told that irrespective of what other characters think or would prefer, they are engaged in a war and will have to fight, the only question is for which side. This may be true in our non-fictional lives, with the important difference that one does not need to turn coat to turn covers and sample what both sides have to offer, and even a child person is a complex thing that needs more than just one type of book to grow well.", "num_likes": 57, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["childrens-ya", "fiction", "21st-century"]}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/24729025", "review_id": "24729025", "date": "Jun 17, 2008", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Rebecca", "user_url": "/user/show/285565-rebecca", "text": "This book was an experiment, and while there were moments that were clever and compelling and emotionally resonant, as a whole, the experiment failed. That experiment was to take a piece of complex, religious poetry intended for adults (Paradise Lost), turn it on its head, and make it into an anti-religion/coming-of-age allegory for children. Even though Pullman ultimately failed to create a believable, subtle, or controlled narrative universe, even The Amber Spyglass did have its good moments.Pullman's writing is still as vivid and engaging as it was in the first two books, and he has a good sense of how to write exciting and suspenseful action scenes. He has a knack for describing landscapes richly (he tends to describe landscapes and nature a bit more than I care for, but that's just my personal preference as a reader), and he has a passion and respect for curiosity that I find admirable. The overall message of the series, as bluntly and childishly as it was delivered, is still a worthwhile and important message to build a book around: to approach the world with vigor and curiosity, to keep an open mind, to do no harm, and to seek the truth no matter how frightening it may be to do so. His vision and goals as an author are praiseworthy, and his skill with language is something that other children's authors can emulate.However, Pullman fails one very important test of novel-writing: his characters are flat. Try as I might, I simply did not care about most of the characters in the story. Lyra was basically a broken record that said things like \"I been thinkin'...let's save them!'\" and \"Let's do the right thing!\" and \"Oh, I got to do this, I got to!\" and \"I ain't the smartest, but by golly am I brave!\" She sounded like a character from Winnie-the-Pooh. \"Let's go lay down by the brambly bush and have some refreshment while we talk about what an ever so exciting and gay time we've had today, making new friends and learning a moral lesson here and there about doing The Right Thing!\" That's not even taking into account the fact that she was a pig-headed brat throughout \u00be of the entire series. It wasn't until a flood of estrogen poured into her system when she spontaneously hit puberty that she finally stopped stamping her foot and listening seriously to the advice and wisdom that adults had to offer.Sure, she and Will were brave and strong and self-sacrificing. But neither of them really developed into anything beyond Pullman's simplistic notion of golden-hearted goodness. Despite all the fuss Pullman made about Lyra being \"tempted,\" she was never really tempted at all. She never had to face a real moral choice about right and wrong: she always knew, with absolute certainty, what was right and what was wrong. Her personality was cloying and saccharine when she wasn't being abrasive and stubborn, and I couldn't stand her. Will was a bit better, but even he failed to live up to my expectations of character development. And if those two \u2013 the main characters \u2013 weren't adequately developed, who else in the series could be? One of the only characters who came anywhere near being interesting and unpredictable was Mrs. Coulter, who was basically a Snape figure, but less plausible and not as much fun to read about. Dr. Malone also had her moments as a developed character, but unfortunately she only made up a small part of the series as a whole.Mrs. Coulter was interesting, but ultimately, no one was able to give a satisfactory reason to explain her change of heart. Maybe she still had the hots for Asriel, maybe her maternal instinct kicked in 12 years too late, maybe she genuinely thought Lyra was a good kid...or maybe Pullman just needed to create a series where the main character's mother loved her and was willing to stretch the reader's suspension of disbelief as much as he needed to in order to get there. Mrs. Coulter claimed to love Lyra, but she never had a real, honest conversation with her, never respected her rights, never apologized to her (and apologies are oh so very important in this series, because it's The Right Thing To Do), never had any real reason to change her mind about Lyra other than the fact that Lyra turned out to be \"special.\" Throughout the whole book, the reader is wondering whether Mrs. Coulter is a double agent, or a triple agent, or just a plain wacked-out, twisted evil woman who works for herself and no one else. And in the end, even though she nobly sacrifices herself to bring about something or other good, I never really felt convinced of her goodness because there was no solid rationale for it. It just felt like Pullman pulling the puppet-strings and saying, \"You're a good mother now!\" Asriel, on the other hand, is never redeemed, as far as I'm concerned, not even through author-intervention. He's still as ruthless, pitiless, cold, and calculating as he was from the very beginning \u2013 so how are we supposed to root for Asriel's side when both he and Mrs. Coulter are no better than the enemy they're fighting?Pullman was also bad at giving satisfying justifications for his other characters' motives. In this book, Lyra suddenly comes up with the idea that she wants to visit the Land of the Dead. Why didn't she think of this in the second book? Why haven't we heard more about her guilt if it really has been eating her up all this time? Why is an apology worth more than four people's lives? Why is there a Land of the Dead at all, since we've heard nothing about it until now and it doesn't really fit with the whole, you know, atheism thing? The more perilous and ridiculous the journey to the Land of the Dead seems, and the more people warn Lyra about the dangers of going there, the more stubborn she becomes. Will has an equally pathetic reason for wanting to visit his father. To do what? How can you possibly establish a connection with the ghost of a person you didn't know well even when they were alive? The entire enterprise of going to the Land of the Dead seemed to be Pullman's way of engineering an \"end to death,\" because it fits with the whole disobeying-God theme in Paradise Lost. When I realized that Pullman was going to stick with the allegory even if it didn't make sense within the world he had created, I couldn't help but lose a lot of respect for the book.Why was it forbidden for Will to think of his mother, which would distract him from his mission, but it was ok for Lyra to obssess about Roger and drag herself and others into peril just to assuage her own guilt? There never was a good reason given for why Will had to forget all about his mother in order to keep the knife intact, but Lyra's obsession with Roger was allowed to be a major driving force in the narrative. Is Roger more important than Will's mother? Certainly not from my perspective. Roger is even more flat than Will and Lyra as far as characters go. He wasn't even interesting when he was alive \u2013 why should I care about him now that he's dead? Because Roger was dead (which itself served no other purpose than to make Asriel look like a jerk), and because Pullman needed to force the characters to go to the Land of the Dead, he played up Lyra's part in Roger's death and tried to convince the reader that Roger was actually quite important, and ever so helpful and good and true. I got extremely tired of the whole \"Huzzah, let's rescue him!\" mentality of the characters. It's the same old epic, unrealistically high stakes, the same old Characters of Destiny who must fulfill a prophecy of some kind in order to save the world.Which brings me to my annoyance with the end of the book. Pullman pulled out all the stops on this one. Will and Lyra are experiencing \"true love,\" no matter that they're only twelve years old and have known each other for a few months! Did I mention that they're twelve years old? I balked at the dramatic and maudlin ending because I could not get over the fact that these were pre-teens in the most exaggerated throes of hormone-driven passion and Pullman wanted us to take this seriously, wanted us to believe this was \"true love.\" Maybe my cynicism about the ending is just a symptom of the fact that I'm older than the target audience for this book. Still, there is clearly a subtext to the series that Pullman put in there for the benefit of adults. Why would he insult his adult readers by holding up this extremely young, inexperienced, twelve-year-old couple as the paragon of romantic love?From a logistical point of view, it doesn't even seem plausible that Will and Lyra had to be separated at all. Pullman wanted a tragic, \"coming-of-age\" ending, so he invented plot hooks to get there. The fact is, if there's enough wonder and curiosity and open-mindedness and kindness in the world to keep one window open, then surely there's enough to keep two open. I'm not convinced that things would be just fine with a giant window open for the rest of time to let hordes of the dead escape, but the universe would erupt into nothingness if a small, person-sized hole was left open for the next 60 years or so, just until Will and Lyra died and no longer needed it. Pullman dangled out the possibility of a happy ending, but then, for a completely arbitrary and author-generated reason, he shut down that possibility so that Will and Lyra could \"grow up\" or \"lose their innocence\" or some other platitude. I understand that being separated from each other was Pullman's way of representing their exile from Paradise, but again, this is another case where he's letting the allegory dictate how the story will turn out rather than directing and crafting his own story according to what makes the most sense. Oh, and for the record: nobody kills God in this book. Rather than railing against this book for the supposed death of God, why don't people instead rail against this book for being bad?

The plot was very contrived and the characters have lost the remaining appeal that they had in the first 2 books. The \"redemption\" of Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel is utterly unconvincing. Pullman makes an open mockery of God, whom he depicts as a weak, timid, helpless old being manipulated by a twisted, tryanicial angel. No, Lyra and Wil don't kill God in the end, but Pullman does. The story culminates in the predictable recreation of Adam and Eve's experience in the garden, with the conclusion that Satan had it right all along.  The problem with Pullman's \"Republic of Heaven\" ideal is that he puts too much faith in humanity. History has proven time and again that men are incapable of building and sustaining a truly benevolent society. We need God in order to build heaven. (The true God, not a warped idea of Him as seen in many religions today). The only thing worse than religious oppression is Godless oppression.  Pullman is right that men have corrupted the truth, and this is manifest in many false teachings in religions today, but he is wrong in concluding that this is God's fault, or that the very idea of God is false, and that God himself is a corrupt invention of man. There is a God, He is good, and there is a true way of worshipping him that affirms humanity. Pullman is also right that human passions have wrongfully been suppressed by many religions. But he is wrong in suggesting that there should be no higher authority to set bounds on human passions. Our passions are God-given, and God desires that we enjoy them. He teaches us, not to deny ourselves of these passions, but to deny ourselves of selfish and harmful (to ourselves or to others) expressions of these passions. There is an appropriate bounds. True religion strikes the right balance between the full expression of human passion and approprate self restraint. Finally, Pullman is also right about one thing in the Garden of Eden: it was a good thing, ultimately, that Adam and Eve partook of that fruit. It is in fact what God intended to happen. There was nothing inherently evil in the fruit itself. The sin was in doing so at Satan's urging.

I\u2019m glad I was told about the connection to Milton, but in this last volume there are hints enough for the reader in form of poems and quotes at the beginning of each chapter; of William Blake, Emily Dickinson and John Milton.The Amber Spyglass is about Will further travelling through the worlds, now in the possession of the Subtle Knife (how much I love that boy with his quiet courage and sense of duty and faithfulness). Lyra has been taken and is kept sedated by Mrs. Coulter and has to be rescued \u2013 or be taken by enemy forces who have also found out where she is being kept. Accompanying Will are a number of new companions ((view spoiler)[first two gay angels which I thought a brilliant characterization and for whom I almost cried because their fate was heartbreaking, then two miniature creatures riding fireflies and spying for Lord Asriel (hide spoiler)]). We learn that many places known through myths and fairy tales (such as the Kingdom of Heaven, the world of the dead etc) are simply other worlds in the multiverse. However, about 300 years ago something went wrong with dust and caused problems throughout them all. Mary Mallone, the physicist Lyra encountered in the previous book, is also travelling through the worlds, guided by the I Ching, which is basically another version of what the alethiometer is, settling eventually in a very interesting one populated by elephantine creatures that use seed pod wheels for transportation. Simultaneously we have Lyra\u2019s parents and their respective secret plans helped by all kinds of peoples. Last but not least, we also meet some old friends such as Iorek and his panserbj\u00d8rns (though I was a bit disappointed as he didn\u2019t seem as faithful a friend as Lee Scoresby or the witches) and all of them, alive and dead (for bad things have been done to the dead as well), play a role here because the end battle is against the Authority (God) itself, represented by Metatron as well as the entire army of Heaven. What I love is that you can never truly be sure which person is good and which one is evil. For example, we know that Lyra and Will are innocent, despite them having had to kill and lie.The only true enemy is the Authority as he is an oppressive \u201ehigher\u201c being ((view spoiler)[interesting twist that it only claimed to be the creator of it all without actually being it (hide spoiler)]) who wants to limit the knowledge and awareness of all evolved beings throughout the multiverse in order to exert greater control (interestingly enough, Metatron is even worse although he was only turned into an angel by the Authority). Thus, even though I\u2019m not a fan of Lord Asriel's, I understand why he does what he does and agree that the war with the Authority is necessary. Enlightenment instead of blind obedience. Nevertheless, no matter what was said and done by him and Mrs. Coulter in this book, they are simply irredeemable to me.But Pullman never makes it easy and so all of the characters have good and bad sides and most of the time the author even plays with our expectations and our definitions and turns them upside down to emphasize that neither any world nor any creature therein is black-or-white.The fact that while the battle has of course a gigantic scale, it\u2019s not really about it (not only), was a wonderful notion as well. Because the battle is not won on a classic battlefield alone, but in the hearts and minds of people like Lyra and that exposition was beautifully done.Moreover, I very much enjoyed the exploration of the multiverse by all kinds of different people as well as the different worlds themselves. All questions are answered, all events and encounters (such as the spectres) explained. Most importantly, Pullman said Lyra's sexual awakening \"is exactly what happens in the Garden of Eden \u2026 Why the Christian Church has spent 2,000 years condemning this glorious moment, well, that's a mystery. I want to confront that, I suppose, by telling a story that this so-called original sin is anything but. It's the thing that makes us fully human.\"Isn\u2019t that a lovely idea and an immensely important one as well?Which is why it is an abominable crime that the American version of this book was changed (the North American edition censors passages describing Lyra's incipient sexuality)!Despite the grande scale of the battle, we\u2019re still getting the delicate undertone of growing up and finding out who you are, being true to yourself, even if it is hard and risky and you\u2019re absolutely not sure at all that it\u2019ll be alright in the end, which (to me at least) was one of the most important messages throughout anyway.Personally, I\u2019m an atheist but I do think Pullman pulled off something remarkable here. He doesn\u2019t make it a fight between believers and non-believers; all he\u2019s saying is that even if you do believe, no being has the right to suppress others and knowledge (learning, understanding, making technological advancements to create a better life) is not a sin.Not many authors are capable of weaving such a complex story with so many layers of meaning and symbolism that is still thrilling and full of adventure as well as relatable fantasy elements and great and vivid characters.", "num_likes": 38, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/9966958", "review_id": "9966958", "date": "Dec 05, 2007", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Seth T.", "user_url": "/user/show/160319-seth-t", "text": "(This fits within the scope of my review of the full series)Book three was just a mess.

I mean, let's look at this for a moment: we're surrounded by liars who are heroes, murderers who are the best of folks, drunkards who are the most noble, and a God who is feeble, the push of the devil is a rather positive thing, and we're meant to root for the big battle against Enoch, one of two of the only men in the Bible to ever have been raptured up to heaven. (Of course, he was promoted well beyond his ability and became the Metatron, the big bad false God-in-Standing, so we're not meant to feel like we're ACTUALLY satanists here as we read this book.)What? Wait, WHAT?Oh, that's okay, folks. It's fine because this was written by an agnostic atheist. He only believes in enjoying life on the material plane, in making heaven right here on Earth, not falling for the one-off and rather harmful joke we've always been told. After all, Heaven Doesn't Exist. Hello! Be good here and now while you're still alive, dummy!But let's review this: The series is one of the most well-beloved series by almost everyone for all time. Why?Because it's liberating? Because it puts a sharpened stick in the flaming pile of poo of an idea that says that sex in the idea of Original Sin is BAD? Or is it because most of us are sick to death about religion? Or because he manages to subvert everything and still manages to give everyone a bit of good in the tale and refuses to make the whole story about Atheists versus Deists?I simply do not know.I do know that the rolling elephants were f***ing stupid.I didn't mind the whole trip down under, however. :)Original Review:I thought it was hilarious to have Enoch, my favorite, rare renegade man amongst angels play the villain. It was especially precious to have a reversal of roles for our favorite angels in heaven and a not so thin veiled christ figure in the shape of a lying little girl flying down to sheol to free all the purgatoried souls. I giggled some more when those little wheeled beasties crushed the nuts of an otherwise smooth storyline. Honestly, it wasn't my favorite book of all time; neither was the whole series; but I did really enjoy the whole Madeline L'Engle fantasy touch. As opposed to the painful C. S. Lewis touch, Pullman has an even lighter touch, with a generous dose of darkness to help us swallow a completely virtuous pre-teen serial murderer who loves his mom and an imagination-less serial liar who takes the role of christ. This isn't to say I didn't like the novels, mind you very much. It makes me wonder what would happen if Chuck Palahniuk rewrote these novels. Hmmm.

While I don't believe the book is flawless, I felt a lot of reviewers took out their frustrations on Pullman's politics or his decision to twist the happy ending rather than on the storytelling itself. I thought, whatever problems you have with the book, the storytelling, magic, and emotional power of the book were absolutely riveting. I rarely rush through books so quickly, but I would find myself staying up to read \"just one more\" chapter and move through three or four because I just couldn't put it down. Because I don't really know where to start, I'll just address some of the main problems other people have mentioned. 1) The \"there are too many main characters/worlds/ideas\" thing. I respectfully disagree; I felt that he expanded on characters we had known previously (particularly Mary Malone, who I really came to love), while simultaneously introducing new, fully-fleshed out characters. I didn't need an entire book devoted to Balthamos or Baruch to understand them, or more exposition on Atal's life before Mary's visit to the mulefa's world. I loved watching the development of Tialys and the Lady Salmakia. Ultimately, I felt he wove these new lives in without ever losing the sense of Lyra and Will--who I think were even more smartly written and complex here than in either of the other two books. I think Pullman was surprisingly deft at weaving everything together while keeping a strong primary focus on Lyra and Will's coming-of-age (and \"Fall\").2) Several people think his character choices were mere plot devices or cop-outs. For instance, Asriel and Mrs. Coulter, and their redemption through their love for Lyra and for one another. While I loved Mrs. Coulter as a deliciously cruel villainess, I think his decisions with her character in this were both surprising and wonderfully done. Mrs. Coulter explains it herself--she had saved Lyra twice before in the other books; that she did so again here really wasn't out-of-the-blue in this book, as so many people have said. Her love for Lyra may have seemed out-of-character to some, but for me, it made perfect sense. The thing I loved about Mrs. Coulter most was that I never really knew what she would do next. You come to assume she's going to make ridiculously cruel moves, but even then, what were her motives? Whose side was she on? Would she switch? Her changes and redemption in this, for me, just proved that Mrs. Coulter was the most superbly unpredictable character of the trilogy. I'll concede that Asriel was a bit more surprising to me in a less skillful way, but we did see a bit of a preface to the final scene between him, Coulter, and Metatron (Asriel/Marisa's union) at the end of the first book, when he offered his hand to her to work together. So I felt it still made sense and was really touching, at least for me. Someone mentioned the harpies--I found the whole bit in the Land of the Dead to be incredibly moving and invigorated. That the harpies came around resonated with me--yes, it does seem a bit silly that no one would have thought to tell the harpies stories beforehand, but I think themes of truth and storytelling (and stories as a way towards redemption or creative expression) were finally fulfilled here, after much leading up to them through Lyra.3) The religious aspect. While I certainly agree with one review that called Pullman out on his inherently pantheistic world, I don't think that should necessarily be considered a flaw, simply because he identifies himself and the trilogy as anti-theistic. There is, of course, some Higher Power in Pullman's world(s)--but that power isn't God, it isn't his high angels, and it isn't the church. That in itself is a bold move for a \"children's\" author (or most any author) to make. While Dust certainly has some kind of mystical subtext to it, I think his decision to place religion in the hands of the natural universe is beautifully written and thought-out. Sure, they kill God (which has been called blasphemy by some reviewers--why read/review it, if you're going to give it an unwarranted one star on the sole basis of your divergence from his (and the book's) politics?)--but I think Pullman makes quite clear that the greater meaning of the war against God, etc. is that it is rather against the Kingdom of Heaven, which is corrupt and tyrannical, losing the meaning of the supposed \"goodness\" of religion altogether. I'm an atheist, but just as his rejection of orthodox religion didn't bother me, neither did his inability to fully narrate an atheist storyline/world/whathaveyou. So to bash the book on the basis of disagreeing with the underlying value system seems to me an injustice; it's not a theological polemical or academic essay--it's a book, and a terrific one, in my mind.Of course, as I said, it's not perfect. The end was a bit disappointing, but for me, again, it made sense. I think I would prefer the realization that adults have to face hardships--like separation, lost-love, recognition of the self in the context of many others--than to have everything tied up in a pretty, romantic package. That Will and Lyra must be separated seems to me the most adult moment of the trilogy; as they move from childish selfishness into the hard realities of adult responsibility and decision-making, they make the hardest decision of their lives, and effectively seal the deal of their Fall from childhood to adulthood. So while it may not be the saccharinely satisfying union of the two in eternal love, it leaves the reader with a sense of loss and nostalgia, which everyone must face as they enter the real world. I would have preferred more of Serrafina Pekkala and Iorek (among a few other favorite characters), and I felt that the Fall itself wasn't as epic as it was built up to be, but I felt really satisfied with the book and the trilogy on the whole. I think it's more disheartening to see so many reviews bashing it for reasons I don't really understand, and many that seem, quite frankly, inessential to the book/trilogy itself. I still highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind and a love of great storytelling.", "num_likes": 32, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1927910436", "review_id": "1927910436", "date": "Feb 28, 2017", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Aiden Heavilin", "user_url": "/user/show/65067206-aiden-heavilin", "text": "Imagine if Frodo stopped his quest and decided to go back to Hobbiton in order to return a library book.

Imagine my surprise when, after finally reading this series which so many people had ranted and raved about, i discover it to be little more than that: a contrarian mis-interpretation of Milton written by a perpetually bitter adolescent. This is the sort of thing I thought was cool when I was 10 or 11, and which most people think is cool when they are in High School. It is also the sort of thing most of us grow up and discard, having matured and moved on. Sadly Pullman and his fans seem to be stuck with a very one-dimensional reading of Milton, the Bible, religion...and, well, most things in life. His awareness of religion seems to be limited primarily to neo-paganism, Catholicism/Anglicanism, and maaaaaaaaybe Islam; the characters are paper-thin; the plot has been done better elsewhere; and the smug sense of self-righteousness that bleeds through every phrase is suffocating. It's like Pullman just listed a bunch of traditional beliefs/doctrines/assumptions, recast them as their opposites, and genuinely believed himself to be doing something original and revelatory. It's almost sad.Contrarian elements:Is God traditionally good? Then let's make him BAD!Is religion traditionally good? Then let's make it BAD!Is God traditionally omnipotent?

Throw in some racism, anti-Islamism and anti-Catholicism and you've got the entire book.ADDENDUM: [Composed in part as a response to a 5-star review of The Golden Compass I read elsewhere] I think people can see it as atheist propaganda because its author has admitted it is such. Also, its God-analogue is a senile, toothless being desperate for death, and both he and his fellow-angels are actually just extra-dimensional aliens who've been lying to everyone and merely pretending to be the creators of the universe -- this is stated in the narrative. They have been lying and deceiving everyone to maintain their authoritarian regime.Also, part of the point of Milton's Lucifer is that he's a charismatic and convincing, but also a self-centered liar. He preaches rebellion, then rallies the troops with a promise of freedom...but still places himself above them.

I mean that the way the series was completed felt all over the place, that the tone changed dramatically in The Subtle Knife and even more so in this one; and if Northern Lights is a great fantasy novel, enjoyable on so many levels, the other two feel, at moments, more like a mere series of political, religious and moral ideas the author meant to engrave in young people's minds.  This series has an incredibly detailed and amazing world-building; the \"magic system\" is stunning, the creatures absolutely amazing (I personally think that the idea of daemons is one of the greatest inventions in the history of fantasy), the plot intricate and the characters believable and lovable. I only wish that the author would have kept his political and religious ideas a little bit more private. I'm not saying that one's moral and ideological system should stay out of their art - the will to spread one's way of seeing the world is one of the reasons art exists in the first place - but while re-reading this trilogy I couldn't help but thinking that this is, after all, for a young adult public and some ideas on God, religion and politics felt a little too extreme for a younger public. Even for an adult, they felt definitely too heavy; and in some passages the last two books where just too explanatory and it really made the whole experience much heavier and less magical than it could have been.

The result is book that, while excellent in places, is somewhat less enjoyable than the first two volumes of His Dark Materials.In The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife the narrative focused on Lyra and Will, the two main characters. In this book the action jumps between their story and three or four others, which are at times peripheral and uninteresting. The most egregious case is the storyline that follows Father Gomez, the priest sent to kill Lyra. This story goes nowhere: he never encounters Lyra and is eliminated by a character we thought had left the book several hundred pages previously. His story serves no purpose other than to inject some cheap tension and offer a platform for another dig at the Magisterium/Church through the doctrine of preemptive absolution (a cool idea, it must be said). This seems to be the motivation for many of the digressions. It's almost as if Pullman had a list of neat ideas, realized this was his last chance to get them in the series, and resolved to insert them at any cost.There is also a great deal of convenience in the narrative. The alethiometers have become both deus and machina: everyone has one and can suddenly read them almost perfectly. This becomes a crutch for Pullman to move the story along without much motivation. Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter, at best morally ambiguous in the previous books, have become good for unclear reasons.For all these narrative problems on the fringes, the central story involving Lyra and Will is strong. The more serious problem is the preachiness. Narratively the problem is that it's very heavy handed, but I don't want to focus on that. Nor do I object to the content of Pullman's message. My problem is that Pullman seems to be mistaken about what he is preaching.Pullman has claimed in interviews that he wanted to be the anti-C. S. Lewis and that unlike Milton, who was of the Devil's party and didn't know it, he is of the Devil's party and knows it. These claims certainly helped raise the profile of the books and the film (about which less said, the better), but they are overstated. I believe, on the contrary, that Pullman is of God's party and doesn't know it. Pullman's cosmology is very similar to Christianity's, and his trilogy very similar to more overtly Christian fantasies like The Chronicles of Narnia.This may seem to be a perverse claim to make. Pullman, after all, has a chacter whom we are supposed to believe say Christianity \"is a very powerful and convincing mistake.\" But it is at least a plausable reading. In the first place, Pullman's world is not atheist. It is pantheist: the universe is god. This god communicates through the alethiometer and other truth-telling devices, which not only tell the factual truth, but also give moral advice. The alethiometer frequently tells Lyra that things are right and wrong, not just true or false.Second, the relationship between god and the demonic element (The Authority) is exactly the same as it is in Christian accounts of Satan. In both cases a creature falsely claims to be the creator in order to gratify his own pride and exert his own power. This rebellion is the origin of evil in both stories. In both cases things can be set right by recognizing and rejecting the false claims of the demonic authority, a miraculous and unexpected intervention by the true god, and learning to love one another. Admittedly Christians are not pantheists, but most do not believe God is a lion either. Pullman has changed the form, but the content is remarkably similar.Finally, both Pullman and Lewis show their characters learning moral lessons that the reader is also supposed to imbibe. In both cases the characters learn to be brave, honest, and loyal; to sacrifice their own immediate desires to the needs of others; and to pursue truth and knowledge, including to question authority. Pullman is not exactly tearing up the foundations of Christian morality here.Rather than seeing Pullman as an atheist or anti-Christian author, it is more accurate to see his as part of a long tradition of English anti-clerical (and perhaps anti-papist, although that's a different review) writers. Many Christians have understood the visible Church to be corrupt and the clergy to be ambitious for power, without ceasing to be Christian. Some might even argue this is an essential truth of Christianity.", "num_likes": 25, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/9943660", "review_id": "9943660", "date": "Dec 04, 2007", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Lori Anderson", "user_url": "/user/show/382208-lori-anderson", "text": "I am so glad I'm done reading this series.

In this one we find out just what Lord Asriel is doing, much more about the intriguing Mrs Coulter, more about Dust and why Will and Lyra are so important. They go on an incredible journey and have many dangerous encounters. I really like the introduction of some of the new creatures such as the wonderful Mulefa - sort of elephants on wheels, who Mary meets and helps and in return they assist in the making of the amber spyglass though which she can view Dust. I also love the teeny tiny chevalier Gallivespians (think Lilliputians) with a sting in their spurs who ride on the backs of dragonflies. Wonderful. There is no question the quality of the writing is exceptional and it\u2019s so imaginative but I think the Northern Lights, Book One of the trilogy is by far the best.

It was wonderful, balancing thought-provoking philosophy with nearly breakneck-speed action in this final installment. Pullman crafted a world, or should I say worlds, that I found captivating, and characters whom I grew to care about deeply. Many of these characters, especially Lyra and Will, have taken a little piece of my heart, and I believe they\u2019ll reside there from now on. What a marvelous adventure.\u201cI have stolen ideas from every book I have ever read.\u201dWhile reading this book, I did something fairly unusual for me: I kept having to write about my thoughts. Usually, I might take notes on my phone and compile them all after finishing the book, or simply take no notes at all and write a review with nothing but my final thoughts circling around in my head. I could do neither here. I had to actually write out my thoughts as they came to me, so I didn\u2019t forget to address something that I felt was important or forget why that element felt important in the first place. Because I responded to this book so differently from most, my review is going to be a bit different, as well. The next four or five paragraphs are thoughts I had to write out while I was reading. I decided to leave them mostly in their raw form instead of polishing them up and trying to wrangle them into some kind of flow that made sense. Most of these observations and opinions are very religious in nature, as this trilogy hinges so strongly on both belief and Christian mythos, so remember that these are incredibly subjective leanings. Without further ado, here are those thoughts. If you tire of my rambling, feel free to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final views.\u201cI stopped believing there was a power of good and a power of evil that were outside us. And I came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do, not for what they are.\u201dThe problem with the Church of Lyra\u2019s world isn\u2019t their belief or their faith, which I actually saw very little evidence in the series. The problem is that they wish to erase the gift of free will. God could have prevented the original Fall of man in the form of Eve\u2019s choice and Adam\u2019s decision to follow her example. But He didn\u2019t, because one of the greatest gifts He gave us was the ability to make our own decisions through free will. Mankind has no right to revoke that right from future generations, because it\u2019s not a right we bestowed on ourselves to begin with. Instead of taking away our ability to make our own decisions, God gave us another option: accepting the gift of salvation provided by His Son\u2019s death and resurrection.\u201cAll the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity.\u201dThe theory of gaining absolution before the committing of a sin is one of the most disturbing concepts I\u2019ve encountered. It flies in the face of God\u2019s gift and His claim to judge us by our motivations even more than by our deeds. I know that this is a tenet that was once held by very radical sects of the Church, but it\u2019s absolutely repugnant and theologically unsound. Which actually made it a perfect fit for the Church as portrayed by Pullman.\u201cI\u2019m just trying to wake up - I\u2019m so afraid of sleeping all my life and then dying - I want to wake up first. I wouldn\u2019t care if it was just for an hour, as long as I was properly alive and awake\u2026\u201d A number of the epigraphs in the book come from John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, which would have seemed like an almost too obvious decision from Pullman if this weren\u2019t so obviously inspired in large part by Milton\u2019s work. And as Milton conveyed Lucifer more as an antihero than a villain, it was easy to guess which side Pullman would favor in his narrative. However, Pullman\u2019s take was original enough to maintain a level of unpredictability often absent in stories that are so closely linked to a retelling.\u201cPeople are too complicated to have simple labels.\u201dThe descriptions of the Mulefa and their world reminded me of Perelandra, a world visited by Ransom in Lewis\u2019s Space Trilogy. The mood, the innocence, the vast difference between the sentient creatures and humankind, and the relationship one of the adult human characters develops with these unique creatures all hearkened back to Lewis\u2019s Ransom, and his experiences. This was a welcome addition, and was a much needed change of pace in the midst of so much action and trauma throughout the rest of the book.\u201cWhat work do I have to do then?\" said Will, but went on at once, \"No, on second thought, don't tell me. I shall decide what I do. If you say my work is fighting, or healing, or exploring, or whatever you might say, I'll always be thinking about it. And if I do end up doing that, I'll be resentful because it'll feel as if I didn't have a choice, and if I don't do it, I'll feel guilty because I should. Whatever I do, I will choose it, no one else.\u201dThe spoiler that was thrown in my face when I was a child, (view spoiler)[namely that the two main characters kill God (hide spoiler)], was vastly overstated by the person who delivered it. Yes, this event does occur, but I was expecting premeditated brutality, not the quiet, heartbreaking outcome of an act of kindness. The whole worldview of this trilogy, while different from my own, was not nearly as radical as I was led to believe. This is a story of growing up, of leaving childhood when all you want to do is cling to it, of choosing one dream from many and mourning as the other possibilities move from could-be to might-have-been. It\u2019s about doing good when it would be so much easier to be selfish, and redeeming yourself when the decisions of your past had a hand in harming others. It\u2019s about love and free will and that fact that being able to choose your own path is both blessing and curse. I believe all these things. Where I differ from Pullman is in my belief that God is near, that He respects your choices but cares deeply about you, while Pullman conveys a God who is distant, uncaring, and fallible. I very strongly disagree with this quote and others like it for pretty obvious reasons: \u201cThe Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake.\u201d Pullman and I couldn\u2019t be more opposed on that statement. Did that difference make me love this book, and the trilogy in its entirety, any less? Absolutely not.\u201cWhen you choose one way out of many, all the ways you don't take are snuffed out like candles, as if they'd never existed.\u201d I was honestly blown about by His Dark Materials. It is one of the richest, most lovingly crafted trilogies I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reading. It is epic and heartbreaking and sweet and fierce, and I absolutely loved it. Both Lyra and Will, and many of their supporting cast, will always have a place in my heart. Especially Lyra. She is kind and brave and incredibly loving, and I think every little girl could use a role model like her. Each book somehow improved the volume that preceded it, and it\u2019s a series that I believe will lend itself very well to rereadings. His Dark Materials is a modern classic of the fantasy genre for a reason, and it\u2019s well worth your time.You can find this review and more at Novel Notions.

This philosophy seems to be a kind of Nietzschean materialist version of gnosticism (phew!). His is a universe which allows only of one interpretation, a place where the event is nothing but the intervention of chaos and the void and must be negated so the status quo can be restored in the full glory of its disciplinary order. It is a universe where the human curiosity for knowledge leads to ruin and annihilation (although the author overtly claims the opposite) and where the fluidity of identity must be replaced by the supremacy of the rational and by fixed identity.Just to break down those abstractions a bit. The \u2018event\u2019 is the opening up of windows to other worlds by scientists \u2013 Lord Asriel and the scientists in the Cittagazze. This leads to the beginning of the breakdown of the universe and the potential annihilation of consciousness. It is scientific curiosity about what is out there and other worlds that leads to this situation.Views on identity centre around daemons (souls). Children have daemons which can change shape until they reach puberty. After that, they become fixed which Pullman indicates several times is a good thing and a sign of maturity and wisdom. This identity also appears to maintain the social order. Once a servant always a servant. As Lyra explains in The Amber Spyglass the daemons of servants are usually dogs, indicating that these are people who need to be led and ordered around. One is not a servant due to unjust social circumstances or questionable social hierarchies but because that is what one\u2019s nature is and one must remain as ordained. Entire armies of Tartars have wolf daemons. If one is not happy with one\u2019s daemon \u2013 too bad \u2013 you are stuck with it. So much for social justice or working on the self as a project.Lyra, when she hits puberty, loses her intuitive ability to read the alethiometer and must then be formed by the disciplinary institution of the (boarding) school in order to develop rational techniques to read it. It is the Modernist idea that fantasy and intuition are the province of childhood and are properly replaced by adult \u2018rationality\u2019. C. Wright Mills provides a classic example of this kind of thinking in his 1959 work The Sociological Imagination.Dust appears to be conscious matter which works in sync with humans \u2013 it is both attracted to humans and generated by humans. It relies on humans to aggregate into a conscious form. Angels are beings who can\u2019t quite pull it off in terms of really existing because they have no real material body. They are half existences (even if they are powerful) and envy the body of humans.A propos this angelic nature, Will is content to ask entities such as angels whether they are stronger or weaker than humans. When the first angel he meets, Balthamos, replies he is weaker than humans, Will bluntly tells him that he has to do what he orders him to do in that case. This theme of exploiting his position as the strongest emerges again and again. If Will thinks he can exercise power over somebody or something he doesn\u2019t hesitate to do so. The Nietzschean hero indeed.\u2018God\u2019 or \u2018the Authority\u2019 is an evil being who only wants to dominate and control Man and is frightened of the power of the latter. What we have here is an old-fashioned modernist anthropomorphic view of the universe. Humans (and the equivalents thereof) are the centre and the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of all conscious being.On another topic, the idea of a romantic interlude between two twelve year old children resulting in the salvation of the universe both present and future is both tacky and unconvincing. Why should \u2018Dust\u2019 (aka conscious matter particles) find such an event to be the stabilising point?There is no room for multiple interpretations of elements within Pullman\u2019s cosmology, which makes it a very closed and small universe. At the same time it is hard to pin down what is actually going on satisfactorily and it all seems very confused and self-contradictory at the edges. It would appear that both scientific and spiritual forms of experimental knowledge are dangerous to the well-being of the entire universe and that the best we can do is conform to a rigid disciplinary status quo which will preserve our nature and protect us from the danger of annihilation. There is nothing but a gaping void beyond or outside of this status quo. Even when you are dead you are recycled to guarantee the ongoing existence of this ghastly stasis.In conclusion, one is left with nowhere to go at the end of Pullman\u2019s trilogy but that would appear to be the author\u2019s aim in any case.", "num_likes": 21, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["science-fiction-fantasy"]}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/103744149", "review_id": "103744149", "date": "May 21, 2010", "rating": 1, "user_name": "notgettingenough ", "user_url": "/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough", "text": "Irritated and inelegant.

I don't think that most kids would be able to navigate the intricacies of Pullman's ideas and separate the story from the rhetoric. I see this as a major problem since they are written for and marketed to children.That being said, there are a lot things about the books that I found really interesting. For example, the people of this world have a creature that is part of them, their daemon. The daemons are a physical manifestation of the person's soul, which is an incredibly interesting idea. The children have daemons that can change forms symbolizing how their personalities are not fixed or decided. When a child matures his daemon takes on a form that best portrays that person's character and personality. In a way the daemons act as a conscious; they also reveals character traits that a person might want to keep hidden.Pullman's books definitely have an anti-organized religion slant. But the issues that Pullman tackles in the first couple books are things that I don't believe in anyway - like original sin and the church wielding political power. Here's what Pullman himself said about that, \"When religion acquires that power, it goes bad very rapidly. That's the criticism I think the story of His Dark Materials is making, because in Lyra's world, power is wielded by religious authority, and that's why it's gone wrong.\" One of the major conflicts in the story is a Galileo-esque tale of a man who makes a scientific discovery that goes against the doctrine of the Magestrium (the church and the seat of political power.) And since he is like Galileo, you can imagine how well the Magestrium takes that discovery.One thing that really bothered me about the first couple books actually has nothing to do with Pullman but just the general state of the world right now. That is the fact that it always seems like the church goers in books have to be crazy - either crazy controlling or crazy religious or just plain crazy. I'm shaking my head now in frustration.Where things got dicey for me with Pullman's books was in the last book of the trilogy. Now instead of fighting against the corrupt church, Lyra's father wages a war against heaven and God is portrayed as an old man, which I found pretty offensive. However, that being said, I never got the impression that Lyra's dad was a \"good guy\" or that he was doing the right thing by trying to overthrow God.As far as the physically inappropriate behavior is concerned, I never really could decide what happened in that scene. It's clear that the kids love each other (they actually aren't that young, 14 and 15, I think) but that is all that is clear. Involved in this situation, is a character who is told that she is \"to play the serpent,\" as in the Garden of Eden. And, I suppose, that if you believed that Adam and Eve were kicked out of the Garden of Eden because of some sexual sin (which I know people do), you might read this section of the book in that way. But I'm not sure if that is what Pullman was going for.Ok. So final run down. Is all the criticism hype? No. But most of it is too heavy handed. Am I sorry I read the books? No. And I would even consider reading them again. I would like to get my mind around some of Pullman's critiques and see if I feel as uncomfortable with some of the stuff as I did the first time (it's been 4 years probably). I walked into these books blindly. I didn't have any idea what I was getting myself into when I started reading them, and so I think I was doubly shocked by some of the themes of the books. But what a fruitful conversation Pullman has started. I would love to talk to someone who has carefully and thoughtfully read the books.

The whole thing seemed rushed, as if he threw together every disparate idea he could think of at the last minute and didn't really plan ahead. I wanted this to be a great series, but it didn't really reach its potential.I really liked the descriptions of angels at the beginning of the second book, as these strangely alien creatures with wisdom far beyond our own and their attention fixed on other-worldly things. But as the story progressed, it seemed like they became petty and simple and not really any different from flying, glowing humans.I liked the way he described Mary's conversations with the mulefa in italics, to represent her poor understanding of the language without bogging down the reader with the poor translation itself. I liked the machine-conversations with Dust. I liked Iorek's discussion about how the knife should never have been created, and the observation that someone was going to create it eventually, so it's for the best that good-hearted people hold it.But some parts seemed quite implausible or unnecessary:Harpies given the task of tormenting people for eternity, and they just turn around and become nice after being told a story? None of the trillions of dead people from the last thousands of years ever thought to try that?Shining with brilliance, the angel, second-in-command to God, with the wisdom and insight of thousands of years of existence, is betrayed to his death... by a few minutes of flirting?And how can Will just teach the angels to close the windows? Isn't that his job alone?How can you grab an angel by his wings and drag him to his death if angels can change form?But I liked the whole notion of the war against God, so I gave him some leeway in his attempts to describe it. I like the idea of Will putting God out of his misery, without ever realizing what he's done.Two chapters from the end, I put the book down and was awash with ideas about religion, authority, war, peace, the \"god-shaped hole\" that we supposedly try to fill with material pleasures, Mary's ex-Christianity, my own ex-Christianity, and the relationship of all these things to our experience of love and happiness and fulfillment. I was really liking the series, pacing my apartment in excited thought and wanting to recommend it to everyone, especially those with religious backgrounds.But then all that hopefulness and inspiration is ruined by the needlessly traumatic ending. You have such empathy for Lyra and Will's young perfect love, everything's coming together for good and happiness, without a need for a god, and then Pullman breaks your heart and splits them apart forever. It felt to me like the entire ending was just a series of hastily-invented plot devices existing solely to force the main characters into unhappiness.\"Oh, by the way, you can't live in the same world as each other for more than a few years or you'll die. Annnd all the windows have to be closed, or the world will end. I guess you can have one open, but you can't use it for yourselves. No, not two; just one. And you can't make temporary holes because every one you make kills people. And uh, you can teach the angels to close them even without the knife, so no, you can't go around with Lyra visiting all the different worlds together and closing all of them. Not yours.\"Not only that, but he takes away their special abilities and thrusts them into dull normal lives again. Boarding school? Running from the law? Why? I don't know what he was trying to teach by doing all of this. Something about growing up and... what? The whole \"Republic of Heaven\" ending is lost on me now; all I can think of is the tragedy of their lost love.This is supposed to be a book about losing faith in religion and finding other meaning in life, but all I got out of it was depressed.

The only disappointment was that it seemed anti-climactic. I was expecting a little more to the ending, going out with a bang, not the relatively quiet exit that it actually had. It didn't kill the novel for me, but it did disappoint me a bit. I'm wondering if Pullman chickened out with a big ending he originally intended or someone stepped in and made him change it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the latter because the book does deal with some pretty controversial issues. Either way everything was tied up very nicely and all my questions were answered. But he also ended it in a way that sort of left it so you can also make your own decisions on what happened or what else will happen, I liked that a lot because I felt that it meant Pullman had a lot of trust in his readers.Once again Pullman's writing did not disappoint, he explained things without spelling them out but also so even those not well versed in religion, science or fantasy could understand what he was talking about. His vivid descriptions still survived well into the last page of this last book. And even though there was a lot of jumping around from character to character it was done smoothly so the reader wasn't annoyed or left feeling jarred out of place. All of his characters grew and became even more demensional, though it did make Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter a little more confusing... were they good or were they bad? I kind of enjoyed that delicate line they balanced on.I think one of the most wonderful parts in the story was Will and Lyra's relationship. It had to be treated so carefully because while they were still kids on the cusp of becoming adults, they had just been through so much that shaped them and had them grow. The relationship just didn't happen, there were hints scattered throughout so when they finally did get together you weren't seeing it as unbelievable, you were seeing it as something you knew was coming. It also wasn't too adult, it was perfect for them. Children that weren't quite children due to what they had just been through, but not quite adults due to their age. It was heartbreaking when they wouldn't be able to be together anymore because you knew it just wasn't a young first love, it was a true and deep love they more than likely won't find again. It was because their love was so raw and undying that they were able to change the Dust and help the worlds. It was honest, true love, the love that Mary explained to them, the \"forbidden fruit\" if you will.Overall I loved this series, every character was a joy unless they were specifically supposed to be cruel and unliked, and even then they weren't annoying and I wasn't finding myself wanting to skip past the pages they were in. The fact that Pullman was able to address so many issues (especially the ones about religion) without getting preachy or dry was another thing I think made the novels truly enjoyable. As a Christian I didn't feel the need to get defensive about how he represented God and religion altogether because he presented it in a fashion that while you believed it to be true in the world of the novels, you knew it wasn't an outright attack on the beliefs of many.In the end this was a fantastic series that was very much a worthwhile and enjoyable read. I don't think it's a series that's aimed towards a specific group of people because it encompasses so much. There is bound to be something within the novel you find and bond to that keeps you reading. And, personally, as much as they say it's a children's book, I think it's totally an adult read as well.

Pullman obviously finds it comforting that if they choose, dead people can now merge with the universe and be free, instead of being trapped below for eternity at the whim of some faraway authority.* I didn't remember either Mrs. Coulter or Lord Asriel being redeemed in the end, but they sort of are. And yet they also don't stop being terrible at the same time? I have very conflicting thoughts. * This is definitely just as scary as I remember it being, though it scared me in a different way as a teenager.* Lyra and Will's separation is agonizing. Even though it was the one thing I did remember from my two other reads and thus knew it was coming, it's just so utterly tragic. * There are gay angels in here! They both die, though, and one from a broken heart. I feel like maybe if this was written now, maybe he would have gone easier on them. Then again, everybody dies in this book except basically Lyra, Will, and Mary. So maybe not?* I always forget what animal Pantalaimon settles as. Why can't I hold that in my memory?

What I got instead was often frustrating and depressing. I'm not in the school of belief about sugarcoating everything for kids, but this almost seemed to shove the notion that life isn't fair down their throats. Unless you lie. Lying will get you ahead. This book did finally have some consequences for lying, but not nearly as much as their should be. It seems to glorify lying.Oh and religion is awful and anyone who believes in it is awful too. I'm not even religious, but I have many friends who are, and they wouldn't be my friends if they weren't great people. The level of preaching present in the last two books ramped up to a whole other level.The part that I liked the best was the middle, and the traveling to the land of the dead. I thought that was a really cool idea. This series had a lot of really cool ideas, but the execution of them just didn't work for me.The book, like the series wasn't all bad, I think my high expectations played a role in my being pretty underwhelmed.

This book is a lot more brutal than the past two were. See, e.g.: ---that scene where the cliff-ghast \"wrenched off the fox's head, and fought his brothers for the entrails,\" even though the fox told him what he wanted to hear---Iorek eating the corpse of his beloved friend Lee Scoresby, may he rest in peace (but what classic Pullman practicality, am I right? Why waste the meat?) ---the bit where Mrs. Coulter's golden monkey rips apart a live bat---the tualapi raiding the mulefa's village and defecating all over them when they finish, to add insult to injury---the dead villagers in Dirk Jansen's world, burned to death or with their throats cut, all of them (men, women, and little dead children) walking around desolately---the sad, creepy, despairing world of heaven, where everyone is parted from their daemon, their heart's friend, for eternityThis comment isn't specific to this book but to His Dark Materials generally: I fucking love the concept of Lyra as Eve and Mary Malone as the snake. (That said, am a little annoyed how murky this ended up playing out. How precisely did Mary tempt Lyra- the whole marzipan thing? And how did Lyra take this temptation- just with a kiss? And that gave the whole world knowledge? Hmm. Anyone have any answers here?)Another trilogy-general comment: global warming, gay couples, anti-colonialism, feminism. Man, Pullman was too politically trendy for the 90s. I love how gradually over the course of 3 books Pullman has completely and utterly forgotten that he's writing for children (\"mephitic\"? Really?) and I love it. Referring to Lyra as having \"Lyratic resolution\" warmed my heart for unknown reasons.Speaking of Lyra, I love her growth throughout the trilogy. And I love how both she and Mary Malone are just so down for whatever comes their way. Like, Mary's a nice Catholic nun, then she's physicist, then some little girl breaks into her office and solves her complicated physics problem, and Mary's all \"Oh, of cool, thanks strange child.\" Then she ends up in another dimension and meets some sentient diamond-shaped elephant-like people and totally goes native and they braid each others' hair and have sleepovers and plant trees together. And she just accepts all this as the natural order of things.Likewise, Lyra meets a dead zombie fella who's freaking out about the fact his throat is cut and he's, you know, dead, and her reaction? \"Hi zombie sir, I'm really sorry about being in your house. I know it's rude. My name's Lyra, what's yours?\" Lyra's walking around Hades surrounded by more dead zombies and a few super creepy living people, and her reaction? \"Oh hi everybody! My name's Lyra and I'm still alive. Sorry if that's rude to say to dead people, tee hee! We're real sorry to have arrived without any death, if that's the polite thing down here.\" Seriously, nothing fazes this kid.Speaking of the underworld. Only Phillip Pullman (well, and Pamela Dean) would throw a fucking classical \nkatabasis\n into children's literature. The whole underworld thing was phenomenally done. I love the idea of your deaths as being like daemons- your lifelong friend and companion, the gentle, loving one who escorts you to your end, not to be feared but to befriend and be kind to and to appreciate and love. I also loved the idea of true peace coming not from an artificial half-life like \"heaven\" where you're separated from your daemon, but rather from oblivion together, allowing your atoms to disperse back into the world of the living. \"And the last of Lee Scoresby passed through the heavy clouds and came out under the brilliant stars, where the atoms of his beloved daemon Hester were waiting for him.\"THAT SAID.This book needed aggressive editing. I'm not sure what happened here compared to the last two, but it was a good deal more rambling. The pace often failed entirely. The plot got lost in itself. And ultimately, I don't think the resolution of the trilogy-long conflict was truly resolved. The Eve/serpent thing and the fixing-the-currents-of-Dust thing was wildly untidy and just clumsy.But the ending- as heartbreaking as it was (no lie may have shed a tear) felt right and necessary and true to the series.

Which we will never see, since that would require the author showing us instead of telling us. The second quarter was just the daily lives of some short horned creatures and their own version of how life became sentient. Very nice fantasy-wise but otherwise useless to the plot.In the third quarter Lyra goes to the world of the dead because in the universe of the story it is just another world anyone can go to with the power of the knife. And you thought it wasn\u2019t broken enough already! So, she goes there to make all souls feel like rebelling and all it took was telling them this is not Heaven and God is evil. Yeah, ok; talk about being easy.After that we see the evil pope planning to kill Lyra. His name is Father MacPhail. The author is not even trying. Is the street outside his house named Path Etic? Is the car he\u2019s driving a Lame-ozine?Anyways, his evil Christian plan is to use a magic bomb that can kill you no matter where in the multiverse you might be. That is a seriously broken power. So why didn\u2019t they use it to kill her father, who has become the leader of the rebellion? Anyways, the bomb failed because obviously Lyra is the chosen one; we already know she wins at the end. More specifically she was informed in time and shaved her head. You see, the bomb was detecting the DNA from her hair and by shaving them, you can are no longer be detected. Since as we all know, DNA is limited to hair and has nothing to do with the rest of your body. The author is not even trying. After that, they take out God\u2019s no.2 man, by having Lyra\u2019s mother seducing him. An easy victory for a being that is trashing armies for fun. Also, this is the end of the greatest war of all times that they were hyping up for 3 books. It lasted 10 pages and it was about a MILF seducing an angel before stabbing him in the back and then killing God, who is a frail and powerless figure that can\u2019t even fight back. Because as we all know Dark Lords are powerless grandpas any mortal can kill with a simple knife. Talk about anti-climactic final showdowns.The epilogue is about the author telling us it is fine to have sex with random people without being married and giving up on religions because they expect you to die a virgin. Because that is exactly what Christianity is all about and has nothing to do with love and compassion. And that was His Dark Materials, the story of a pope named Mc Fail, a compass that tells you all you want instantly, a knife that teleports you anywhere you like, and the greatest war of all times being a MILF that seduces angels because illicit sex is fine.

And I came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do, not for what they are.\u201dReading and adoring The Golden Compass has left me with a very warm and nostalgic feeling when it comes to this series. Maybe that's why I'm so reluctant to admit that this last installment in Philip Pullman's beloved series left me with a very lukewarm feeling.Lyra has been taken by Ms Coulter and is kept asleep against her wishes. Will is on his own, and the carrier of a terrible knife with great power, that he is meant to bring to Lord Asriel. In the meantime, the worlds are merging together more and more, and as Will tries to find Lyra, a chase that crosses dimensions takes place.Honestly, I think Pullman tried to do too much. It was often confusing to be thrown around between the different perspectives, and some didn't make any sense at all - what did seeing through Asshat Asrie actually bring to the story? Bringing in so many different characters, small plots and stakes made me expect the ending to be a big great bang, but instead it just sizzled out.Another thing that really bothered me was the romance. Why was it necessary? Why couldn't Lyra and Will just love each other platonically? Not only did it feel unnecessary, but it actually made me uncomfortable - wasn't Lyra like twelve? Basically, I really didn't need to read about these children longing for each others touch, and liked it way more when they just had a great friendship between them.Other than that, Pullman's writing was beautiful and always, and there is a lot one can quote. I really also enjoy his dissection of religion and how he weaves that together with fantastical elements.

I sometimes really enjoy the first, but just don\u2019t get around to finishing the rest. Point in case - I gave a rare 5 star to both The Hunger Games AND The Golden Compass but then both of the rest of the series\u2019 sat on my shelf for over 2 years. I\u2019ve never really understood the reason why they haven't appealed to me - but after completing both series over the last month, & being so horribly disappointed in both - I have decided I really ought to just trust my instincts & not bother. The first in this series The Golden Compass was an outstanding book in my opinion. The whole concepts of daemons was totally original - & bizarrely enough, almost kind of relatable. Mrs Coulter is deliciously malevolent & the alethiometer is fascinating. Like most good young adult books, its strength lay in the simplicity of the story & the excellent world building. I liked Lyra & I was totally engaged in her world. Then came The Subtle Knife. I was disappointed in this straight away - its like a totally different book! Lyra becomes a side character - daemons are suddenly barely relevant - there is a whole host of new characters & side stories that are supposedly leading to somewhere - so whatever\u2026. Obviously Mr Pullman had a completely different concept for this story - it was frustrating but the writing is still reasonable & the story (while confusing) is still ok.But this\u2026. wow\u2026 This flaws in the book are vast and numerous. Firstly, its waaaay too long. 520 pages is long for an adult book - but for the target audience, its just crazy - especially when most of it is pure filler. I admit to skimming a good 1oo pages of this because it was just utterly tedious and a huge chore.There are far too many characters! A lot more are introduced in this book (important characters!) but I couldnt have cared less about any of them by this point, or even fathom the purpose of most of them. There is ZERO character development and nobody has any personality at all. Will & especially Lyra are just hollow shadows of their former selves. Mrs Coulter's flip flop is beyond ludicrous & she goes from being on of the most interesting characters in the series to one of the most boring .The plot is totally confusing. I can honestly say I didn\u2019t really have a clue as to what the hell was actual going on. The over-complicated plot lines are totally disengaging. Mary Malone's side story is pointless & takes up a huge portion of the book. Other than being obviously anti - church, I just don\u2019t think Philip Pullman had any ideas where this story was going & just kept adding in extra plots that sounded kind of interesting in an effort to grab readers. I really have no idea what dust was supposed to be & what about all those angels? Why was it suddenly so important to go to the land of the dead? - important enough to leave their daemons behind?!! What about Wills mother & the people chasing him? Just like the folded paper, plot points are left hanging, others have gone in different directions & none of this made any sense. I don\u2019t get it & I don\u2019t care enough to think about trying to get it. Its like one of those huge blockbuster films with a crap storyline but heaps of special effects. I always hated those films\u2026 give me low budget with a good script any day. An Will & Lyra\u2019s true love? What? - Puh -lease!!! They\u2019re 12 yrs old!!! Apparently a lot of people have a problem with the anti religious themes in the book. I rarely care if an author has a political or religious motivation, in fact I tend to think that a lot of people overthink these things. For example, the amount of readers who are offended by racism in books that were written over 100 years ago in a totally different cultural climate is bizarre to me\u2026 for crying out loud just take the story in its context!!But I digress\u2026 Reading for me is first & foremost about entertainment, and as long as I am entertained, I don\u2019t really care what the personal motivation of the author is. I do however, have a problem with crappy writing. On a personal level, I understand the aversion to organised religion, I just don\u2019t get why its was so bad in the context of this book. I mean we\u2019re told its bad, but where is the evidence of it in the narrative? I can come on board with the concept - but you have to show me why I should believe something - not just tell me I should. The last 60 pages or so ARE pretty heavy handed but to be honest, by the time I got half way through this \tbook I was so utterly bored & disengaged that I couldn\u2019t even have cared.

It\u2019s also the only book that\u2019s ever made me cry \u2013 the ending left me distraught, but it was beautiful. Of course, you should read each of the books in the series for maximum enjoyment, as you can only really fully appreciate the end of the series if you\u2019ve been there since the start.I don\u2019t want to talk directly about the plot here, because it follows on from the other two books and so if you haven\u2019t read those yet, there\u2019ll be spoilers. What I can say, though, is that in this book, all of the little story lines are wrapped up, and you\u2019re in from a gripping tale from start to finish, which crosses the boundaries of multiple worlds. Along the way, you\u2019ll meet some new characters and some old ones, and you\u2019ll see some of those same characters get ruthlessly murdered by Pullman like he\u2019s impersonating George R. R. Martin. But it works.We also learn a lot more about the nature of Dust, thanks to Mary Malone, an underrated character who turns out to be surprisingly important. Couple that with a huge, all-out war between Lord Asriel and the Authority, as well as a quick visit to the world of the dead, and you can see how you might be in for a treat. And this despite it being the weaker of the three books in the trilogy, in my opinion \u2013 Northern Lights was easily my favourite, in case you\u2019re wondering.This book, and the other books in the series, are examples of those rare books that blow your mind \u2013 I almost find it hard to believe that a mere mortal could\u2019ve created a book something as powerful as this. For me, Pullman\u2019s world-building is more vivid and evocative than that of almost any other writer, with the possible exception of Sir Terry Pratchett \u2013 Tolkien and C. S. Lewis don\u2019t even stand a chance. But then, without them, the His Dark Materials trilogy might not have existed \u2013 there are certainly parallels, such as the ability to pass from one world to another, but Pullman makes them his own.The characterisation is also exceptional, and it\u2019s interesting to watch the subtle changes in Lyra and Will as they grow from children to young adults, and how those changes influence their decisions and, ultimately, the story line. Their daemons change as well, which is interesting \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the way that Pullman managed to make humans and their daemons both similar and different. It helps to make them believable, and it also adds an extra level to the story because a human and their daemon might not always agree on things.Overall, this book comes highly recommended from me, but so do the other two books in the series.

In your first two installments, you portrayed many of the same ideas--subtly crafting them into the story and characters, building your case in the background. In Amber Spyglass, it appears you've grown weary of that backgroundy-subtle stuff. Whatever, obvious agendas don't always ruin a story, Orwell and Bradbury did it fine. BUT, and here is where I sadly click the only two stars to commemorate the end of what was a most promising and magical tale: You can't sacrifice the story or the characters to your agenda. You can't have the characters make decisions that don't seem to match the character you've so carefully crafted just because it gets your point across.

Welcome to Cassi @ My Thoughts Literally and I's first joint review for our His Dark Material Re-Read. This will be happening all December long so if you want to join in PLEASE DO SO! Here is the schedule we are following! \nThe Golden Compass Nov 30- Dec 5\n\n\nThe Subtle Knife Dec 7-12\n\n\nThe Amber Spyglass Dec 14-19.\n\nHere we go...\n\n\n\u00a0 Our Review: \nFirst things first, how do you feel?\n\n\nB: \n  Feel?! My feel is broken and crying in the corner.\n  \n\nC: \n  DON\u2019T LOOK AT ME! No I mean i\u2019m definitely feeling the book hangover kicking in and I\u2019m a little devastated by the way it all ended but I love this series so much and rereading it was so fantastic that I\u2019m also really happy. I just have a lot of feelings!\n  \n\nSo how long has it been since you first read the book? \n\n\n  B: 2010? I don't know but I was majorly pregnant and this whole thing and raging emotions is not a cocktail you want to try.\n  \n\n  C: Seven year ago. I marathoned the whole series then.\n  \n\nWhat did you think about the book when you read it the first time?\n\n\n  C: I absolutely loved it. This is my favorite book in the series. It\u2019s so intense and with all these complex plot points and themes. \n  \n\n  B: I was very mad at myself for thinking this to be a childish series, it is really anything but.\n  \n\nDo you like it more or less than the first two books in the series?\n\n\n  C: More. Like I said, this is my favorite book in the series.\n  \n\n  B: Agreed absolutely more...there is just soooo much.\n  \n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part?\n\n\n  B: KFKFKAKAJEHHHRTIOGOGLKGKKMYHPPPOAOAKWKWMEMT!! Roger\u2026.that is all I'll say.\n  \n\n  C: This is a totally impossible question for this book. Because I have so many bittersweet feelings for this book a lot of my favorite moments also have really positive feelings around. Like I really like the part in the Land of the Dead but I also sob during that part. And the end after Lyra and Will meet Mary Malone again but as much as I love their interaction and ship it so hard we all all know how that ends.\n  \n\nDo you have a least favorite part?\n\n\n  C: Maybe some stuff with Mary Malone and the mulefa. I see how they come in at the end but there\u2019s a bit too much exposition in a final book for me to really like them. There are also some stuff with Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter in the middle of the book that I don\u2019t like. Just in general I think, the parts where we cut away from Lyra and Will in the Land of the Dead. I posted on Goodreads how I was annoyed that there were two chapters in a row without them because I needed to know what happened to them and I didn\u2019t care about mulefa or intention crafts.\n  \n\n  B: Ughhh yes! I mean I really enjoyed the whole \u201cthis world evolution went this way\u201d but there was just a bit much. And yes Cassi I think I began to skim at first cause I was ahh Will & Lyra where are you?!\n  \n\nSpeaking of the Land of the Dead, in this book the characters go to speak to loved ones. If you could go there and speak to some who would it be?\n\n\n  C: I have a few relatives who passed away suddenly. If I could talk to them to say goodbye I would probably do it.\n  \n\n \t  Ughhh this kills me. I would absolutely speak to my mother since she was gone suddenly and while we were fighting no less. Also my grandfather I said goodbye to him it that doesn't stop me from missing him terribly.  \nDid you like the way it ended?\n\n\n \t  I do of course there are some thing I wanted\u2026...more of but all in all this was a perfect ending. Not too happy and not too sad. Cassi actually explains it perfectly!  \n  C: I did. I do. Of course it wrecks me every single time, it\u2019s so bittersweet and I wish it were happy but I think it works. I like when the final book in a series has a really intricate plot. Like how stuff from the first few books that seemed small now have big affects on the plot. I think that happens here. It all ends in a perfect way but with things that I want to happen not happening. Like I said, bittersweet\n  \n\nWhat about the characters? Still love them?\n\n\n  C: Of course. Lyra and Will are some of my all-time favorite characters. They show such strength and determination plus they\u2019re really well rounded. They have strengths and weaknesses which is always my favorite. I also really like Mrs. Coulter in this book. And not like love to hate, like actually enjoy. I think she has really great character development and a redemptive arc which is my favorite. Can we still be friends?\n  \n\n  B: I can't believe I am about to say this but Mrs. coulter did end up okay in my book\u2026.I guess. Will and Lyra are of course my heart. Also Mr Scorsby!!\n  \n\nAny new characters that you like or want to talk about? \n\n\n  C: Yes! The Gallivespians, especially Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia. I love them. They\u2019re these tiny spies that ride around on hawks and dragonflies. They come from a different world and start out as antagonists towards Lyra and Will but end up helping them. I think they are so cool.\n  \n\n \t  Oh yes definitely the Gallivespians! Don't forget the best part is that they have tiny Spurs on their shoes that the stab people which which is poison! There really are the perfect spies.   \nCan we talk about the relationships? Especially the romance between Lyra and Will. You ship it right?\n\n\nB: \n  It is a brief romance but it is so sweet in first love that smacks you in the face kind of way. I think you could see how much they loved each other long before they realized it and long after as well. I mean you don't follow someone into the world of the dead if you're not like head over heels for them right?!\n  \n\nC: \n  I ship it so hard. Like it\u2019s next level OTP for me. One of my all-time favorites. The part at the end when they\u2019re all couply, I love it so much. And like my followers and you know, I\u2019m romancephobic. I usually could do without romance in my fantasies. But I think with this one it kind of has a connection with the plot and themes of the book, so it works. Plus the way it all ends just makes me want it to happen even more. *sobs*\n  \n\nWhat did you think about the audiobook?\n\n\n  C: Amazing, seriously amazing. I keep saying how much I like the fact that it\u2019s a full cast. That\u2019s such a brilliant format and I really want to listen to more of them. I also mentioned to Britt that it sounded like Will\u2019s voice changed like he went through puberty and it kind of fit perfectly for the story. And in the post for the first book I talked about how the narration from Philip Pullman didn\u2019t always work, how I wanted him to talk fasting during the exciting parts. This time that was perfect. He sped up during the big scenes and it pulled me in and got the adrenaline flowing. It was so great and I\u2019m glad I listened to the audio for the reread.\n  \n\n  B: It was very well done. Thank goodness for Cassi urging me to get an audible membership. So worth it!\n  \n\nSo this was a reread, did you get more out of the book? Notice things you missed the first time?\n\n\n  B: Oh yes! I was constantly tweeting Cassi and sayin \u201c oh my god I can't believe I forgot so and so\u201d. They were some pretty huge plot points to but my memory is the worst so it's not surprising.\n  \n\n  C: I did. I remembered most of what happened in this book but it was big picture stuff. I remembered the Land of the Dead, the fact that mulefas existed, and the stuff with the Clouded Mountain but the little details and how they got there I totally forgot about.\n  \n\nSo now that it\u2019s over, what comes next?\n\n\nB: \n  I cry in the corner for a week and try to see my daemon.\n  \n\nC: \n  I really want to reread all over again. But that will destroy my TBR more than it already has and I have 2016 ARCs side eyeing me. Instead I\u2019m thinking that I will read all the short stories that are part of this world. There\u2019s Lyra\u2019s Oxford which takes place years in the future, Once Upon a Time in the North which is the prequel about Iorek and Lee Scorsby, and The Collectors which I think is about Mrs. Coulter and her daemon. Have you read any of these Britt?\n  \n\n  B: You know I haven't but I always eye them. I think we should totes make this a holiday tradition. Those stories would be nice to read like mid year or perhaps before. Have you ever heard the name of Mrs. Coulter\u2019s daemon? They always just call him the golden monkey. I'd like to find that out for sure!\n  \n\n\n\n Make sure to head over to Cassi's My Thoughts Literally as well! She always has super insightful reviews and her gif game blows me away!

You have to work. Did you think you could snap your fingers, and have it as a gift? What is worth having is worth working for.\"\nSo much happens in the His Dark Materials series that it's hard to tell how much time passes. This is good because you get lost in the story, but it also means that some of the events at the end feel slightly uncomfortable. In \nNorthern Lights\n, Lyra is a child, and Will, though he seems older than Lyra when we meet him in \nThe Subtle Knife\n, still seems awfully young. Especially since their daemons haven't settled, and this all starts with kids Lyra's age being experimented on because they are children. And yes, this series is a retelling of Adam and Eve, so we know where this is all going, but it still felt icky once we got there. (view spoiler)[Especially because there is very little description about what goes on between Lyra and Will, it hints at it being a lot more than just a chaste kiss to cement their love after everything they've been through together. (hide spoiler)]\n\"Maybe sometimes we don't do the right thing because the wrong thing looks more dangerous, and we don't want to look scared, so we go and do the wrong thing just because it's dangerous. We're more concerned with not looking scared than with judging right.\"\nPhilip Pullman had a lot of threads to pull together here, and I think he did an incredible job. A biblical retelling in multiple worlds from different perspectives is a lot to try together in three books. It was more interesting than meaningful for me, considering I'm not religious, but I can certainly admire the work that went into this series.\n\"'Lyra Silvertongue, what is this plan to visit the dead?''It came to me in a dream, Iorek. I saw Roger's ghost, and I knew he was calling to me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0You remember Roger. Well, after we left you, he was killed, and it was my fault, at least I felt it was. And I think I should just finish what I began, that's all: I should go and say sorry, and if I can, I should rescue him from there. If Will can open a way to the world of the dead, then we must do it.''Can is not the same as must.''But if you must and you can, then there's no excuse.''While you are alive, your business is with life.''No, Iorek,' she said gently, 'our business is to keep promises, no matter how difficult they are. You know, secretly, I'm deadly scared. And I wish I'd never had that dream, and I wish Will hadn't thought of using the knife to go there. But we did, so we can't get out of it.'\"\nAs is a pretty common theme in the His Dark Materials series, there are so many heartbreaking moments in \nThe Amber Spyglass\n. By this point, there are so many worlds and characters that it didn't feel like we got to spend enough time with any of them. Even saying that, though, I'm still upset over the loss of some of the best characters earlier in the series.\n\"'When you stopped believing in God,' he went on, 'did you stop believing in good and evil?''No. But I stopped believing there was a power of good and a power of evil that were outside us. And I came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do, not for what they are. All we can say is that this is a good deed, because it helps someone, or that's an evil one, because it hurts them. People are too complicated to have simple labels.'\"\nIt took me a long time to get through \nThe Amber Spyglass\n. As I said at the beginning, it felt incredibly dense and not as enjoyable as the first two books. I think I was more removed and interested rather than immersed and hooked. The narrative felt much more abstract, like a theological thought experiment - which I'm happy to read, it's just going to take longer.\n\"'I was flying high,' she explained, 'looking for a landfall, and I met an angel: a female angel. She was very strange; she was old and young together [...] Her name was Xaphania. She told me many things\u00a0\u2026\u00a0She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed. She gave me many examples from my world.''I can think of many from mine.''And for most of that time, wisdom has had to work in secret, whispering her words, moving like a spy through the humble places of the world while the courts and palaces are occupied by her enemies.'\"\nLuckily, I've only just realised that there are several accompanying short stories/novellas for this series, as well as an entirely separate but related series! So I'm pretty excited to get to see more of Lyra (and fingers crossed for some Will as well?), especially some stories that I get to read with fresh eyes rather than as rereads. I hope they're more like the first two books in this series and less like this last one.\"I will love you forever, whatever happens.

This is a deep book. There's a lot going on in here, some of it's really meta, some of it's plain weird - but it has some great characters, fantastic locations and magical moments.Before I get stuck in, here's the quick free plug. I write, mainly fantasy to be precise. The best place to start if you're interested in my books is the first book of my fantasy series:-\n\nRight! Onto the review!The first thing that struck me during this second read of this series is the transistions. Book 1 is very much a separate entity to the others. It's focused exclusively on Lyra's world. A world where every person has a manifestation of their inner self accompanying themselves at all times in an animal form. Childen's daemons can change shape, reflecting the fact that WHO THEY ARE is something, which isn't entirely set and can be altered. Adults daemons settle on a shape and that shape is a representation of the sort of person they are. Now when I read this the first time, I found this to be a VERY weird concept. But interesting. I also found Lyra to be an annoying brat. However, on the second read, it all made sense. And knowing of the trials Lyra is going to go through and how she grows as a person throughout... Well, that makes her a very likable character. She comes across as a plucky underdog on the second read.The transition between book 1 and 2 is VERY clear.Between 2 and 3 it isn't so though. Book 2 starts by quickly introducing you do the secondary character of the series - Will. One of my favourite characters of any book. He's very different to Lyra and their personalities truly complement each other. They have different strengths and weaknesses. We're also introduced to Mary Mallone, and her story is really pretty weird. I could take it or leave it to be honest. But Will and Lyra's story makes the whole book worth the read.I always remember book 2 'The Subtle Knife' as being my favourite, but the truth is I think parts of 2 AND 3 are my favourites, the second and third books kind of blend together. The story starts here with Lyra asleep in the cave with her mother, the devilish Mrs Coulter.A great scene is the confrontation between Iorek Byrnisson the armoured bear and Will. It perfectly portrayed the strengths of two very complicated characters. Interesting that Iorek, begrudgingly repaired the knife. I forgot about the breaking of the knife. I still don't quite understand how it broke. The answer has to be something to do with the state of mind the knife-bearer has to be in to make a cut. Is this a metaphor for something? One thing I would say, is that Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter often come across as overpowered characters. They can both at times appear to have almost god-like, deus-ex-machina powers. Such as taming the spectres. That really DIDN'T sit well with me.The idea that Iorek could repair the knife in a cave over an open fire... Well that sounds ridiculous, but Pullman writes the scene so well, so convincingly that it's okay. A key point about Mrs Coulter throughout this book is she almost ALWAYS seems dangerous. The only time she appears to be on the back foot is when she visits the Magisterium and has a lock of hair stolen for the weird homing bomb thing. One huge part of this book, which I particularly enjoyed, was the sojourn into the land of the dead. It's dark, eerie and tragic. An interesting idea, that everyone has their own anthropomorphism of death. It's a very metaphysical section. The end destination for the deceased before Lyra's intervention was a place of true despair that would make Hell seem pleasant. However some zealots claimed to believe it was their paradise? It calls into question the benefits of existing in some form for eternity. Of course when Lyra and Will enter the land of the dead, they have to leave their daemons. This is tough for them, and it affects the little Gallivespians too. What this is a metaphor for - I don't know, but I feel like it has real meaning. The changes Lyra and Will bring about to the land of the dead are quite profound. The religious side of the book gets even weirder during this book. It leaves you with an impression that god has failed. That he was only ever a pretender, and that someone more powerful, but also more malign has taken over. You empathise with Lord Asriel and his forces. You can appreciate why he wants to take on Metatron and the forces of Heaven. However his use of Roger's death to create the bridge was hard to forgive. Even sacrificing themselves to oblivion doesn't really give Mrs Coulter and Asriel absolution. What makes this book and this series magical is partly the journey. The characters travel to so many varied and interesting places! The worlds they visit are fascinating. The bigger strength of this book and this series is the characters. Lyra and Will are great. It's a very hard to put down book when you're reading their sections. Lee Scoresby, Iorek, Serafina Pekkala, John Parr, even the Lady Salmakia and her partner - the Galivespians who accompany Will and Lyra. It's book bursting with fascinating, complex characters. When I started the Book of Dust, I'll be honest I was a little disappointed to discover it's a prequel rather than a sequel. HOWEVER, I do really like Malcolm. He's a great character!The most striking and shocking thing about the book, the thing that stays with you for a long time is the ending. In many ways, all the metaphysical stuff aside, this series is about growing up. The characters go off on this amazing adventure which spans continents, worlds and even dimensions. Then at the end of it, they have to give up everything. The people they care about, the places they've visited. It's all in such a way that they have to say goodbye forever. If this doesn't give you the feels, then you really do have a heart of stone. I think part of the lesson is to treasure the good times you HAVE had with people, because nothing lasts forever. Humans, relationships... These are finite things. We have to enjoy the moment, accept the situation we're in and make the best of it. Even though at times it will be crushingly difficult to do so...I love this book, I love this series. I still maintain I enjoyed the first book the least, but it's well worth reading to give the second and third books context. I also think this is a series that everyone should read at least twice. There's too much complex stuff going on in this series for it to make sense the first time through.Fantastic work from Phillip Pullman, can't wait to get stuck into 'La Belle Sauvage(The Book of Dust)'Lastly, I know some people love Mary. I kind of like her and it's nice that Will has a friend he can talk to about what happened... But really? I didn't enjoy the Mulefa sections. Whenever I came to one, I groaned internally and checked forwards to see how long before I got back to the story I WANTED to read. It might just be me. There's nothing bad about Mary and her journey - I just didn't find it anywhere near as interesting. Sorry. The rest of the book MORE than makes up for it though!Martyn StanleyAuthor of:-The Last Dragon Slayer", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "18122.The_Amber_Spyglass", "book_id": "18122", "book_title": "The Amber Spyglass", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2253389493", "review_id": "2253389493", "date": "Feb 16, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Paul", "user_url": "/user/show/4882193-paul", "text": "I recently read the first installment of \"The Book of Dust,\" a new Philip Pullman trilogy, and afterward decided to re-read Pullman's earlier trilogy, \"His Dark Materials.\" I have now finished the last of those three, \"The Amber Spyglass.\" The first time I read them, I had not yet begun reviewing books on Goodreads or my blog, so these reviews are new, and concentrate on their status as challenged and banned books.Pullman published the \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy in the 1990s, and the books were quickly the subject of challenges and bans, primarily in schools but in some cases bookstores and public libraries as well. Objections to the books centered around a perceived anti-religion theme, as well as the author's professed atheism. Since the books were written for a younger audience, they were seen as subversive. I was surprised to learn that the entire trilogy still appears on the American Library Association's 2016 list of the top 100 banned and challenged books (a fact that suggests the new trilogy will join the first on future ALA top 100 lists).I mentioned in my review of the second \"His Dark Materials\" novel, \"The Subtle Knife,\" that parents sometimes object to the darkness of some young adult fiction, and that darkness may have been an unspoken reason for some of the opposition to these books, beyond the open opposition to their anti-religion theme and the author's atheism. I must say, \"The Amber Spyglass\" is dark indeed, as dark as anything in classical literature.Here, in the last novel, the anti-religion theme comes to a head with a final battle between the first angel and his forces and Lord Asriel and his, but really between the first angel and the child protagonists, who are fulfilling a strange destiny, unknown to them and only vaguely known to prophets. And there is, thank God, light at the end of their long, dark, twisted journey.You notice I referenced God. The books are anti-religion. I never thought they were anti-God. In fact, and this is not meant as a spoiler, \"His Dark Materials\" ends with the creation of a new Heaven, a Heaven on Earth.This will seem a bit of a detour, but the Harry Potter saga wore me out as the story reached the drawn-out climax of the war between Harry and Lord Voldemort. It was just too bloody much. Not only that, the story became ever more fantastical, and really the only thing that kept me going was my affection for Harry and his band of close friends.That's how I feel about the second two volumes of \"His Dark Materials,\" \"The Subtle Knife\" and \"The Amber Spyglass.\" My affection for Lyra is what kept me going; indeed, that affection is what draws me to the new trilogy, and I can't wait for Pullman to write and publish the rest of it. That he can create such a character is his particular genius.One last observation: although the books are categorized as young adult science fiction and fantasy, I want to point out that I am now in my 70s, and that I find myself profoundly affected by them, maybe even more so on a second reading. I can only imagine what their impact might be on teenaged readers. It must be profound indeed. Parents and authority figures who don't want children to question what they're told must be mighty nervous about books like these. Subversive?

This was just a mess. The story begins straight after the last one but takes the problems I had from the second book and dials them up. Characters go places for no real reason except for 'plot'. Honestly what was the whole point of going to the land of the dead? And the reason for such came from nowhere and was never explained. I was bored for most of it. Even the exciting bits were fairly blah and made not much sense either. Mrs Coulter was the strangest. She went from the genuinely scary character in the first book to being besotted about Lyra and changing her whole viewpoint. Now this could be good and interesting but it felt unearned and jarring. Lyra and Will weren't bad, and some of their emotional moments were quite good but were let down by the meandering plot. I actually quite liked Mary's story but again it didn't really do anything except give us a bit more detail about Dust but it took up like a quarter of the book. And the end. Oh my god the end. Still makes no sense to me. I'm not quite sure what the author was on about. The whole series got more like a sledgehammer to the head in relation to his feelings about organised religion but I have no idea what he was trying to say with the end. (view spoiler)[ So two thirteen(?) year olds have sex and then the universe is suddenly put right again? (hide spoiler)]. Did I read that part correct? I don't know, that was pretty messed up when you think on it. Maybe if I'd read this when I was young I would be seeing this series very differently but I thought it got worse as it continued. Don't get me wrong, there were some great moments here but they were lost in a stew of a plot.

I definitely felt connected to the characters (mostly Will, as an only child that doesn't take any BS) and felt excited to jump back into the story every time. I think the reason it took me so long to read the series is because I wanted to soak in every detail and that needed full concentration because a LOT went on.I can't say I loooved the ending to this 3rd book unfortunately... it fell a little flat for me, like things were missing, and this book became WAY too religious for my liking. Also all the mushy love stuff... not for me either. Can't really say anything else without spoilers!BUT I did definitely enjoy it overall and the ending was wrapped up nice enough.

I could imagine this mystical world similar to our own, but filled with courageous children, daemons, armored bears, and mysterious dust. I enjoyed the second book, but the feisty Lyra starts to lose the limelight to the more stereotypical \u201chero figure,\u201d Will. The third follows this downward trend. Lyra\u2019s character becomes a shadow of her former self. Another main character changes significantly, out of the blue. New beings are introduced that do not add anything to the storyline. The author completely disregards important elements already established, changing them in ways that made no sense to me. The finale did not take me to a place I recognized from the first two books. The storytelling is disjointed \u2013 it jolts along with major new components thrown in constantly all the way up to the anticlimactic ending. There was so much potential here.

While I remember loving the series as a teen, I remembered very little of The Amber Spyglass, and upon reading it again more than a decade later I suspect it is because of the slow pace and unremarkable details that bogs down the book.

On the other hand, I do love Pullman's imagination, and his vivid characterizations - Lyra's inherent stubborn and manipulating nature, the force of Lord Asriel's, and the laconic Lee Scoresby.
