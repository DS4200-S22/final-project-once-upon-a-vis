I can see why people wouldn't like it - I really can. Perhaps because I took a lot out of it personally, I found I enjoyed it a lot.Quick test to see if you'll like this book:1. Did you like Anne of Green Gables?2. Can you cope with an off-beat, melancholy, caustic, dead-pan, self-righteous narrator?3. Do you like words?(Questions 4-8 were all about what kind of underwear you're wearing so don't worry about them).So, let's all gather around for story time with Mistress Kat.Two incidents set me off lately.1.\tMy neighbour came to me and complained about the Islanders (for those not Australian: the Tongan, Fiji, Papa New Guinea and New Zealand populations of Australia) causing trouble and otherwise defiling our great and beautiful nation.2.\tI was tooling around on Facebook when I noticed one of my friends (one of those friends you\u2019ve never met except in an internet community) hosting a link to a video of a speech from a man addressing the American people. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that he is reminiscent of a neo-Hitler but let\u2019s just say that the comparison would not be wholly unearned. Her comments on the video were that: everything he\u2019d said was right, it was time that people sat up and listened for the sake of their country and that it\u2019s about time \u201csomebody did something\u201d. (Fuck me, I\u2019ve heard this phrase so many times. What is it exactly that they\u2019re referring to? Do they actually know? I\u2019ve yet to hear them pronounce what this \u201csomething\u201d is or what it looks like. Is there some plan that I\u2019m not aware of that they\u2019re referring to? Does it involve chipmunks, honey and tequila?)To my neighbour, I simply mumbled that I had to leave and got in my car. I was offended on behalf of my friends so I blew him off and I haven\u2019t really spoken to him since. To my Facebook friend, I resisted the urge to make any comments. I debated about starting a fight that would, in all likelihood, spill over to our community. In the end I ignored her and I haven\u2019t spoken to her since.The Book Thief is not your typical WWII story. It doesn\u2019t even ask you to sympathize with the Jews. Their plight is background to the story and their struggles and pains are rarely shown except through the pitiful/beautiful character of Max. This story actually focuses on the bad guys. Zusak assumes that you know about the struggle and the plight of the Jews. He assumes that you feel for them, that you are horrified on their behalf and so he doesn\u2019t spend much time eliciting an emotion that you are expected to have.Instead it focuses on the BAD guys. You get to know and live the lives of a small and poor town in Germany. The thing is, though, that these aren\u2019t really the bad guys. Zusak, probably rightly, assumes that we\u2019d never be able to really empathize and enjoy reading a book about characters truly bad. They\u2019re not really bad. After all, they may be Germans and they may have escaped persecution and death, but they\u2019re still poor. They\u2019re the tiny fraction of the German population who sympathizes with the Jews. They harbour a Jewish man in their home and come to love him. The thing is though that for most of the novel, they\u2019re not the good guys either. They don\u2019t speak up for the Jewish people, they don\u2019t try to change popular opinion, they don\u2019t stand for what\u2019s right. They quietly try to get by without causing waves and without risking much of themselves.So you can see how I would sympathize. How could I think that I\u2019m one of the \u201cgood guys\u201d when I don\u2019t stand up for people either? Shouldn\u2019t I have challenged my neighbour and asked how he knew that the Islanders were to blame for all the crime? Shouldn\u2019t I have asked him how many Islanders he knew? How he could make such assumptions about people? Shouldn\u2019t I have challenged my facebook friend? Shouldn\u2019t I have asked her why she\u2019s spreading propaganda? Couldn\u2019t I have probed her to think critically about this man\u2019s claims, about facts and ethics? No. I didn\u2019t want to cause problems and I didn\u2019t want to make waves.The narrator of The Book Thief makes a claim that Hitler\u2019s took over a country and started a war \u2013 not with guns or weapons but with words. I\u2019ve read others consider this claim to be stupid and ridiculous but I actually agree with him. When I was a child I asked my Great Aunt Nell why she insisted on engaging me in long and tedious hypothetical debates about morality, human nature, ethics and theology. Her response was always the same: if you don\u2019t fill a child\u2019s head with all the right stuff, someone will come along and fill it with all the wrong stuff. It\u2019s kind of like those corny motivational quotes that the teachers post in their rooms: Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.Well, I agree. When you don\u2019t educate people, when you don\u2019t teach them to think critically, with full understanding and proper knowledge, then other people come along and whisper in their ear and fill their heads up with mindless rot. Hitler told the German people how to think. He told them who was Wrong. Why they were Wrong. How to fix the Wrong. What was Right. Then he did the most powerful thing a person could do: he told them a story. When you tell a whole nation a story about the future \u2013 a gloriously bright future with Plenty and Joy; a future in which they are redeemed and have conquered their enemies; a future in which they are happy and Everything Is As It Should Be \u2013 and if you tell that story well enough, then you can conquer a country and wage a war without ever firing a single bullet. Coincidently when you don\u2019t speak up, when you don\u2019t proclaim the truth, when you\u2019re too afraid to replace ignorance with knowledge then you\u2019re no better than an accomplice to a crime. I can\u2019t imagine how my friends would feel if they\u2019d known that I stood by and allowed them and their family and children to be slandered like that. Pretty appalled, I imagine \u2013 and rightfully so.And now we come to the big reason why I think a lot of people didn\u2019t like this book \u2013 the narrator.The Hunger Games did a similar thing to The Book Thief. It sought to instil in its readers a sense of proper shame. However, as opposed to The Book Thief, you didn\u2019t feel judged. After all, for the Sins that The Hunger Games was preaching of, we\u2019re all guilty \u2013 and in our combined guilt there seems to be a lessening of accountability. Perhaps there\u2019s a sense that we\u2019re all going down together. When we\u2019re damned, at least we\u2019ll have good company, right? The Book Thief, however, singles you out as solely responsible. It strips you naked and looks down on you as it asks you to account of yourself. Not even the narrator can sympathize with you because he is the only one left blameless and innocent, looking upon us with a reserved kind of pity and bewilderment. Maybe I\u2019m a glutton for punishment. I don\u2019t mind being stripped down. I don\u2019t mind being reprimanded and so I loved this book. I loved this book for inspiring me to be even more outlandishly outspoken and persistently and doggedly forthcoming on my opinions of these issues. I loved this book because I loved the narrator. I loved this book because I loved the story. I loved this book because I now have the PERFECT excuse to start a helluva lot more fights. For some reason, that thought makes me very happy.", "num_likes": 779, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["australian-writer", "contemporary-fiction", "i-learned-something-new", "kat-s-book-reviews"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/387598058", "review_id": "387598058", "date": "Aug 09, 2012", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Sophia.", "user_url": "/user/show/6520961-sophia", "text": "THE BOOK THIEF: A Summary.

I absolutely loved it.Set in Germany in the years 1939-1943, The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel, narrated by Death who has in his possession the book she wrote about these years. So, in a way, they are both book thieves. Liesel steals randomly at first, and later more methodically, but she's never greedy. Death pockets Liesel's notebook after she leaves it, forgotten in her grief, amongst the destruction that was once her street, her home, and carries it with him.Liesel is effectively an orphan. She never knew her father, her mother disappears after delivering her to her new foster parents, and her younger brother died on the train to Molching where the foster parents live. Death first encounters nine-year-old Liesel when her brother dies, and hangs around long enough to watch her steal her first book, The Gravedigger's Handbook, left lying in the snow by her brother's grave.Her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Herbermann, are poor Germans given a small allowance to take her in. Hans, a tall, quiet man with silver eyes, is a painter (of houses etc.) and plays the accordian. He teaches Liesel how to read and write. Rosa is gruff and swears a lot but has a big heart, and does laundry for rich people in the town. Liesel becomes best friends with her neighbour Rudy, a boy with \"hair the colour of lemons\" who idolises the black Olympic champion sprinter Jesse Owens. One night a Jew turns up in their home. He's the son of a friend of Hans from the first world war, the man who taught him the accordian, whose widowed wife Hans promised to help if she ever needed it. Hans is a German who does not hate Jews, though he knows the risk he and his family are taking, letting Max live in the basement. Max and Liesel become close friends, and he writes an absolutely beautiful story for her, called The Standover Man, which damn near broke my heart. It's the story of Max, growing up and coming to Liesel's home, and it's painted over white-painted pages of Mein Kampf, which you can see through the paint.Whenever I read a book, I cannot help but read it in two ways: the story itself, and how it's written. They're not quite inseparable, but they definitely support each other. With The Book Thief, Markus Zusak has shown he's a writer of genius, an artist of words, a poet, a literary marvel. His writing is lyrical, haunting, poetic, profound. Death is rendered vividly, a lonely, haunted being who is drawn to children, who has had a lot of time to contemplate human nature and wonder at it. Liesel is very real, a child living a child's life of soccer in the street, stolen pleasures, sudden passions and a full heart while around her bombs drop, maimed veterans hang themselves, bereaved parents move like ghosts, Gestapo take children away and the dirty skeletons of Jews are paraded through the town.Many things save this book from being all-out depressing. It's never morbid, for a start. A lively humour dances through the pages, and the richness of the descriptions as well as the richness of the characters' hearts cannot fail to lift you up. Also, it's great to read such a balanced story, where ordinary Germans - even those who are blond and blue-eyed - are as much at risk of losing their lives, of being persecuted, as the Jews themselves.I can't go any further without talking about the writing itself. From the very first title page, you know you're in for something very special indeed. The only way to really show you what I mean is to select a few quotes (and I wish I was better at keeping track of lines I love).\"As he looked uncomfortably at the human shape before him, the young man's voice was scraped out and handed across the dark like it was all that remained of him.\" (p187) \"Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. That was the business of hiding a Jew.\" (p.239)\"The book was released gloriously from his hand. It opened and flapped, the pages rattling as it covered ground in the air. More abruptly than expected, it stopped and appeared to be sucked towards the water. It clapped when it hit the surface and began to float downstream.\" (p.325)\"So many humans. So many colours. They keep triggering inside me. They harass my memory. I see them tall in their heaps, all mounted on top of each other. There is air like plastic, a horizon like setting glue. There are skies manufactured by people, punctured and leaking, and there are soft, coal-coloured clouds, beating, like black hearts. And then. There is death. Making his way through all of it. On the surface: unflappable, unwavering. Below: unnerved, untied, and undone.\" (p.331)\"After ten minutes or so, what was most prominent in the cellar was a kind of non-movement. Their bodies were welded together and only their feet changed position or pressure. Stillness was shackled to their faces. They watched each other and waited.\" (p.402)\"People and Jews and clouds all stopped. They watched. As he stood, Max looked first at the girl and then stared directly into the sky who was wide and blue and magnificent. There were heavy beams - planks of sun - falling randomly, wonderfully, onto the road. Clouds arched their backs to look behind as they started again to move on. \"It's such a beautiful day,\" he said, and his voice was in many pieces. A great day to die. A great day to die, like this.\" (pp.543-4)Writing like this is not something just anyone can do: it's true art. Only a writer of Zusak's talent could make this story work, and coud get away with such a proliferation of adjectives and adverbs, to write in such a way as to revitalise the language and use words to paint emotion and a vivid visual landscape in a way you'd never before encountered. This is a book about the power of words and language, and it is fitting that it is written in just such this way. The way this book was written also makes me think of a musical, or an elaborate, flamboyant stage-play. It's in the title pages for each part, in Death's asides and manner of emphasing little details or even speech, in the way Death narrates, giving us the ending at the beginning, giving little melodrammatic pronouncements that make you shiver. It's probably the first book I've read that makes me feel how I feel watching The Phantom of the Opera, if that helps explain it.And it made me cry.", "num_likes": 1323, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favourite", "historical-fiction", "2008", "made-me-cry", "magical-realism", "ya", "cover-love"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/28143721", "review_id": "28143721", "date": "Jul 24, 2008", "rating": 1, "user_name": "La Petite Am\u00e9ricaine", "user_url": "/user/show/59329-la-petite-am-ricaine", "text": "UPDATE: AUG 26, 2016: This review has been here 8 years, has 18 pages of 854 comments and 764 likes.

Please save us both time and energy by not commenting. Thnx.  This was the biggest piece of garbage I've ever read after The Kite Runner. Just as with The Kite Runner, I'm (somewhat) shocked that this book is a bestseller and has been given awards, chewed up and swallowed by the literary masses and regarded as greatness. Riiiight.  The whole thing can be summed up as the story of a girl who sometimes steals books coming of age during the Holocaust. Throw in the snarky narration by Death (nifty trick except that it doesn't work), a few half-assed drawings of birdies and swastikas, senseless and often laughable prose that sounds like it was pulled from the \"poetry\" journal of a self-important 15 year-old, and a cast of characters that throughout are like watching cardboard cutouts walking around VERY SLOWLY, and that's the novel.  Here are some humble observations.  First, chances are that you, Mr. Zusak, are not Antonin Chekhov. You are, therefore, incapable of properly describing the weather for use as a literary device, and you end up sounding like an asshole. Don't believe me?\"I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate.\" Really? Do you, now? \"The sky was dripping. Like a tap that a child has tried it\u2019s hardest to turn off but hasn\u2019t quite managed.\u201d Really?? Wow. Next you'll tell me that the rain was like a shower. I'm moved. \"Oh, how the clouds stumbled in and assembled stupidly in the sky. Great obese clouds.\" Yes. Stupid, obese clouds! They need an education and a healthy diet! Next, chances are that you, Mr. Zusak, are not William Styron or any one of the other small handful of authors that can get away with Holocaust fiction. They've done their research, had some inkling of writing ability, and were able to tell fascinating stories. You invented a fake town in Germany (probably so you didn't have to do any research) and told a long-winded and poorly-written story, and in 500+ pages you couldn't even make it to 1945, so you sloppily dropped off and wrapped it up in 1943. What's the point of writing historical fiction if you can't even stay within the basic confines of that hisotrical event? For me, this does nothing more than trivialize the mass murder of over 6 million people. Maybe that's why a 30 year-old Australian shouldn't write about the Holocaust. But that's just me. Moving on.  But what really makes this book expensive toilet paper is the bad writing which is to be found not just in bizarre descriptions of the weather, but really on every page. Some personal favorites?  \"The breakfast colored sun.\"  \"Somewhere inside her were the souls of words.\"  \"The oldened young man.\" WTF?!!?  \"He crawled to a disfigured figure.\"  \"Her words were motionless.\"  \"It smelled like friendship.\" (Remind me to sniff my friends next time I see them.)\"A multitude of words and sentences were at her fingertips.\" (HUH?)  \"Pinecones littered the ground like cookies.\"  Sigh.  All of this is quite funny coming from a book where the main character supposedly learns the importance of words. Further, I love that the protagonist comes to the conclusion that Hitler \"would be nothing without words.\" Really? REALLY? Would Hitler be nothing without WORDS? What about self-loathing, misplaced blame and hatred, an ideology, xenophobia, charisma, an army, and a pride-injured nation willing to listen? Don't those count for something??  The shit-storm comes to an end when a bomb lands on our fictional town, wiping out everyone save for the sometimes book-thief main character. Of course. Because weak writers who don't know how to end their story just kill everyone off for a clean break and some nice emotional manipulation. Written for maximum tear-jerking effect, our main character spews out some great lines when she sees the death and destruction around her:  To her dead mother, \"God damn it, you were so beautiful.\"  To her dead best friend as she shakes him, \"Wake up! I love you! Wake up!\" (Didn't I see the same thing in that movie My Girl?) Then she profoundly notes that her dead father \"...was a man with silver eyes, not dead ones.\"  And this kind of angsty adolescent prose just never ended! It went on and on to form the one long-ass, senseless, disjointed story.  But that's ok. Take it all the junk, give it a quirky narrator, an obscure and mysterious title, throw in a Jew on the run from Nazis who likes to draw silly pictures of birds and swastikas, and market it all as Holocaust lit. Ahh, the packaging of bullshit makes for such a sweet best seller.  Swallow it down, America. Put it on the shelf next to The Kite Runner. You love this. You live for this.

I guess I never learned to listen to my mother. I\u2019m pretty sure her parting sentence was: \u201cDon\u2019t come crying to me.\u201d And I didn\u2019t. I huddled in a corner and cried inconsolably instead. Death himself narrates the story about a little girl named Liesel growing up with her foster parents in Nazi Germany. At the beginning, I felt somewhat intimidated by the idea of Death as a narrator. I assumed that his voice would be dark and thunderous, but for the most part, he was a ray of light illuminating earth\u2019s saddest time. Incredibly insightful observations and occasional dry humor are only some of the things no one but Death could have brought into this story. Besides, we hear people calling God\u2019s name every day for many reasons, but when Death calls to Him in despair and even those calls fall on deaf ears, no one can fail to understand the gravity of the situation.I do not carry a sickle or a scythe.I only wear a hooded black robe when it\u2019s cold.And I don\u2019t have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoypinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I truly look like?I\u2019ll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue.The Book Thief is not one of those books you read compulsively, desperate to find out what\u2019s on the next page. No. It is, in fact, better to read it slowly, in small doses, in a way that allows you to savor every word and absorb the power and the magic it contains. All the while, you know what\u2019s going to happen. Death has no patience for mysteries. However, anticipation of the inevitable makes it even worse. My whole body was tingling with fear because I knew what was coming and I knew that it was only a matter of time.Zusak found a way to give a fresh approach to a much-told story. He offered a glimpse at the other side of the coin. Really, should we feel sorry for the people hiding in a basement in Munich suburbs? Sure, bombs are falling on their heads, but most of them are members of the Nazi Party, willingly or reluctantly. Some of them truly think that Jews are no better than rats. Some, on the other hand, are hiding a Jew in their own basement. Some are just innocent children. But the more important question is, are we any better at all if we don\u2019t feel compassion and sorrow? Death does a great job of asking all these questions in a calm, unobtrusive way.I\u2019m not pretentious enough to believe that my clumsy words can ever do this book justice. I won\u2019t even try. Time will speak for it, as I\u2019m pretty sure it will survive for decades and generations to come. The Book Thief and Markus Zusak should find their place in every school textbook all over the world. Seven thousand stars could never be enough for this book.

But was it worth all that paper?Click the link for my video review of the big bois in my life.The Written Review:\n I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\nLiesel, an orphaned girl, is sent to live with a foster family right before the Nazi's take over Germany. She has a peculiar attachment to books, her first being a gravedigger's manual that she picks up during her brother's funeral. Death takes an interest in her and her books on that day and follows her, sometimes constantly and sometimes at a distance. There's just something so...fascinating...about her that Death cannot stay away.Meanwhile Liesel slowly grows up in the heart of Nazi Germany. Her adoptive Papa and Mama make her bleak life bearable. But Rudy, her best friend, makes everything right in this world.\nA snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship.\n But their idyllic lives cannot stay that way forever. Food shortages are rampart, money becomes ever tighter and Papa's son believes every word from Hitler. And throughout all of this, Death watches.... and waits. \nEven death has a heart.\nWhew. I have avoided this one for so long...and I'm so glad that I finally took the plunge.Normally, I dislike most books/movies/games set in Nazi Germany.I absolutely hate anything that turns that much pain and sorrow into a gimmick to sell more of the product. I feel that a majority of that entertainment field both cheapens the experience and is hugely disrespectful to the victims. I feel like this subject should be treated delicately - and there are very few bits of media that I feel do it justice.The Book Thief was just absolutely perfect in that sense. This book was just the right mixture of joys and sorrows, of highs and lows, and of good and evil.I loved Liesel and the way she grew up against the ever-present tide of Nazis. The way she and her family struggled against the world, by hiding a Jew or showing sympathy, really made this book shine.Death made an interesting perspective, though I wish the book would have been narrated more from inside his head. Overall, loved this one. Though (and this may be just me), but am I the only one disappointed by the title?I really was expecting a bit more book-thievery...instead Liesel was (mostly) given the very few books that she \"steals\".

Here are my three reasons for doing so:1) It's a Young Adult Book. I am an Adult. It can't be that good if it's written for young people.2) It's about the Holocaust, and I think we've all heard enough about that. The author will probably even focus on colors among the grays, as in \"Schindler's List.\"3) I have WAY too many other books to read.After avoiding the book for as long as possible, I sat down, hoping to enjoy it enough to gain some clever comments for the book group.Turns out, most of my concerns were right. But one other thing was also true: THIS BOOK ROCKS.The first thing any review will say about this book is that it is narrated by death. So, I might as well get it out of the way. Death, the Hooded One, the Angel of the Night, narrates. He is very busy during the war years, as you might expect. Some people claim this is a mere gimmick, and that the story is strong enough as it is. I agree that this is a strong story-- it moves like a sailboat on a brisk day-- but I think the choice to tell it through Death was a good one. Death foreshadows constantly, so we know a bit about which of the characters will die. Instead of ruining the shock value, this heightened my anticipation and dread. And isn't that how people feel during war? They know some of them are bound to die. They know they will lose loved ones. It's one long, hellish wait to see how it will turn out. It's also an unusual take on the Holocaust because it focuses on Liesel, an orphaned German girl living in Hitler's birthplace. Liesel (The Book Thief) and the other characters in this book are rich, interesting, and wily. I say wily because at points in the book you hate them, but they change, and you grow to love them. For instance, Liesel's adopted mother is a foul-mouthed, abusive, sharp woman. (SPOILER--->) When Liesel's adopted father is shipped off to war, however, Liesel creeps through the house to see Rosa sleeping with her husband's accordian strapped around her waist. Rosa's changes prove one of the greatest reasons to read good literature-- to get insight into the type of people we don't usually give a second chance.

The book felt almost episodic in nature. These stories are supposed to come together and form a novel that is all kinds of awesome, but it was so bland.

This story is narrated by Death during World War II, and it is the story of a young German girl who comes of age during one of the most horrific times in recent history. Death has a personality. If something bad is about to happen, Death warns you ahead of time. My favorite part is when \"he\" stomps on a framed picture of Hitler on his way to retrieve a thousand souls from a bomb raid. Death is trying to understand the human race as much as the humans are. When \"his\" job becomes unbearable, he watches the color of the sky as he gathers the souls and carries them away.

I was really excited to read this after all of the glowing reviews it got, but I was left extremely disappointed. I found the writing stilted and stuttering (hard to stutter in writing, but this book pulls it off), overly sentimental, and heavy-handed on the symbolism.I also found the author's approach to the story to be just plain gimmicky. The first and foremost gimmick (also see heavyy-handed symbolism) is that the story is narrated by Death. Now, this might work in some books, but not this one. The choice of narrator adds absolutely nothing to the story; it is only a distraction to the reader, and it also encouraged the author to add trite observations about Death's perspective (for example, he doesn't carry a scythe, but likes the human image) that add nothing to the story. If Death here had been given developed personality or a unique perspective, then maybe (and even then it's a stretch) the choice of narrator would have worked. As it is, the story is told almost entirely as though by an omniscient narrator (is Death omniscient?) and we get absolutely nothing from the choice of Death to fill the role. It's a gimmick, and it falls flat.The other gimmick I found most distracting (these are not the only two, but they are the most egregious) is the repeated use of little newsflash-type, bold and centered notes that appear periodically through the story to highlight some stupid point and add (in the author's mind) dramatic effect. These newsflashes, as I think of them, were irritating and served only to break up the natural narrative flow without adding anything significant. This is another example of the author hitting the reader over the head with his points, rather than trusting his own writing to get the message across. This is another ill-conceived and heavy-handed gimmick intended to correct for a poor narrative.I think it is telling that while this book gets listed as teen fiction, Zusak actually wrote it for adults. For some reason, it got identified as being for teens when it got marketed in the U.S. (it was written in Australia). It seems to me that the explanation for this change is that the novel feels like it was written by a very immature author, and so the prose does not attain the quality one should expect of adult fiction.I think good Holocaust stories need to be told, but the Book Thief fails at that endeavor. The story is trite; the narrative is sentimental and uninspired. I recommend that you look elsewhere for something better. If you want something for younger readers, try Number the Stars, by Lois Lowry. If you're a bit older, also read Night by Elie Weisel or the Diary of Anne Frank. I might even add in Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, to counteract the heavy-handed book-burning theme of the Book Thief.

My wife was shedding copious tears as she finished reading the book, and insisted that I read it immediately. How could I not? I was prepared for a moving read and was not disappointed. Sophie N\u00e9lisse as Liesel Meminger - from TV Guide The main character is Liesel Meminger, just shy of ten years old when we first meet her. It is pre-WW II Germany. Her father has been transported for being a \u201cKommunist.\u201d While en route with her mother and brother, Werner, to be handed over to foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her brother dies. At his burial, she retrieves a book dropped by one of the gravediggers, a connection to her brother, and begins her career as a book thief. The Hubermanns live on Himmell (heaven) Street in the town of Molching, outside Munich. Rosa is a coarse, foul-mouthed woman. Hans is a warm, supportive papa. They come to form a very devoted, loving family. The story follows Liesel\u2019s coming of age, meeting other children, particularly her bff Rudy, making friends, seeing reflected in the actions of her peers and the events that occur in the town the horrors of the age. But there is much more to this portrait of a German town than the bullies one expects to grow into the expected abusive stereotypes. There is hope, as well, for those who are dragged into the military against their wishes, for those who harbor fugitive Jews at great personal risk, for those who stand up against the abuse of the weak, for those who share a love of knowledge with those eager to learn. There is sadness, as some cannot live with what they have seen, what they have lost. Nico Liersch as Rudy Steiner - from Imglist.comThe Book Thief is populated with a klatch of wonderful characters. The spirited Liesel will win your heart, as will her friend Rudy, Hans and even Rosa. There are other characters who will also pluck those strings. You will be rooting for this one or that one, cheering victories and weeping at defeats. Having characters one comes to care for is the greatest strength of this book.Over all is an appreciation for words, their power for both good and evil, the magic of language, books as a source of both damnation and salvation. Liesel steals her first book as a way of maintaining a connection with her dead brother. Later, learning to read and continuing to steal books gives her a feeling of power. The impact of Mein Kampf receives much attention as does book burning.Geoffrey Rush as Hans Hubermann - from Aceshowbiz.comZusak uses an unlikely narrator for his tale, Death, who speaks to us as a reporter, an observer of events, not as someone who causes death, but as one who gently carries off the souls of those who have passed. While I have no problem with this device, and while I was charmed by the characterization, I was not convinced that it was entirely necessary. One could have just used a more usual third-party narrative to tell the tale. But it is a fun addition nonetheless. The film retained the narrator and did, IMHO, a pretty good job of capturing the essence of the book.Emily Watson as Rossa Hubermann - from Hypable.comZusak takes a lot of stylistic chances here, from his selection of a narrator to the incorporation of a few illustrated tales within the larger whole. They did not all work, but most did, and I appreciated his willingness to draw outside the lines. Mark ZusakThe Book Thief accomplishes a very lofty goal.

This book takes such an interesting perspective on a very written about period of history. Having Death as the narrator for parts of the story really took it to the next level; it made it utterly unique. It also created a sense of detachment from the events, and evoked the message that death is unavoidable and will eventually come for all. I loved it, and I think the heroine is just superb. A book thieving heroine? Say no more!    For me, one of the most important aspects of a well written character is someone I can sympathise with and feel vast quantities of empathy for. So, when the protagonist is in love with reading and appreciates the freedom it can grant, I find myself somewhat immediately won over to her cause. Liesel\u2019s story is woe begotten and tragic yet she always seems to carry on; she always seems to realise that there are good things in this world. And they\u2019re not just books; they\u2019re people too. She doesn\u2019t give up and fall into a pit of self-pity. You\u2019ve got to hand it to her for that. For a young girl she is incredibly strong. She\u2019s written so well; it\u2019s so easy to invest in her story and wish for her to have an ending she deserves. But, death, by its very nature, doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cA small fact:You are going to die....does this worry you?\u201d Indeed, Death is cold and undiscriminating; he can come at any time and take anyone. I should have known this was going to be a sad one. Death pretty much said so from the start. But one can hope: one can hope that someone who has gone through so much will get a happy ending, though that\u2019s not the point of this book. I\u2019m saddened by the ending, but it was necessary. This book\u2019s impact would have been marginally lessened if the deaths didn\u2019t happen at the end. At least Liesel found some degree of comfort, which lifted the veil of misery somewhat. The ending of this book is precisely what made it so powerful. I wouldn\u2019t want it\u2019s sadness any other way.  A fantastic story Liesel is an orphan, and when she was adopted I expected her to have an absolutely terrible time. I expected her adopted parents to be awful. This just seemed like the predictable route this story would take, and I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t go that way because Liesel learnt the value of human kindness. In the Hubermann household she received warmth and comfort. Hans Hubermann is an excellent man; he is open-hearted and genuine in his affection. He is everything the young orphan needed in a parent, and he is everything that was needed to balance the darkness in the book. He is a true figure of strength and someone who represents the underappreciated resistance to Nazism within Germany during WW2. He refuses to become a member of the political party and even hides a Jew in his basement. He\u2019s a good man, a great man. He is Liesel\u2019s rock and figure of morale guidance. He\u2019s a great character. I know I keep saying that but it is so true. Everything about this book is just brilliant. I think this is such an accomplished story. It takes a lot to write a book like this, and to end it like this. The temptation to end it differently must have been humongous. It\u2019s refreshing to see a modern story actually end how it should rather than the easier route of a happy ending. This certainly won\u2019t be the last book I\u2019ll be reading by Marcus Zusak.

He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers... She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on.\" (hide spoiler)]\"He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It\u2019s his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry.\"Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who possessed so much integrity and courage, who became real parents to Liesel, who risked everything for what they thought was right. Max Vandenburg, the Jewish fistfighter, who dreamed of battling Hitler and gave Liesel the perfect gift with everything he had.\"[...] Papa, you saved me. You taught me to read. No one can play like you. I'll never drink champagne. No one can play like you.\"\"Make no mistake, the woman had a heart. She had a bigger one that people would think. There was a lot in it, stored up, high in miles of hidden shelving. Remember that she was the woman with the instrument strapped to her body in the long, moon-slit night.\"\"And Liesel herself, lost and broken, but finding comfort and strength in family, friends, and books. Liesel, who learns more about the cold cruelty of this world than most children should ever know. Liesel, who learns to read from the Gravedigger's handbook, who rescues the book from fire, who would rather steal books than food, who is not afraid to show kindness in the face of very real threat, who finally gives Rudy that overdue kiss, who fascinates even Death itself. All of them remained human despite the circumstances, despite the pressure to do otherwise, despite anything. And I love them for that.This is a wonderful, lyrical, surreal, excellent book that broke my heart into tiny little pieces and yet gave me hope that even in the worst of times we can find beauty. 5 stars is not enough, but this is all I can give. \"I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\"-----------------DISCLAIMER: This is the first review that I've wrote after working four 14-hour days in a row followed by endless reading of textbooks and paperwork, all sore from endless and painful retracting in surgery, having composed this review in my head as a means to not pass out from hunger in the endless surgery.

I will tell you a story.\"\nI should stop fooling myself thinking that there's ever getting better at bracing through these WWII stories... or any war stories for that matter, whether they are based on real events or completely fictional. But then, they are some of the most important books anyone can ever read, capable change one's whole belief systems and priorities in life while improving the reader's ability to empathize tremendously. For me, The Book Thief turned out to be one such exceptional story.\n\"Like most misery, it started with apparent happiness.\"\nWhen it comes to enjoying a story, different readers obviously look for different things from plot to style of writing, complex/ interesting characters, world building, the flow, and many more. What's strange about The Book Thief is, while it has nothing special going on in terms of aforementioned characteristics (may be with the exception of the beautiful writing), the book affects the reader in a most profound way. I believe it's because of the undistorted nature of the underlying story, leading up to a heartbreaking, yet perfectly realistic ending. When you realize the events are not further from the truth, it's quite easy to become overwhelmed with emotions here. But I believe that's the whole point of a story like this.\n\"The human child - so much cannier at times than the stupefying ponderous adult.\"\n\n\"A DEFINITION NOT FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY - Not leaving: an act of trust and love, often deciphered by children.\"\nBut that doesn't mean the story is lacking in anyway when it comes to characters or storytelling. Though Zusak is not attempting to go out of the way to create and outstanding main character, the realistic development of Liesel Meminger is absolutely beautiful; it's hard not to fall in love with her. The secondary characters are equally wonderful, though that ending makes it all the more difficult to brace against, having being acquainted with them that well. \n\"Presents#1-#13: A smashed ball. One ribbon. One pinecone. One button. One stone. One feather. Two newspapers. A candy wrapper. A cloud. One toy soldier. One miraculous leaf. A finished whistler. A slab of grief.\"\nOne thing I might not be in the majority here is the narrator, the Death. I didn't hate it by any means, but for me, it didn't seem completely necessary to use such point of view, though I understand the author's intention to introduce a unique perspective. But on the plus side, the reader do get some advance warnings about certain disappointment down the line. It was a little strange at times, coming across those 'spoiler' type warnings, like the ones related to Rudy. At first, I had assumed may be it was the author being considerate, allowing the readers to brace themselves. But the actual ending came with an unbelievable shock, making the warnings about Rudy - though still quite painful - becoming only a fraction of the disappointment. It was an unforgiving , yet very realistic ending.\n\"If I beat you, I get to kiss you.\"\nThis is the kind of book, which makes one feel like there's not enough stars to do justice. Like I said before, for me, it's not about literary devices when it comes to a book like this. It's all about authentic nature of the story, and the ability to affect the reader in a profound way. The satisfies both of these things perfectly. The Book Thief easily made it to my all-time-favorites and I believe this should be read by everyone. As far as the emotions go, this not an easy read, especially towards the end, but it's worth the effort.\n\n'That's my papa's accordion.' Again.

I no longer have it. I did not even finish reading it, because it irritated me so much and when I asked if it got better no one could convince me that it was worth persevering. I know that there are many people who love this book, authors who's book I love, readers who's tastes I respect. But I couldn't stand the narrator. Every time the Narrator intruded on the story it felt like exactly that--an intrusion. A lot of people really like the narrator, and I imagine if you did the book would be much more enjoyable to read. As it was I found the writing style consciously \"artistic\" or \"literary\" while the characters felt fake, superficial, and mechanical. I was too aware of the mechanics of the story and how he was manipulating the reader--kind of like going to a puppet show and having the puppeteer continually slipping and letting himself be seen. It kept knocking me out of the story.Holocaust fiction is hard for me to read anyway, because it's an incredibly difficult period of history and human experience to read about. For me to want to read Holocaust fiction, it had better be better than okay, or even good--ti had better be absolutely amazing for me to be willing to put myself through the emotional pain and struggles that are inherent with a holocaust book. Real life is hard enough for me to get upset and stressed out by a mediocre book.And please don't take that to mean that I only read books that are light and fluffy and safe, because I do read books that are hard, that are sad. But while some people same to take pleasure in reading a book just because it is sad (\"Oh, this is a wonderful book! It made me cry!\"), I don't enjoy crying in and of itself. For me to read a book that is heart wrenching, it had better offer me something besides an emotional train wreck--powerful characters I really care about, an engrossing story line, some new observation on human existence and human relations,  something. I do not usually read fiction to \"learn,\" per se--that is, if I wanted to learn more about the Holocaust, I'd read non-fiction accounts. I have read non-fiction accounts. I have read a few things of Holocaust fiction as well, and I have read some scholarly work as well. So it doesn't sell me on the book that it is a painful story, that it shows that some Germans were good and how social pressures created the Holocaust. I needed it to be a book about people that really interested me, that I cared about, and instead I was bored with the characters and irritated at the narrator and the obvious manipulations of the author. Instead of getting wrapped into the story, every night I when I was reading it I'd throw it down and vent for a half an hour to my husband about something that annoyed me. After a few nights of this, I realized that unless someone could convince me that the second half of the book was much better than the first that it just wasn't worth my time to finish.'m not saying it's a bad book.

CheckStrong emotions? Check.Resolute characters? Check.Compelling narration? Double check. The writing engrossed me. The concept of death narrating the story was eloquently put forward. Often, when you have very high expectations from a book, you may end up getting disappointed. But this book proved to be quite the opposite and I loved it immensely.The story follows a nine-year-old girl called Liesel Meminger who along with her brother Werner, given up by her mother, is taken to a small town called Molching to live with Hans and Rosa Hubermann prior to the events of World War II. During the journey, Werner dies due to mysterious reasons, possibly poverty and poor health and Liesel sets off to bury him. That is when she steals her first book, even though she does not know how to read and it's only the first of what is going to be a series of thefts. She gets accustomed to her foster parents' house despite having nightmares about her dead brother, and eventually learns to read. Her obsession with books intensifies as war closes in and air raids begin- depriving her of people she's grown to love profoundly.The book exemplifies the power of words, how they can be beautiful yet exceedingly soul shattering. Liesel is illiterate when she was first taken in, but as she continues to explore the world of reading, she begins to comprehend the impact Hitler's propaganda has and how he is the reason behind her parents' death.   \"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\"   She realises how manipulative words can be and tries to right them by writing for commiseration.Overall, The Book Thief is a poignant and a heart rending tale and it's a surprise I'm still lucid.

This book just wasn't my cuppa, and that's OK. We're allowed to like different books.My ListI think the thing I hated the most was the writing itself. The sentences were rough, uneven and felt unfinished. I hated that even though the sentences and chapters were short and choppy, the book was 550 pages long! Two hundred pages could have been cut from this sucker, easily.I hated how Zusak wrote the narrator Death, and how Death was constantly foreshadowing things. Dude, I get it, you're omniscient. I hated that Zusak chose to put his cliched story about a girl who likes books against the backdrop of the Holocaust. It seemed like the author was milking a tragedy to try and make his book seem deeper than it is.I hated that every scene was precious, oh so schmaltzy and precious! I hated that the characters were all two-dimensional and none of them seemed real. They were just a collection of anecdotes.I hated that the entire book felt like a pretentious writing exercise by some smarmy grad student.This is the second YA novel that I've hated this year, and I'm taking a break from the genre.

Published in 2005, The Book Thief became an international bestseller and was translated into several languages. It was adapted into a 2013 feature film of the same name.Narrated by Death, a male voice who over the course of the book proves to be morose yet caring, the plot follows Liesel Meminger as she comes of age in Nazi Germany during World War II. After the death of her younger brother on a train to the fictional town of Molching, Germany, on the outskirts of Munich, Liesel arrives at the home of her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, distraught and withdrawn. During her time there, she is exposed to the horrors of the Nazi regime, caught between the innocence of childhood and the maturity demanded by her destructive surroundings. As the political situation in Germany deteriorates, her foster parents conceal a Jewish fist-fighter named Max Vandenburg. Hans, who has developed a close relationship with Liesel, teaches her to read, first in her bedroom, then in the basement. Recognizing the power of writing and sharing the written word, Liesel not only begins to steal books that the Nazi party is looking to destroy, but also writes her own story, and shares the power of language with Max. Through collecting laundry for her foster mother, she also begins a relationship with the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, who allows her to first read books in her library, and later, steal them.

review under severe duress.Three-star books are always difficult to review, aren\u2019t they? They are difficult for me, mostly because I am so dispassionate about them. It\u2019s much easier to review something you love, or something you hate, rather than something you\u2019ve half-forgotten before you even get to your local library\u2019s return box.So this book is fine. Fine. It\u2019s the story of a young German girl caught in the path of the advancing Nazi regime during World War II. For many German villagers in the late 30s and early 40s, the Third Reich was like a quiet glacier, slowly encroaching on their lives\u2014it moved languidly enough that disaster seemed never truly imminent (there is always plenty of time to get out of the way), yet it had enough momentum to churn to pulp anything that was unfortunate enough to meet its frothing jaws.What annoyed me about this book, however, was its distracting style of storytelling. It is told from the point-of-view of the Grim Reaper, the personification of death. I would have actually been okay with this except Death is a grating little sonofabitch. He pretends to keep a distance from the German girl whose story he\u2019s telling, representing himself as a disinterested party whose job is simply to harvest souls from their lifeless hosts, but over time he becomes clearly vested in her story, and for this he is a failure. I mean, if death and taxes are the only two things I can count on, and the IRS is a bullshit government arm that can\u2019t find its asshole with a flashlight, then I need to be able to depend on Death not being a loser.Additionally, I specifically detested the\n* * * Things That Irritate Me * * *1.

In the Book Thief, Zusak uses a rich, multi-layered blend of allegory, metaphor and symbolism to create amidst the dirt and depression of Germany during the late 30s and 40s a stark vision of historical and philosophical thoughtfulness. This international best seller features a healthy sense of dramatic irony, with the German setting and the strong use of script-like construction becoming reminiscent, vaguely, of Bertold Brecht, especially the sympathetic depiction of Marxists. By using a surreal personification as a narrator, the author has softened the blow of the harsh setting and thus, incredibly, makes the characters more accessible and makes the reader approach an empathy with them that may otherwise be unavailable. I am reminded of Anthony Burgess\u2019 comments about A Clockwork Orange and how he created the Nadsat language not just to add depth to his narration, but also to minimize the brutality of his story. In much the same way, Zusak has used Death as a narrator to ironically assuage the viciousness of the everyday life that Liesel and the Hubermanns experience in their quiet section of Nazi extremism.Death is not just a narrator but also one of the characters. Telling a story from his vantage, about a group of Germans on Himmel (Heaven) Street amidst the moral flagellation of the Third Reich Zusak creates a fecundity of symbolic structure. I found myself getting lost in metaphoric possibilities. What did he mean by that? What could that symbolize? Yet the author does not over generalize or make universal declarations, his approach is far more subtle, and again Brechtian in it\u2019s demystification for dramatic realism; the reader comes to know Liesel Meminger, not as an ultra-real snapshot, nor as a idealized German everygirl, but as an actress in a play, knowable and probable, but still a dramatic portrayal. Through the eyes of Death, Liesel enters from stage left and we follow her through stereotypical misadventures made hackneyed in the World War II genre, but also through the good, the bad, and the ugly that is histrionic enough to be believable and understandable as an expression of real life during Nazi Germany. This is still, though, after all, a representative portrayal of an ugly time. The reader should not look for a Disney moment, there are few. Zusak peppers his chronicle with some scenes of comic relief, but he never lets you forget when and where the action takes place. Expectations of Hollywood commercial breaks will come and go unnoticed on this trip; and all to the credit of its creator, who has crafted that most rare of accomplishments: a commercial success and at the same time an artistic expression.A very singular literary experience and an enjoyable journey with a young writer from whom we have much to expect.", "num_likes": 270, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/18125042", "review_id": "18125042", "date": "Mar 19, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Walt", "user_url": "/user/show/1005462-walt", "text": "Bravo Zusak! A standing ovation, a mighty opus. You stood Death on her head, removing her dark cloak and scythe, clothing her with feeling and letting us see she has eyes to see and a heart to feel, and the intellect to narrate a compelling story. I was so glad to find out she has a womb. Out of Death comes Life. She has greater aplomb than Nick in telling about Gatsby.In the spring of 1968 at age 19, I made my way to Dachau. I lived just south of Munich and the visit to the defunct concentration camp had a haunting effect upon me that will last until Death comes for me and, I believe, beyond (but eternity\u2019s yet another subject; this story was about life.) I went back to Dachau several times, the souls of the living and the dead calling me. As I worked among Germans in nearby Munich, I was surprised to encounter Jews still, or perhaps again, making their home there, so close to Dachau, so soon after Hitler and his henchmen. These early experiences furnished my life with both angst and vision: with angst to recognize the potential for evil within ever human being and with vision to see the possibility for courage and compassion, to pick up a piece of bread to feed a cipher.And that\u2019s a big part of what The Book Thief does for me: it captures and again reminds me of these viabilities as they play out near Dachau in the heart of World War II\u2019s Nazi Germany in the lives of Liesel and her contemporaries, alive and dead. Death tells Liesel\u2019s tragic yet wonderful story in order to keep memory alive. In the words of Elie Wiesel, \u201cBecause if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.\u201d And surely this is Liesel\u2019s story not Death\u2019s just as Gatsby's isn\u2019t Nick\u2019s. To remind us to stand up wherever tyranny and power put people down.Zusak took the time and effort to invest the narrative with near perfect words and wonderful sentences and great paragraphs and superb chapters. It would have been too cruel and ironic if the \u201cbook thief\u201d had found herself betrayed by the words, sentences, and paragraphs of her story\u2019s teller. Flesh fully clothes each character; conflict, action, and suspense oblige the attention of each reader; and the themes are true and consistent throughout, start to finish, and the setting is hauntingly perfect. I hope because of this book I am closer to bending over and picking up some bread to give to a cipher, even if it puts us both at Death\u2019s door.It is a mighty work.", "num_likes": 267, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["young-adult"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/31225324", "review_id": "31225324", "date": "Aug 26, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Brigid \u2729", "user_url": "/user/show/886144-brigid", "text": "Oh, Book Thief \u2026I first picked up this book when I was 15 years old, after I'd been hearing such glowing reviews of it here on Goodreads. I knew next to nothing about it, besides that everyone seemed to love it so much; I recall seeing a conversation where a bunch of people agreed it was the best Young Adult book ever written. And then I pick it up from the library and it has some review on the front from the New York Times or something claiming this book is \"LIFE-CHANGING\" or something like that. So I'm like, \"\u2026 Damn. Is it really that good?\"That first time I read it, it took me only about two or three days. I devoured it, unable to put it down. And when I came to the ending, all I could do was sit there for like half an hour staring at a wall, because I just felt totally numb afterward. I felt utterly shell-shocked. It was just like:I had never read anything quite like it. It amazed me.Unfortunately, at the time I was really crappy at writing reviews, and all I wrote was like, \"OMG THIS BOOK IS AMAZING AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT. IT'S JUST SO GOOOOD. LIKE TOTALLY.\"And well, I still agree with that statement. But now, I'm going to attempt to say it in a more thought-out and coherent manner. It had been about five years since I read the book for the first time, and I figured it would be a good idea to read it again. I still remembered it all pretty clearly, and I still considered it one of my all-time favorite books even though I'd only read it once. But I still really wanted to experience reading it again.I'm very glad I got around to reading it a second time. This time, I read it much more slowly\u2013\u2013and even though I definitely appreciated it the first time, I think I appreciated it even more the second time. First of all, the writing in this book is just beautiful. I \u2026 just \u2026 Markus Zusak. I can't even. \u201cPeople observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and ends, but to me it's quite clear that a day merges through a multitude of shades and intonations with each passing moment. A single hour can consist of thousands of different colors. Waxy yellows, cloud-spot blues. Murky darkness. In my line of work, I make it a point to notice them.\u201dHow \u2026 HOW. TEACH ME YOUR WAYS. UGH MARKUS ZUSAK.MARKUS.ZUSAK.Hahahaha look upon my beautiful face as I read from this book that will destroy your soul!Fun fact: if you search for images of Markus Zusak, one of the searches Google suggests is \"Markus Zusak shirtless\" (also \"Markus Zusak muscles\"). There aren't really any results for either one. Not that I checked.So yeah, the point is that I love Markus Zusak so much that I hate his guts. And it doesn't help that he's also so attractive. Damn it.Okay, okay. The jokes aside \u2026 I love the way this book is written. The choice to have it narrated by Death is quite an interesting one. The first time I read the book, it was a bit confusing to me at first, and it's the type of choice that could have become very gimmicky. Zusak made quite a risky decision there, but ultimately I think it was a great decision. Death's narration somehow manages to be not too overpowering; after all, most of the story is focused on Liesel. But it also is an important factor of the narration that doesn't get forgotten. And then there are the characters \u2026 THE CHARACTERS.Can I just get them all together and hug them all?Damn it, I'd even hug Death. I'd hug the shit out of them all.Liesel is such a wonderful and relatable main character. She's by no means a perfect person, which makes her seem like a real young girl. Her love of words is just so tangible and powerful. I think a lot of avid readers can see themselves in her\u2013\u2013a girl who would do anything for stories. She's so passionate and smart and sweet and just \u2026 ugh. I love her. I don't see how you could read this book and not fall in love with her.Speaking of falling in love \u2026 Max. Oh my goodness, Max. I just want to marry that guy. He's so wonderful and such a sweetheart and just \u2026 aggh.The friendship between Liesel and Max is so beautifully done, and something that's pretty atypical for a YA book (or for any book, I guess) \u2026 I mean, there's like a 10+ year age difference between them or something, and it could have come off as super creepy, but it isn't at all. It's wonderful. (view spoiler)[The little books Max makes for Liesel \u2026 GGGAAHH. Also the scene where she sees him getting marched through the streets, and she runs out to him \u2026 OH MY GODDDD. And at the very end where they're like the only people left alive, and they meet each other years later and they just hug each other and cry \u2026 Arrrgh, my heart. (hide spoiler)]Oh, and of course there's Rudy. AAAAAHHHhhhh Rudy. He's so freaking adorable and awesome. And \u2026 I don't even know what else I can say. Words can't describe my love for that kid.(view spoiler)[His death at the end is pretty much the saddest thing in history. I can't think about it without almost crying. I just can't handle it. And you know, about halfway through the book, Death actually tells the reader that Rudy is going to die at the end \u2026 and it's still absolutely heartbreaking when it happens. AGH. (hide spoiler)]And Hans! Hans Hubermann! Hans with his accordion and his wonderfulness. He's like my favorite literary dad ever (besides maybe Atticus Finch). The relationship between Hans and Liesel is so adorable. Ahhh \u2026 I have no words. A TYPICAL HANS HUBERMANN ARTWORK:[Insert silly illustration of a stick-figure girl with a huge smile and no eyes.]Liesel: Papa! I have no eyes!Hans: With a smile like that, you don't need eyes.(view spoiler)[You know, I can't decide what makes me sadder \u2026 Rudy dying or Hans dying. Well, who am I kidding. They're both equally sad. (hide spoiler)]Okay, I could continue listing every single character in the book and talking about how wonderful they are, and how the characterization of every single one of them is so amazing and wonderful, so that you feel like you live in the same neighborhood as all of them, and yada yada \u2026 but I'll just stop there. Basically, the characters in this book are just phenomenal. Over all, the book just has such a powerful message about how storytelling is what helps us cope with the worst of times\u2013\u2013and obviously, the Holocaust was one of the most terrifying periods of history. Although I have certainly never experienced something so traumatic, the book still strikes a personal chord with me\u2013\u2013just because it really conveys how books and words are so powerful, and how they can save people's lives. (view spoiler)[I mean, Liesel's life is literally saved because of words at the end, since she's writing in the basement when the bombings happen. It's just \u2026 UGGGH. (hide spoiler)] So \u2026 I don't know what else there is to say. After reading this a second time, I can still say that this is one of my favorite books ever. It's just stunning and astounding and beautiful, and I don't even know how to express my adoration of it. As an aspiring YA author, I can only hope that someday I'll be able to write a YA book this amazing. And I can't thank Markus Zusak enough for writing it. One little side note:There's a movie coming out next year! And I'm super excited. I haven't heard much news about it, but Liesel has been cast. She will be played by a young French actress named Sophie N\u00e9lisse \u2026 who I think has only been in one other (French) movie, so I guess at this point it's difficult to judge her acting ability. However, I think I'm already in love with her, because JUST LOOK HOW CUTE SHE IS. AWWW.\u2026 Okay, that's all.(Update: Yaaaay the trailer came out!

It's the story of Liesel's childhood, the thief of books, a little girl adopted by a modest German family, dealing with hunger and bombs. It's the story of his adoptive dad and mom, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, a good and gentle man, the first, a crusty and practical big lady, the second. It's the story of Rudy Steiner, a Liesel's playmate, who falls in love with her. And it's the story of Max, a jewish boy, who weaves his own destiny with that of Liesel. Although some statements appear to be somewhat cryptic, Zusak's prose is fluid and meaningful.\u00abFor some reason, the dying guys always ask questions they already know about the answer. Maybe because they can die knowing they are right\u00bb\"the Death\" tells us, an entity weighing on the Earth, the souls just gathered in the fingers. The novel is narrated precisely from the point of view of the Death, which is having its job during World War II, forced into working extra hours by a conflict that causes victims relentlessly.In this book I see influences of Stephen King's \"The Body\" and \"It\", because of the way of Liesel and Rudy live their friendship. I see the influence of Neil Gaiman's \"Death\", because of the eccentric character of the Death. But above all, this book is son of Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". I cannot fail to see the little Scout in Liesel's shoes, as well as I cannot fail to see the good Atticus in Hans Hubermann's shoes. I cannot fail to see the same oppressed, black persons in jews's shoes.Vote: 7,5Prologo: forse non ho prestato la dovuta attenzione, in ogni caso non ho capito niente del prologo (o quasi). L'inizio non \u00e8 stato dei pi\u00f9 entusiasmanti, le prime pagine mi hanno lasciato abbastanza indifferente. Solamente le prime pagine, per\u00f2. Primo capitolo: il romanzo si riprende subito, cattura il mio interesse. Fino alla fine.Siamo in Germania, durante la seconda guerra mondiale. E' la storia della fanciullezza di Liesel, la ladra di libri, una bambina adottata da una modesta famiglia tedesca, alle prese con la fame e le bombe. E' la storia del suo pap\u00e0 e della sua mamma adottivi, Hans e Rosa Hubermann, un uomo buono e mite il primo, un donnone burbero e pratico la seconda. E' la storia di Rudy Steiner, compagno di giochi di Liesel, dichiaratamente innamorato di lei. Ed \u00e8 la storia di Max, un ragazzo ebreo che intreccia il proprio destino con quello di Liesel. Nonostante alcune affermazioni risultino essere un p\u00f2 criptiche, la prosa di Zusak \u00e8 scorrevole.\u00abPer qualche ragione, i moribondi fanno sempre domande di cui conoscono gi\u00e0 la risposta. Forse perch\u00e9 cos\u00ec possono morire avendo ragione\u00bbci dice \"la Morte\", un'entit\u00e0 che vaga sulla terra, le anime appena raccolte tra le dita. Non credo di spoilerare nulla (lo si capisce fin dal prologo) se dico che il libro \u00e8 narrato proprio dal punto di vista della Morte, che ha il suo bel daffare durante la seconda guerra mondiale, costretta agli straordinari da un conflitto che miete vittime senza sosta.In questo romanzo vedo influenze de \"Il corpo\" (\"The Body\") e di \"It\" di Stephen King, per come Liesel e Rudy vivono la loro amicizia. Vedo influenze del \"Death\" di Neil Gaiman, per il carattere piuttosto eccentrico della Morte. Ma soprattutto questo libro \u00e8 figlio de \"Il buio oltre la siepe\" di Harper Lee. Non riesco a non rivedere la piccola Scout nei panni di Liesel, come pure non riesco a non rivedere il buon Atticus nei panni di Hans Hubermann. Non riesco a non rivedere gli stessi oppressi, persone di colore nei panni degli ebrei.Voto 7,5", "num_likes": 257, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/252927921", "review_id": "252927921", "date": "Dec 29, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Debra ", "user_url": "/user/show/5032725-debra", "text": "This is my all time favorite book!

Liesel learns to read with the help of her accordion playing foster father. She develops a love of books and cannot help stealing them when the opportunity presents itself.

Finally, I decided to give it a go. Although it isn't my usual type of book, I found it to be a beautiful story.'The Book Thief' tells the story of a young girl, Liesel, growing up in Germany during WWII. After the death of her brother, she is put into foster care by her mother. Unlikely as it may seem, she goes on to form a close relationship with her foster father as she grows up in a nation inundated by the Nazi regime.Along the way, Liesel forms a friendship with a neighborhood boy, Rudy Steiner. She falls in love with books and takes to stealing during that trying time. In so many ways, her childhood mirrored any other \"normal\" happy childhood. However, the over-bearing presence of Hitler's Nazi influence loomed in the background. The fear and lack of control felt by Liesel and her community was palpable.When her foster parents choose to hide a Jewish man, Max Vandenburg, in their basement, Liesel's story becomes even more complicated. There is no denying the brutal reality of life under the Nazi regime. I held my breath, waiting for their secret to be discovered.While some parts of the story were predictable, given that we all know how WWII ended, other elements of this story surprised me. I had put off reading this story for quite some time because I expected it to be rather bleak. While there were some depressing, gloomy topics that were addressed, I was glad to find that the book did not take on that vibe entirely. Mostly, I found the story to be enlightening and inspirational.Overall, this was a fabulous book. I can see it becoming a standard \"required reading\" book for school-aged children.

This seems to be the case with Markus Zusak's 2005 novel, The Book Thief. I first read it on a recommendation from a librarian friend, and now find myself talking about it at great length to anyone who will listen (if you listen closely, you can hear my students start to groan...until they start reading it, that is). With any luck, I'll get it on my reading list at the school I teach at by next year. It's that kind of good.The novel centers around the experiences of a young girl in World War II-era Germany. Contrary to my initial prediction, the girl, Liesel, is not Jewish but instead the orphaned daughter of two communist parents who were ostensibly murdered when finally caught by the Nazis. In any event, they never appear, which becomes painfully obvious during one particularly heartwrenching episode. Liesel spends most of the novel in the home of two poor but well-meaning foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who are patriotic enough not to be arrested, but dissenting enough that Hans has been refused admission to the Nazi party. Thus, through Liesel and the Hubermanns, we get a point of view of Nazi Germany to which we're not readily accustomed: not of the depraved and defiled victims of the Holocaust, nor of the gung-ho fundamentalist \"Heil-Hiterl!\"ing-every-five-seconds Nazis; but instead of those we rarely if ever hear from, those caught in the uncomfortable and inescapable middle.Oh, and the narrator.Zusak manages (ingeniously, I should add) to blend first- and third-person omniscient narrators by making his Death (with a capital \"D,\" as in the Grim Reaper), an intriguing if not entirely surprising choice given the novel's setting. Through Death, we not only get Liesel's thoughts, feelings, and actions ( as well as those of the others who come into the tale on occasion) but also his own: we get to see just how much he hates his job and yet simultaneously sees the necessity of it; we see how he reacts when he comes to collect his quarry (positively tear inducing, as in a sequence near the beginning when he describes what it was like to have to collect the small, limp, and sickly body of Liesel's younger brother); and we get to know some of his curious personality traits (would you ever think that Death would be obsessed with--of all things!--colors?). Zusak's choice of narrator is at once utterly risky and entirely genious--after all, we could have been stuck with a morose and altogether boring narrator. Instead, we have a perfectly round character who seamlessly melds the first- and third-person point of view.Novelists can have a nasty tendency to develop one or two main characters and leave the rest flat and uninteresting (case in point: essentially anything by the Clive Cussler's and Jackie Collins' of the contemporary scene--they fail to realize that people, not just plot, are interesting; unfortunately, many readers these days fail to realize this too). Zusak seems to suppress this urge however and manages to give us an entire cast of characters--including primary, secondary, and even tertiary characters--who are all very round and therefore very interesting. Take, for instance, the hunched-over old man named Pfiffikus, who at first seems to just be a cranky, foul-mouthed old codger but who we eventually find to be genuinely proud of his heritage. Then there is the Mayor's wide, who appears at first to be a paper-thin cutout of a character until we learn the reason for her projected flatness of character. And we could also discuss Tommy Mueller, a boy from the Hubermann's street who had so many ear infections (and operations on these ear infections) as a younger child that he has since been left with scars and an ever-present twitch.Think that's a lot of information about a few characters? Here's the kicker: Pfiffikus, the Mayor's wife, and Tommy Mueller are not even main characters! But they were developed believably and interestingly enough so it seems they are, or should be.This does not by any means imply that the main characters are boring stereotypes: they, too, are strikingly believable, and when the novel is finished, you genuinely feel as though they are people you know (or knew) from your own experiences. That is one of the most glorious aspects of this novel and--when it topples over its devastating denouement--one of the most tragic.I have gone to great pains in this review to avoid giving away too much of the plot because seeing what unfolds for these people you feel you know is another of the novel's glorious aspects. However, the plot is perhaps the weakest link in the novel's chain. The book is by no means predictable, but the only really eye-opening and fist-slamming-on-the-table event comes at the novel's aforementioned denouement. The rest of the plot does seem to drag a bit in places, but I suppose this comes naturally in the balance when you have such juicy and unforgettable characterization. Actually, that the plot is as good as it is with fantastic characterization like we are presented with is something of a miracle.In the years to come, this novel will rest on top of professors' shelves and \"Best\" lists alongside the likes of To Kill a Mockingbird, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Great Expectations. Certainly, you will be hard pressed to find a novel of this caliber much of anywhere on the current scene.

The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time.

But Death(/the author) just tells you what everyone's feeling or doing, so the characters are like flat automatons. There's no depth or pathos, in what should be a really fascinating story. Further, the narrator doesn't so much foreshadow as tell you everything that's going to happen, eliminating any suspense. Plus the tone is just annoying; kind of condescending and precious.And in lots of places the writing is just *bad* -- tons of passive voice (\"two giant words were struggled with, carried on her shoulder, and dropped as a bungling pair at Ilsa Hermann's feet\"), and it tries way too hard to be literary and deep and often just ends up being awkward and clunky.It's a shame this falls so flat for me, when there's so much awesome YA Holocaust literature out there -- The Devil's Arithmetic, Number the Stars, The Diary of Anne Frank and more.

Liesel, the young heroine of this novel is taken to live in Himmel street, Molching - a small town on the outskirts of Munich. Her father, a communist, has been arrested by the Nazis and her mother makes the difficult decision to have her fostered, to avoid the inevitable persecution.Life on Himmel street with the impoverished Hubermanns is tough and lonely at first.As years pass and the war becomes more intense, Liesel makes lasting bonds and learns a lot about friendship, love and loss. Much of the action turns on the transformative power of words as Liesel gradually collects books and stories - seeing a world beyond the fear, poverty and rubble of Himmel Street.The blank, inhuman face of the Nazi Party is always present and the way in which it controls by fear is a major theme. The persecution of Jews, communists and those that don\u2019t fully bow to the regime, still hits hard even though we are well versed in the history of this period.The language used in The Book Thief is lively and colourful. In fact, my feeling at the beginning was that some of the language was just too flamboyant. I\u2019ve been back to find some quotes to support this but I can\u2019t!

Death is sad at man\u2019s inhumanity and is tired, very, very tired by his massively increased workload in Europe, as atrocity piles upon atrocity.The Book Thief seems to be reaching classic status. It is big in concept, larger than life, quite magical and has an emotional punch.

(I read it because my book club selected it. They also made me read \"Twilight\" recently. I think my book club is suffering from an acute case of arrested development.)Most of what annoyed me about Markus Zusak's book are related to a few pet peeves of mine, and I'll limit my comments to those pet peeves. I'll even do it in a style Mr. Zusak might appreciate, with a numbered list and varying typefaces:\n1. Gimmicks\n It's one thing to have Death be your narrator -- and Mr. Zusak handled this less terribly than I'd expected, so I won't harp on it -- but Jesus, Mary and Joseph (a favorite expression of Mr. Zusak's characters), please stop breaking up the novel's text to give us lists with headings such as \"Three Small But Important Facts\" and little free-standing items such as \"A Small, Sad Note\" and definitions from the Duden Dictionary and drawings by the book's characters. It's overly cutesy at times, annoying at other times, and often completely unnecessary. Mr. Zusak even gives us character descriptions in these little breakaways. He couldn't just give us these descriptions through standard text, as novelists have been doing for hundreds of years? Is he perhaps trying to appeal to an ADD-addled, Twitter-addicted generation? Will all novels, in the future, have to look like Web pages to appeal to these kids? Or are we not giving them enough credit? Perhaps they still have the intelligence and attention spans to read standard text.\n2. Nazis, Hitler and the Holocaust\n I'm thinking about proposing some sort of moratorium on any author without some direct connection to Nazis or the Holocaust -- and that leaves only Elie Wiesel and a couple others at this point -- from writing novels about the Holocaust. It's just too easy to pull at the heartstrings with such stories. And if you're not damned good at it -- and sorry, Mr. Zusak, but you're not -- it can come across as cheapening the real horror of the Holocaust. The pathetic, angelic Jew hidden in the basement? Far too cheap, and far too easy, Mr. Zusak. The unselfish, almost saintly Germans who risk death to save him? The same. If it were nonfiction, fine, but this isn't. Instead it's an even more saccharine version of Anne Frank's story, which at least had the benefit of being true. It's almost like Mr. Zusak anticipates this criticism, and says in his author profile that he wanted to write about \"the things my parents had seen while growing up in Nazi Germany and Austria.\" That's vague enough for us to read just about anything into it, I suppose. Hey, maybe one of his parents hid a Jew in his or her basement! Or maybe not.\n3. The Healing Power of Literature\n Yes, we all love books and believe them valuable -- we wouldn't be readers of this book or any other if we didn't -- but reading doesn't solve everything. The escapism offered by literature is wonderful if you're trying to get away from your dreary job or the drudgery of school, but I find it unlikely it'll make you forget the bombs falling on your neighborhood if you're living in a country at war. I know, I know, I should have seen this part of the plot coming; the novel, after all, is called \"The Book Thief.\" I'm just getting sick of all these recently published books telling me how great books are. I know that already. Television shows don't feel a need to keep telling me how fantastic television is, and movies don't keep reminding me that movies are really wonderful, so books don't need to be so defensive either. Just be a really good book, then I'll remember how great literature is.OK, rant over. It was longer than I'd planned. In the end, at least in my opinion, this book is not for adults. As for its intended audience, it's definitely a better option for teenagers than is \"Twilight.\" But an even better option would be Wiesel's \"Night\" or Jerzy Kosinski's \"The Painted Bird\" -- real literature about the Nazi era by people who were actually there, didn't resort to gimmicks in their writing, and didn't feel a need to tell us how important books are. Instead, they just wrote important books.", "num_likes": 147, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2009", "book-club", "books-about-books"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1807703509", "review_id": "1807703509", "date": "Jan 02, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Johann (jobis89)", "user_url": "/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89", "text": "\u201cHis soul sat up.

In WWII-Nazi Germany, following the death of her brother and being separated from her mother, Liesel Meminger goes to live with a poor foster family on Himmel Street. In such dangerous times, the family hide a Jew down in their basement and a beautiful friendship based on books and reading develops.The Book Thief is a story about the power of words. Back in WWII, Hitler used the power of words to spread hatred, whereas our protagonist Leisel claims the words back and uses them in their most powerful way, for friendship and love.So many beautiful characters live within these pages...my favourites being Hans, Rudy and Max. All very interesting and rich and well-developed. Hans, Leisel\u2019s foster father, stood out most of all - his relationship with Liesel was simply beautiful. As a reader, you never forget the bond you form with the person who encourages your love for words and books, and Liesel received this encouragement not only from Hans, but also from Max, the Jew they have hidden in their basement. I also found myself appreciating Rosa, her foster mother, even more this time around. She\u2019s a character who seems quite harsh on the surface, but is actually brimming with love on the inside.One of my favourite things about this book is that it is narrated by Death. I loved this unique idea from Zusak and I really enjoyed the beautifully poetic way in which Death narrates the story. You can almost feel Death lingering over the story, similar to how Death lingered over those who lived back then in Nazi Germany - you knew death was coming, you just didn't know when or for who.It\u2019s hard to convey how much I love this book. I literally adore everything about it - the writing, the characters, the story, the message.

It's about me and the book masterpiece.*So, that has been my thought process for the last 15 min. So, bear with my incoherent rambling.All of you are aware about the scenario of the book. For those of you, who aren't: Holocaust. Heil Hitler. Germany. 1939-1945. Concentration camps. Air raids. Jews. Enough said. So, I won't even go into the synopsis.This book is oddly reminiscent of The Fault in Our Stars. And it's more than the veritable feels they evoke.I wish it were just that. Because then, I could easily blame nature for condemning us to a life-threatening disease, and we would be free of all blame. Hoo-fucking-ray. Here, I can't absolve mankind for inflicting such egregious pain, cruelty and horror on its own specie. Because it's us who are fucking responsible for the whole mess On a superficial level, we can say, the similarities would be: The feelings they evoke. It's the broken hearts trailing behind. It's the tears cascading down your face.But it's not even that.Let's be frank here. We all cried when Dumbledore died. We did. We wailed, we sniffled and cursed Snape to the deepest pits of hell.As devastating as that was, as much as we felt for Harry, it still isn't the same.Because when I completed \nThe Fault in Our Stars\n and now, \nThe Book Thief\n, I couldn't help but feel like a naive, little girl, inexperienced with the ways of world. Incognizant of crushing grief. Blissfully unaware of moments altering lives forever and leaving behind people, reeling from the change, gasping in their wake. It's like rudely being awakened to the realities of the world, by being drenched in stone-cold water or thrown headlong down a cliff.Abrupt. Unanticipated. Scary. That was what it was like.Brilliant. Magnificent. A Masterpiece.\nLiesel Meminger\nThe titular book thief. The girl with dollops of courage and pertinacious spirit, who experienced more tribulations and torment than people do in their entire lives. The girl who didn't break and cursed life after going through what she did.The girl who loved and hated words.She's right up there with Katniss in my respected-protagonists listI won't go into other characters. Because I don't have anything more to add that hasn't already been said.Suffice to say: they were all, and I mean everyone, incredible.Mr. Zusak definitely shows the ugly side of war. But, he shows the human-ness of it too.Of how, people in the face of adversity, still hold on to their humanity tenaciously.Of how people astound Death himself.Of how people still hope, when the cruel world gives them more reasons to hate, to burn, to shatter.\nOf how living is more than just existing.\n\n\nIt amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on.\n\nThe book was a poignant, agonizing account of one of the saddest period on Earth, told by Death himself (I kept imagining him as Morgan Freeman. I don't know why) And you've gotta read it because when Death tells a story, you really have to listen!The writing was phenomenal. It's not terrifying like the build-up before 50 feet drop in a roller coaster. It's not astounding like the rug pulled from your feet. Because we all know, it's a WW2 story, deaths are bound to happen. But that doesn't lessen the blow. In fact, the casual slipping in of the death of your favorite characters, makes you appreciate things as they are right now. Just when you'd heave a sigh of relief that no one is dying today, something happens, and you are left breathless.\nJust one tiny little complain\nI have already established, I have no patience at all. And this is one long book. Don't get me wrong, it is amazing, but really, really long.\nThe Part I Loved The Best\nThe epilogue. That part literally made me smile through my tears. The happiness, the joy coursing through me at that point was incredible. I was so proud of Liesel! Go, girl.\nOther Great Parts\nAccordion. Words. Lemon-like hair. Basements. Candies. Apples. Jesse Owens. A much anticipated kiss. Haunted by humans. Honesty. Fistfights. Swearing. Living. Writing. Goodbyes. Library. Dominos. Candles.Conclusion, in words of Mr. Zusak himself:I'm leaving you with a quote that shredded my heartwith it's raw honesty and palpable bitterness.\n\nI don't want to hope for anything anymore. I don't want to pray that Max in alive and safe. Or Alex Steiner.  Because the world does not deserve them.\n\n", "num_likes": 139, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["a-million-stars", "ammaaazzziinnggg", "cry-fest", "man-that-cover", "doesn-t-get-bettr-than-this", "cover-lust", "deserves-the-hype", "real-world-real-problems", "sad-sad-world", "books-that-stay"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/162904501", "review_id": "162904501", "date": "Apr 22, 2011", "rating": 4, "user_name": "karen", "user_url": "/user/show/45618-karen", "text": "i meant to write a review for this months ago, when i actually read it. now this poor book is sitting on my virtual shelves, unreviewed, unspouted-about. and i have been feeling very guilty about it because every book deserves a half-hour's written thoughts about it.but honestly.this book.at this point, i believe anyone who has an interest in it has already read it, right? i was one of the last people in the world to get on board. and it's like, how would you review a chocolate chip cookie? everyone already likes chocolate chip cookies, and me saying \"i like them because they taste good\" isn't going to sway any young minds. but this book does taste good.so i will leave it at that: \"good book\"but now i would like to address the issue of crying. everybody cries at this book (except tommy, who thought it was \"boring\".) i really wanted to read this because i wanted to cry at a book.

I need a book trashing therapy session, but I fully understand that others delighted in this bestseller! The pros:It is not as bad as The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. On the other hand, it is more than twice as long. That's bad.The intentions are good. On the other hand, they are executed in an awfully shallow and stereotypical way.Experimental fiction for young adults is great. When it works.The cons:It's wanting too much, failing to do anything. My personal dislike for the novel stems from the fact that I got hung up on the faulty use of German terms - presumably to spice up the boring dialogues, but having the effect of being comical if you are a German native speaker. Nobody uses the terms Saumensch, Saukerl, Arschloch and Schei\u00dfe that casually, on page after page, in situation after situation. It sounds ridiculous. And the other really strange feature of the text - from a linguistic standpoint - was the inclusion of German verbs in English sentences. To spuck, schmunzelling, and so on. What is the purpose of that? The author had to translate the words to the reader immediately in the following sentence, so the German speaking reader heard an echo that was bizarrely correcting the faulty grammar of the first voice. Like a reverse Google translation. Another thing that grated on my nerves was the inconsistency of this German \"local coloration\". When a character, a Jew hidden in a basement of a German home during the Second World War, creates a booklet for the main character - Liesel, the (very occasional) Book Thief - using Hitler's Mein Kampf as a palimpsest that shines through, we see that the \"original\" is a printed copy in English. Why not use a German palimpsest if you make the effort to create an \"illusion\" of original language whenever possible? (Note: I just checked in the library and the Swedish translation actually did change the palimpsest to a German version of the book, even using the letter type that was common in Germany at the time of Mein Kampf's publication. So the publisher edited away one illogical feature in the translation! But the English word \"to spuck\" is not worse than the Swedish \"att spucken p\u00e5 d\u00f6rren\". Why not just say \"spit\" in English if that is what the character does? Purpose of the random German here: showing off Middle School vocabulary skills, I assume?)So that is the linguistic bit. Let's move on.There is no plot. Period.The characters are not making sense and are not developed in any direction. They remain completely uninteresting, even though the topic is heartbreaking.The narrative style navigates badly between long stretches of descriptive prose and dialogues that lead nowhere and experimental bits that cause the reader to lose the ability to identify with either the plot or the writing style. They sort of cancel each other out. It feels like the author could not make the decision whether to write an intrigue-driven novel that appeals to the reader's wish for identification with the characters or to write a snotty reflection on his own characters from the omniscient perspective of all-powerful Death. So he did both. And that's where the story collapsed for me. Either would have worked well.

But I know that I enjoyed it more reading it as an adult than I would have as a young adult. (This book has been on my to-read list for a long time, since before I joined Goodreads, and I am extraordinarily grateful to the Goodreads YA Book Club group for choosing this as the first book read/the April 2008 book, because it\u2019s why I motivated myself to read it at this time, possibly ever given the number of books I want to read. And I\u2019m glad to have the opportunity to \u201cdiscuss\u201d it with others.)I have a penchant for reading books about the holocaust, and this is the most unique book about the Nazi era I\u2019ve read; in fact, it\u2019s one of the most unusual novels that I\u2019ve ever read. Although not for the very first time, I was able to feel empathy for and care about the non-Jewish German population during the holocaust era. I really appreciated the viewpoints shown.This book is lyrical and poetic and powerful, and thankfully at times funny. And I really got attached to many of the characters: Liesel, Hans, Max, Rudy, Rosa, etc., death also actually. But it\u2019s the author\u2019s choice of narrator that elevates the quality of this book. Death is the narrator and, in my opinion, the perfect one, although I\u2019d have never thought of this plot device myself; without Death telling the story I doubt this would have been a 5 star book for me. I loved how all of the characters felt like real people and how they changed, and how my opinions of them then shifted as well. The writing was so full of vivid imagery that I felt as though I was right smack in the middle with the people and place, more so than in most of the books that I read. I loved the books and pictures within the book.I found it to be both a sad and exhilarating book. Although I got choked up at several points, I did not feel that it was a depressing book. It\u2019s about friendship and love, the power of words, loss and abandonment, that which saves/heals us, and life and death.And reading the book struck me at the very core of my being. I really identified with Liesel in so many ways. Some of the events of her life felt similar to mine, although most of the details diverged significantly, but the emotional potency imparted in this book felt so real and influential to me. Death the narrator both drew me in and also gave enough distance from the tale to make the events more bearable.And I\u2019m really happy that the library gave me the paperback version that contains some discussion questions and an interesting interview with the author.", "num_likes": 83, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fiction", "readbooks-male-author-or-illust", "bookclub", "favorites", "goodreads-author", "groups-buddies", "novel", "young-adult", "books-about-books", "1-also-at-librarything"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/730442117", "review_id": "730442117", "date": "Sep 29, 2013", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Danielle", "user_url": "/user/show/23302801-danielle", "text": "2010 F.A.B.

Undeniably brilliant. A (not so) new favourite. \n\u201dI am haunted by humans.\u201d\n - DeathThis novel is a bonfire. It lures you in with heart-warming moments. A kind albeit dangerous gesture, the right words spoken, the words of young love, unspoken. But just like a fire when you get too close, to the characters, their struggles, their pain; It burns you.Zusak lines these moments up masterfully, like rows of dominoes. Each one careening into the next, toppling over until they\u2019re all left lying \u201dlike dead bodies\u201d and there\u2019s nothing left but heartbreak.It all ends in heartbreak. Now you think I\u2019ve spoiled the ending and I apologise for that but I should tell you that this novel is set in Nazi Germany, WW2 the backdrop in which the deaths of 45 million civilians worldwide were written in the sand. You\u2019ve read reviews and listened to people\u2019s warnings but you\u2019re not ready. It all ends in heartbreak.\n\u201dI guess humans like to watch a little destruction. Sandcastles, houses of cards, that\u2019s where they begin. Their great skill is their capacity to escalate.\u201d\nFittingly, death is our narrator. I was sceptical of the creative choice at first. I thought it would seem gimmicky but it didn\u2019t take long before I realised how wrong I was. Death is not a horrifying scythe-wielding hooded skeleton that longs to take our souls. He is more akin to a human, albeit one that has witnessed more devastation than we could ever imagine. As a narrator, Death has a propensity for ending chapters, even paragraphs with an ominous foreboding of what\u2019s to come. More often than not it is a reminder, after a light-hearted chapter, that this is not to be a fairy-tail ending. He laments the collection of souls. He forces himself, as much as possible, to look away from the grief of those left behind by the dead. He\u2019s tired and weary. In this story, \u201ceven death has a heart\u201d.This novel is heavy with symbolism of which I\u2019m sure a percentage escaped me entirely but what I did pick up on was powerful indeed. The most important of all of them is Books. Books are knowledge, resistance and ultimately empowerment. Mein Kampf was the ultimate propaganda and words were Hitler\u2019s most powerful weapon but they can also be a weapon of rebellion. Each of the books that Liesel saves/steals have great significance to the story as a whole. Max literally illustrates the power of words for Liesel in the book, \u2018The Word Shaker\u2019 which he writes and leaves behind for her. There is also symbolism in Hans\u2019 accordion, the food, and Death\u2019s fascination with colours amongst other things.Imagery is also potent in \u2018The Book Thief\u2019. Scenes from this novel etch themselves into you mind and don\u2019t let go. Rosa Hubermann sitting on the edge of the bed with her husband\u2019s accordion tied to her chest, Frau Holtzapfel layed flat with despair in the middle of the street, Hans Hubermann handing a piece of bread to a tired and hungry Jew beneath the hateful eyes of a brain-washed community, Liesel reading to her neighbours as their town is bombarded with allied bombs, a book thief\u2019s all too-late kiss. These might be fictional characters but they are the stories of very real people and this book is a testament to the notion that there are no winner\u2019s in war, only survivor\u2019s left with the grief of innocents lost.\n\u201dRudy Steiner was scared of the book thief\u2019s kiss. He must have longed for it so much. He must have loved her so incredibly hard. So hard that he would never ask for her lips again, and would go to his grave without them.\u201d\n", "num_likes": 89, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/43545087", "review_id": "43545087", "date": "Jan 18, 2009", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Stephen", "user_url": "/user/show/1413439-stephen", "text": "3.5 stars. The first thing I need to say is that it's quite possible that if I were to re-read this book at a later date, I might plant a gushing 5 ***** rating on this book (or at least an enthusiastic 4 stars). The writing is so gorgeous and descriptive that I truly found myself amazed by Zusak's prose. This is a book you could literally pick up and start reading at any page and find a memorable quote or a unique turn of phrase. It's just superbly well written. The best way to review this is to let the writing speak for itself so here are several passages from the book that demonstrate the high quality of the prose and the wonderful tone employed by the author( though I fear that some of the context and the emotional impact may not come through):\nThe secret sat in her mouth. It made itself comfortable. It crossed its legs.The last time I saw her was red. The sky was like soup, boiling and stirring. In some places, it was burned. There were black crumbs, and pepper, streaked across the redness.She tore a page from the book and ripped it in half. Then a chapter. Soon, there was nothing but scraps of words littered between her legs and all around her. The words. Why did they have to exist? Without them, there wouldn't be any of this. Without words, the F\u00fchrer was nothing. There would be no limping prisoners, no need for consolation or wordly tricks to make us feel better. What good were the words? She said it audibly now, to the orange-lit room. \"What good are the words?\" He was the crazy one who had painted himself black and defeated the world. She was the book thief without the words. Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like rain.I do not carry a sickle or scythe. I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold. And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I truly look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue. Upon her arrival, you could still see the bite marks of snow on her hands and the frosty blood on her fingers. Everything about her was undernourished. Wirelike shins. Coat hanger arms. She did not produce it easily, but when it came, she had a starving smile. \nOkay, so why 3.5 stars instead of four or five? The only answer I can give is that I didn't find myself captured by the story as a whole. I liked the characters, loved the writing and certainly loved the originality of the story.

The masterful freshman effort by Markus Zusak, The Book Thief represents the very best of what I love about books! The book has so many layers, and so much depth, yet it still becomes light and comic despite the very intense subject matter. The characters are most memorable, and you can\u2019t help but falling in love with the young German girl \u2018Liesel\u2019 and her \u2018Poppa\u2019.    Deep in the heart of Germany and at the height of WWII, we\u2019re exposed to the simple truth: all humans suffer and love the same! In The Book Thief, Zusak give us a rare glimpse of what\u2019s like to be a German and live in Nazi Germany in the pinnacle of the world\u2019s most destructive war, WWII. There are countless stories about the plight of the Allies, the citizens of occupied countries such as France and the unimaginable suffering of the Jews during the holocaust. What the author did was brilliant- he told an entire tale of WWII and the lives of Germans during this dark period in time. We always hear of \u2018bomb raids\u2019 by the Germans in British cities, leading to great mayhem and destruction. How about British bombing of Berlin, and subsequent death of so many innocent German civilians? The subject matter in the book is real, and very heavy at times. This book was so enjoyable to read, but at times it was a hard pill to swallow! I guess rules of \u2018human engagement\u2019 became somewhat obsolete during the great war. There was so much unnecessary death and suffereing around, that Markus Zusak decided to narrate the entire story through the eyes of Death itself! The results are little macabre yet inspiringly brilliant! \u201c The consequence of this is that I\u2019m always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both. \u201c I am haunted by humans\u201d-DeathIn The Book Thief, we see \u2018Death\u2019 narrating the story of \u2018Liesel\u2019, a young German girl whose book stealing and storytelling, makes her the epitome of love and suffering during the horrors of WW II. Despite being German, Liesel is herself persecuted, and forced to \u2018shelter\u2019 with foster parents. Her new \u2018Papa\u2019 and \u2018Mama\u2019 are key characters, and within their relationship we see the fabric for the remainder of the story.Liesel is courageous, loyal and very pragmatic due to the horrors that occur in her short life. The book is so well written, and the story flies by before you know it. The prose has many poetic undertones, and the cadence of the narrative is quite brilliant. Markus is a very talented author, with a big imagination and the skillset to translate it into the right words. We learn first hand that many Germans did NOT want to belong to the Nazi party, and were sternly ostracized for it. We also learn that a 14 year old German girl, can have much more courage than many soldiers actually doing the killing. We learn that the power of \u2018words\u2019 and good human deeds will always be more effective than bullets.   \u201dTrust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like rain.\u201d5 Stars!", "num_likes": 79, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["audiobooks", "historical-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/400761115", "review_id": "400761115", "date": "Aug 26, 2012", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Dave Schaafsma", "user_url": "/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma", "text": "This is a 550 page book, but it was (perhaps) was written for a middle grades audience, and it reads fast. I would call it an \"all ages book\" which means that tweens up can read and appreciate it. And I really think it is a classic, something everyone should consider reading. The book focuses on Liesel, a middle grades German girl who also as it turns out is a book thief. I'll explain. The (fictional) story is set in Munich during WW II; Liesel's (non-Jewish and non-Nazi) family is hiding Max, a Jew and an artist, in their basement during the war. (No, it's not only Anne Frank and those from other countries who sheltered Jews and other potential victims of the Third Reich during that war as people learned to, their horror, that the Nazis were actually killing literally millions deemed less than fully human in ovens; some non-Jewish Germans were also part of these efforts to save/protect their fellow Germans). The book is also about Liesel's friendship with Rudy and her relationships with her foster parents Rosa and Hans. I had a little struggle with the kind of quirky style early on, and was distracted by the fact that this was yet another book marketed to librarians and teachers. . . oh, it's about the power of books, duh, and reading, art, writing, expression, among many others, though finally I am more than okay with this. The Nazis burned books, which is part of how this book thieving got started, in a way.One of the most remarkable things about the book is that the story is narrated by Death, which at first I thought was a little corny/children's lit, then I really, really liked it, because it worked against sentimentality, which of course you expect with a Holocaust book. There was a lot of work Death was doing during WWII, including the Holocaust, of course. I like the way Death, knowing what he does and not being a particularly sentimental storyteller, reveals important plot information before it happens, and then we see it unfold. That's a narrative risk Zusak takes and it pays off wonderfully, I thought. Zusak has said he hoped people would find at least one writerly \"gem\" on each page, that he loved to write metaphors and I thought as writing it was well done. Of course you notice the language when it is striking and insightful, but Zusak makes sure the lyricism doesn't take away the focus on the actual horrors and suffering that are central to the tale. As I said, it took a bit for me to adjust to his style, but ultimately I found it very entertaining, and d moving, and lovely, within the important story it tells. Zusak wanted to tell about the Holocaust from a different angle, so he researched the resistance to Hitler within Nazi Germany. And as it turns out there were actually Germans who hated the fear- and hate-mongering Hitler, but didn't know how to organize to respond to the shit storm that was happening there. It shows a little bit of German resistance. And it's not sympathetic in the least about the something like 90% support--tens of millions of votes, for sure--for Hitler.

Another noteworthy point is that the first was stolen from snow and the second from fire. Not to omit that others were also given to her. All told, she owned fourteen books, but she saw her story as being made up predominantly of ten of them. Of those ten, six were stolen, one showed up at the kitchen table, two were made for her by a hidden Jew, and one was delivered by a soft, yellow-dressed afternoon.When she came to write her story, she would wonder exactly when the books and the words started to mean not just something, but everything. Was it when she first set eyes on the room with shelves and shelves of them? Or when Max Vandenburg arrived on Himmel Street carrying handfuls of suffering and Hitler's Mein Kampf ? Was it reading in the shelters? The last parade to Dachau? Was it The Word Shaker? Perhaps there would never be a precise answer as to when and where it occurred. In any case, that's getting ahead of myself. Before we make it to any of that, we first need to tour Liesel Meminger's beginnings on Himmel Street and the art of saumensching:Upon her arrival, you could still see the bite marks of snow on her hands and the frosty blood on her fingers. Everything about her was undernourished. Wirelike shins. Coat hanger arms. She did not produce it easily, but when it came, she had a starving smile.Her hair was a close enough brand of German blond, but she had dangerous eyes. Dark brown. You didn't really want brown eyes in Germany around that time. Perhaps she received them from her father, but she had no way of knowing, as she couldn't remember him. There was really only one thing she knew about her father. It was a label she did not understand.A STRANGE WORDKommunistShe'd heard it several times in the past few years.\"Communist.\"There were boardinghouses crammed with people, rooms filled with questions. And that word. That strange word was always there somewhere, standing in the corner, watching from the dark. It wore suits, uniforms. No matter where they went, there it was, each time her father was mentioned. She could smell it and taste it. She just couldn't spell or understand it. When she asked her mother what it meant, she was told that it wasn't important, that she shouldn't worry about such things. At one boardinghouse, there was a healthier woman who tried to teach the children to write, using charcoal on the wall. Liesel was tempted to ask her the meaning, but it never eventuated. One day, that woman was taken away for questioning. She didn't come back.THE BLURB: A story about, among other things: A girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist-fighter, and quite a lot of thievery. . . .an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul. Winner of the 2007 BookBrowse Ruby Award. Set during World War II in Germany, Markus Zusak\u2019s groundbreaking new novel is the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can\u2019t resist \u2013 books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau. This is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul.MY THOUGHTS: The Book Thief is brutal and beautiful. It is sad and inspiring. It is unforgettable and haunting. It is a book that should be read by everyone. The Book Thief is narrated by Death himself. There are some things you probably need to know about Death. He does not carry a sickle or a scythe. He only wears a hooded black robe when it is cold. He doesn't have those skull- like facial features so often ascribed to him. Do you want to know what he truly looks like? Take a look in the mirror. And, believe it or not, he has a heart. We meet Leisel for the first time in January 1939. She is nine years old. Death also meets her for the first time when he stops to collect the soul of her six year old brother. He will meet her again. And Leisel is about to steal her first book. The book is written in parts, each titled and with a brief description, eg Part Three, Mein Kampf, featuring: the way home - a broken woman - a struggler - a juggler - the attributes of summer - an Aryan shopkeeper - a snorer - two tricksters - and revenge in the shape of mixed lollies. Scattered throughout the chapters are little notes from Death - 'A Nice Thought - one was a book thief. The other stole the sky.'The author's language is almost poetic - ' As she crossed the river, a rumour of sunshine stood behind the clouds. ', 'the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Leisel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out, like the rain. ' - in places, and in others it is clipped and brutal. This is not an easy book to read at first, but increasingly as I read I could feel the author's words embracing me, challenging me. It is a worthy read and has earned itsplace as my favorite book of the year to date.All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own.

It included romance between Liesel and Rudy, historical fiction of the Holocaust and the adventure and risk of taking in a Jew. To me, the icing on the cake has to be the theme. I have picked two. One was about the human spirit and the other was the strength of words. Both play a really important role in this book that I won\u2019t go into full detail with, but is INCREDIBLE! The way that Zusak intertwines these themes into a plot about a book thief omg girl amazes me. I will first share my thoughts about the romance. In the beginning, personally, I didn\u2019t see Rudy and Liesel as a thing. I thought that they are just friends and that should just be it. Once I reached the Jesse Owens chapter is when this all changed. I realized that a boy running around with a charcoaled face pretending to be Jesse Owens does not come around every day. He has just as much craziness as Liesel did. After that I shipped them. My favorite part was of course The Whistler. It showed more of the love that embodies them. Even Rudy\u2019s comment in this chapter still haunts my consciousness. \u201c\u2018How about a kiss, Saumensch?\u2019\u201d pg. 241. Just that line made be 10x more angry that he dies. Even when Liesel went to Amper river and repeated that phrase became too much to bare. The love was clearly there. The one thing that I regret in this book was of course that Liesel didn\u2019t kiss Rudy when he was alive. I understand why. Zusak just HAD to play with our hearts and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have put a kiss with them in real life. It\u2019s just those things that you would regret and accept. I have accepted it and I also haven\u2019t at the same time, if that makes sense.I think this would be a terrible review if I didn\u2019t mention Max Vandenburg. This one part of my mind for some reason thought that Max and Liesel could have been a good couple. I quickly dismissed this, telling myself\u2019 \u201cRUDY AND LIESEL FOREVER!!!!\u201d I believe the best memory of him was his illustrations. The illustrations in The Standover Man and in The Word Shaker were very articulate and creative. The descriptions touched my soul and the picture almost made me cry. The way the story was made (Max\u2019s stories) was so beautiful, and the illustrations especially did not let me down. I loved how he incorporated metaphors in his own drawing! That is art in my book. But my favorite art of all was the tightrope leading towards the dripping sun, calling both Liesel and Max towards it. There\u2019s something so simplistic about it that I really enjoyed, along with it\u2019s different meaning. I read about Markus\u2019s research that went into this story too. It was so detailed that he researched about apple trees for when Liesel and Rudy were stealing the apples from local farms. That dedication to the series is amazing and seems underrated in my opinion. I mean he even said that he hated research, yet he researched the most minuscule details to make sure it\u2019s accurate and that takes a lot of patience, something that I personally don\u2019t have. Zusak\u2019s overall writing for this makes me give it 5 stars. The story is beautiful, down to the lemon hair. I wish that I wrote like that and hopefully more do too. If this book hasn\u2019t changed my life yet, it will. With this new perspective on death and humans in general, my attitude will probably come close to Liesel Meminger and her resilience.

I do admit to feeling a little silly for \u2013 reading it very late and more so for writing a review! The book\u2019s story is quite obviously its biggest strength, as also the courage & values of its main characters. You cannot but help being transported to those difficult times in Germany during the Second World War.Liesel is the lead character of the book who travels with her mother and brother to the town of Molching. Her brother dies tragically during the journey and this is when she comes across the book \u201cThe Gravedigger\u2019s handbook\u201d which she whisks away. She is adopted by Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Hans, in particular, is very sensitive to her state of mind and takes care to allow her to settle in. Liesel develops an interest in reading and is taking away books during burning events and even the Mayor\u2019s place. She develops a close friendship with Rudy. The family hide a young Jewish man Max in their basement. Liesel & Max form a sense of bonding \u2013 each with their own personal pains & nightmares. As the war enters its final phase, with Germany facing defeat, the hardships of the family increase. Quite expectedly, there is a toll in terms of human life. The book features very strong value based characters in Liesel, Hans, Rudy and Max. There are various parts of the story which are very moving \u2013 Liesel\u2019s personal tragedy / pain and nightmares, Max\u2019s situation & thoughts, Hans standing up for his values, and the trauma they face. The narration of the story by Death adds a further dimension allowing expression of some very striking thoughts & passages. I found the references to \u2018book thief\u2019 to be a little forced though and the book could have been crisper. This is a very powerful story with characters, their values, approach to life and pain which will stay with you for long.My rating: 4.5 / 5.", "num_likes": 70, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2483090700", "review_id": "2483090700", "date": "Oct 15, 2018", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Joey R.", "user_url": "/user/show/11232712-joey-r", "text": "3.0 Stars. I just finished \u201cThe Book Thief\u201d by Markus Zusak. This was a book I was looking forward to reading based on the great reviews and the fact that I was a huge fan of both \u201cThe Diary of Ann Frank\u201d and \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d which I read this book compared favorably to. First, because I had such high expectations for this book, I might be a little harsher in my review than I would for a book I have heard nothing about. With that being said, I felt like \u201cThe Book Thief\u201d was too long and slow paced to get a higher rating. I really liked the well drawn characters Liesel and Rudy and watching their friendship grow, but the book took a very long time in moving the plot along and I found myself bored several times throughout the book. I even fell asleep while reading on a couple of occasions, a sure sign that the book was going nowhere fast. \u201cThe Book Thief\u201d did have some good sections and I have definitely read much worse, but unless you enjoy a very slow paced, character study then leave this book on the shelf and move on to faster paced, better thought out storylines. Sometimes reputation and word of mouth are a far cry from what your opinion is when you read the same book. In this case average and depressing are the best words I can use to describe what others might say is the best book they have ever read.

I truly could not have handled this intense book alone \u2764\ufe0fSoooo.... this book destroyed me.This book hurt me in a way that I didn\u2019t think any book could. This book had me sobbing so hard that I had a heartache AND a headache.All the reviews were telling me I couldn\u2019t handle this book. And to them I said: No, I\u2019ll be fine. I didn\u2019t cry when I read The Fault in Our Stars, which is apparently an automatic tear-jerker. I\u2019LL BE FINE, GUYS! But I was wrong. I was naive. I didn\u2019t know what the future had in store for me.\u2728The future\u2728:But aside from feeling like a dried prune after crying so much, I love this book. The characters leave such a lasting impression on the reader, and the writing is incredible. The story is told from the point of view of death. And death was such a candid narrator. He even spoiled some of what happened later in the book; and even though death told me what was going to happen, I was still shattered to pieces at the end, which speaks again to how amazing the writing is.This book familiarizes the reader with death and grief but also portrays kindness and beauty. Afterall, I think it\u2019s beautiful that even after enduring such intense grief and sadness that a ten year old girl can still have moments to enjoy her childhood, going on adventures with her best friend and stealing books.One of the easiest 5/5s I\u2019ve ever given.\nThe Characters\n- Although death is the narrator, this story\u2019s primary focus is Liesel Meminger.\nThe book thief has struck for the first time \u2013 the beginning of an illustrious career.\n Liesel\u2019s life is plagued by tragedy and sadness, so, in reading, she finds an escape. She discovers a love for letters, words, stories. The Book Thief follows Liesel from her brother\u2019s graveside, to listening to her foster father - Papa - playing the accordion while her foster mother calls him a saumensch, to hiding a jew in their basement, to clutching her stolen books in the bomb shelter.\nSomewhere in all the snow, she could see her broken heart, in two pieces. Each half was glowing, and beating under all that white.\n Liesel\u2019s story is absolutely heartbreaking. She deserved so much more from the world. That's all I can write about that without tearing up again honestly.- Rudy is such a loveable character. I loved their friendship so much.\n\u201cWhat do you want to kiss me for? I'm filthy.\u201d\u201cSo am I.\u201d\n I loved reading about all their adventures together. The ending though asdfghjhgf. Now that was a lot of damage. (view spoiler)[Even though death told us he was going to die, I WAS SO HURT BY RUDY DYING. THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW FOR ME. The tears started flowing like a river at that point. The image of Liesel kissing Rudy\u2019s dead body hurt me so bad \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\nShe leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Liesel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection.\n (hide spoiler)]- I loved Liesel\u2019s relationship with her father! They understood each other on a deep, emotional level. They didn\u2019t even have to say anything to one another, and they understood what the other meant.\nPossibly the only good to come out of these nightmares was that it brought Hans Hubermann, her new papa, into the room, to soothe her, to love her.He came every night and sat with her. The first couple of times, he simply stayed - a stranger to kill the aloneness. A few nights after that, he whispered, \"Shhh, I'm here, it's all right.\" After three weeks he held her. Trust was accumulated quickly, due primarily to the brute strength of the man's gentleness, his thereness. The girl knew from the outset that Hans Hubermann would always appear midscream, and he would not leave.\n He was such a kind soul but also a brave soul, opening his home and heart to Max and to the other Jews when the rest of Germany sided with Hitler (either because they were fascists too or because they were too scared to speak out against him). Hans Hubermann also encouraged Liesel\u2019s reading, which is so important for a parent to do. Having such a supportive parent was the least the world could do for Liesel after all the grief it had given her \ud83d\ude2a\nThe Writing\nLike I said before, the writing is so unique. Brilliant, honestly. Having death as the narrator may seem a little strange at first, but hearing his narration actually heightened the emotional response from me as the reader. As you can see from my very angry status updates below lol, I was super upset with the narrator for what was happening in the story. Yet this book humanizes death in a way that, in my opinion, reveals more about human nature than death.\nThe consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both.\n I was addicted to the writing in this book. Every sentence is perfect. Death\u2019s sarcastic but hard-hitting statements of the obvious, the realistic evolution of the character\u2019s relationships, and the beautiful imagery Zusak uses to evoke such an emotional response from the reader. Ugh - chef\u2019s kiss.\nThe Narration\nMy book was narrated by Allan Corduner AND LET ME JUST SAY - whoever cast this man as the narrator deserves a raise. This sounds so weird, but this man\u2019s voice is exactly how I imagine death would sound. His low and bitter British voice was everything I needed for this. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THIS VIA AUDIOBOOK! I enjoyed it a lot (apart from the crying \ud83e\udd2a)In conclusion, this book will hurt you, which is why I recommend it with caution. I don\u2019t cry easily, so if you\u2019re looking for a book that will make you cry, then this is definitely the book for you! But if you\u2019re looking for a light read, then this is DEFINITELY not for you because this book is traumatic. Still, the writing is incredible, and I connected with all of the characters so it\u2019s a solid 5/5!", "num_likes": 67, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3013165", "review_id": "3013165", "date": "Jul 12, 2007", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Magdalena", "user_url": "/user/show/188289-magdalena", "text": "Markus Zusak\u2019s The Book Thief has one of the most original and striking narrators since Julian Barnes introduced us to the canny perspective of a woodlice in History of the World in 10\u00bd Chapters. There\u2019s no caginess about it. The first word of the first chapter\u2019s title makes it clear that the narrator is a personified Death: the not so grim reaper. Having Death as the narrator for a book set in Germany at the start of World War II starts the book on exactly the right blackly humorous tone which continues throughout. It\u2019s a very Jewish type of humour. I\u2019m thinking of the classic Borsch belt comedians like Sholem Aleichem, Milton Berle or perhaps even later comedians like Billy Crystal or Woody Allen. As Harvard Professor Ruth Wisse quoted in her Radio National piece on Jewish Humour, Saul Bellow calls \u201ccharacteristically Jewish\u201d a story in which laughter and trembling are so curiously mingled that it is not easy to determine the relations between the two, or as Death puts it: \u201cA final dirty joke. Another human punchline.\u201d (12) This is part of the power of what Zusak does in The Book Thief.Although The Book Thief succeeds on the most post-modern of levels, its impact on the reader is as much due to superb old fashioned plot and characterisation as anything else. It is, afterall, simply a beautiful and painful story of a young girl as she deals with an important and tragic point in history. Liesel is nine and her younger brother six, when her mother takes her and her brother to Munich to be given to foster parents. En route her brother dies: \u201cWhen the coughing stopped, there was nothing but the nothingness of life moving on with a shuffle, or a near-silent twitch. A suddenness found its way onto his lips then, which were a corroded brown colour, and peeling, like old paint.\u201d (20) Liesel is then thrust into a nightmare/dream existance which involves the thieving of a book, the development of a relationship with her foster parents, Rosa and Hans Huberman, and her growing sense of self as she ages during this period. Liesel\u2019s coming of age is a key part of the plot, and it is possible to read the book as simply the story of Liesel. Certainly Liesel\u2019s characterisation is enough to carry the story. When Liesel arrives at the Hubermans she is scared, almost mute, and refuses to get out of the car or into a bath, but we have already begun to love her through the lens of Death\u2019s sympathyDeath\u2019s own role as a character is a strong one, and he hints at a conflicted inner life. In some ways he makes himself a slave of humans \u2013 dealing with the impact of their wars and atrocities: \u201cThe boss, however, does not thank you. He asks for more.\u201d An afterlife is hinted at very subtly, but never clarified \u2013 bodies go cold and melt and sometimes warm again as their souls are gently removed. That\u2019s all the reader gets. The rest is left open to imagination, as is the direction that Death as character might be moving in. He\u2019s allegorical in one sense, but so real in his sensations, longings and emotions, that it isn\u2019t hard to imagine some kind of progression for him. As character, he may not be nice, but he has his charms, as typified by the last line in the book. Death\u2019s most striking punchline is delivered at the very end. And like the best Jewish humour, it works by turning both fear and convention on its head, in this case, making humans the \u2018other\u2019 haunting entity. It also places the final spotlight directly on life, and the celebration and triumph of it, even in the face of man-made hatred and horror. The Book Thief  is a wonderful book, full of beauty, pain, longing, joy, and sensuality. It never skirts the horror of war, death, or pain, nor does it flinch at the very real tragedy it immerses itself, sometimes graphically, in. But even at its ugliest, this is a story of the beauty and celebration, however fleeting, of human life.

All I know is that this is one story that will stick with me for years. To me, the most beautiful people are those who have been through hell, yet still manage to dazzle like heaven. Liesel was one of them. Beautifully stoic, the girl was a beacon of hope in the midst of darkness. Her foster mom, Rosa Hubermann, was similar to Liesel in this aspect. You might say that she verbally abused Liesel and beat her with a wooden spoon whenever she felt like it, but she's just a soul who's misunderstood. Her way of showing affection is strange, but it's just in her nature to put survival above all else. She knows how to turn a crisis around and deal with the situation like the boss she is. Her filthy mouth is just an added bonus. One was a book thief. The other stole the sky.Her relationships with Max, the Jewish fist fighter, and Rudy, her lemon-haired partner in crime were the best parts of the whole story. I liked how the simplest of pleasures like thievery and books solidified their connections. It shows how all you need in life is to be surrounded by the right people to feel like you're at the top of the world. Somewhere inside her were the souls of words.Fuelled by her desire for words, she built her world one word at a time. From the first book she stole which happened to be a Grave-diggers' manual, to the one she wrote herself, Liesel reveled in words. Words were her savior, words were her misery. I'm positive that the power of words is something every reader is familiar with. It's something we have experience first hand, so we know exactly how powerful of an effect they have on us.  The Book Thief  really makes you think about all that. Some things you know all along, but you don't realize them until they're put in coherent words.The words. Why did they have to exist? Without them, there wouldn't be any of this. Without words, the Fuhrer was nothing. There would be no limping prisoners, no need for consolation or wordly tricks to make us feel better.The idea of death being the narrator was astounding. A grim reaper with a beating heart is not something you come across very often.

It reads like an omnibus of short stories all held together by a handful of characters. Much has already been written about this book so I will not muddy the waters too much more. Suffice to say that as a young girl, Liesel Meminger, The Book Thief, is being fostered parented by Mr. and Mrs. Hubermann in the small German town of Molching. WW2 is well underway and whilst most German citizens are held in Adolf Hitler\u2019s thrall the Hubermann\u2019s are most definitely not.

This probably has the most remarkable and unique prose I've read since...well, when I can remember. Last year I guess. And I read so many amazing books last year.  Couple such wonderful prose with a most unlikely narrator, and the remarkable scale is stepped up in ways I never thought possible. I don't think I wanted to believe it when I first guessed that death was the narrator of the story. It seemed absurd to me at first. I won't lie. I had to stop. Contemplate. Imagine how the story was going to play out. Exactly how?I just stared for a while, wondering, really, about the possibility of such an oddity. I only had to read to find out. And I read beyond a doubt that it was true. It's not a very hard puzzle to piece together. A story + An atrocious, bloodsoaked time and setting + An official collector of souls/unofficial story narrator = A suspicious audience dragged along for the ride as the collector made his rounds. So do I need to say that throughout this book, I was filled with a nagging and haunting sense of foreboding? Who would be next? With death making a bold, explicit, and firm assertion of his status as the omniscient narrator, it was all I could do to be alert and wary of the ending of this story. To be alert and suspicious with every page I turned. It was always only a question of who would be next. \u25b6 \n\nDEATH IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE BEST NARRATORS TO EVER RELATE A STORY\n\nDeath is a spoilering spoiler with a beautiful, endearing, philosophical and sympathetic voice(perhaps, in reciprocation, I became an immensely sympathetic reader). He divulges quite early in the story that he's not into withholding information, building suspense and creating a mysterious air to sate our needs. He contemplates the contrasting qualities of humanity. It's so clear, timeless and enduring as he is, he can't claim a full understanding of the human race. He's seen it all, and yet he's continually surprised by humanity's inconsistency - and consistency. By our ability to kill and nurture, destroy and build, in the same vein, and hate and love with equal, unwavering passion. I, myself, marveled at it all over again. Of course, it wasn't new information to me, but the way death presented it, it was almost hypnotic. Like another great love song: Same idea, same theme, different lyrics, different melody, and a sure and lasting effect. On me that is. Only it wasn't a love song he sang, it was an ugly war song. The lyrics sang about the futility and tiredness of the business, the violent and disturbing facets of human nature that won't let us stop fighting until there's nothing left to fight for and no one left to fight(as death tells us that that period was not only marked by the bloody 2nd world war, but also by little battles here and there that left an endless supply of souls for collection. Even with the many deaths caused by our own hands, we sought for more. Proof of man's determination and relentlessness in the vilest situations). And by the way, I saw many instances where death was referred to in pronoun \"he,\" some are probably going He.He.He.He too, right now. Like I did. It's so easy to adapt the referenced pronoun. He - How do you know death wasn't a woman? It was definitely humanized and personalized, but not genderized. Women can also wear black robes too. Aaaand I'm kidding. Only mildly. I remember when we studied about the world war 2, Hitler's cruelty, Stalingrad and whatnot in class. I quietly stood up and excused myself from the lesson and spent the rest of the period in the toilet. Such cruelty. I didn't care for it at all. I didn't want to hear about it. And I don't think I'll ever truly want to hear about the gravity of Hitler's heinous crimes, there are enough mad people to deal with in this time already and I don't need to visit the 1940's to experience the sadistic blend of cruel and crazy. I'm pigheaded like that. But funnily, I love books like this that allow me snippets of events that marked the time.\u25b6\n\nDID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE WORDS?\n\n The injury of words. Yes, the brutality of words. The beauty of words.The clarity of words.The safety of words.The power of words.I think every reader knows. Liesel knew. And the people whose lives became entwined with hers knew. It's so easy to relate with Liesel because of this. It's so easy to love this story just because of this: it impresses on the efficacy of words, their ability to endorse everything from good to evil. This story shows the two extremes, with words as seeds which could either grow into edible and nutritious fruits or poisonous, suffocating weeds, and even ultimately weapons of mass destruction. It was the loveliest thing to read about Liesel's introduction to the world of books, follow her slow but admirable progress. Though death was the narrator, I could still hear Liesel's - and every other characters' - voice in the story. Clearly. And I loved Liesel's character, even from the early age of ten, it was easy to tell she assumed a lot of presence and with much gusto too. And the words! So many lovely words from so many characters in here. And now I'm getting that feeling again. I want to pluck the words out of the pages of this book and pocket them. I want to carve the words in here on my skin, have them etched deep in me, on skin and soul, forever. A tattoo would be milder but a carving would feel closer, deeper. I feel like this book is a gift to me. A gift to all readers.\u25b6 \n\nA FEW RANDOM BUT MEMORABLE MENTIONS\n\n\u2714 The characters. Liesel Meminger(the book thief and daughter), Hans(the father and accordionist) and Rosa(the stern but affectionate mother) Hubermann, Max Vandenberg(the Jewish fistfighter turned refugee), Rudy Steiner(hmm...the lemon-haired boy next door) and all the extras. I can't think of a more spirited and lovable set of characters right now. I fell in love with Liesel and Hans over and over again throughout this story. They made the perfect portrait of a phenomenal father-daughter relationship.\u2714 Hans Hubermann.Zusak epitomized such simple virtues as selflessness and kindness with Hans' character. And apart from that, his character made me wonder about how one careless swing of events can cause a meandering of fate. A narrow escape from death. With a story like Hans Hubermann's, it's almost easy to believe that you get as much as you give, that the world can sometimes be that generous and fair.\u2714 I only picked up all the foul German words in this book. **smiles sheepishly** It seems those are the easiest and first things to grab from a foreign language, for me. I'm properly shamed, no need to tell me. But I'll say one thing in my defense. It's all Rosa Hubermann's fault. \u2714 Why The Late Show with Stephen Colbert would be an approved show on my child's watch list.\u2714 Even though the sadness was a slow and creeping one, it was a hard and heavy blow when it finally culminated in a climaxing hollowness. Even though I was alert and waiting, I did not expect the ending. Maybe the signs were all there, and others saw it coming. I don't know, I can be blissfully blind like that.MY HOUSEMATEWHAT MY FACE SAIDWhat my lips lied: NO\u2714 I already said the writing was beautiful. Astoundingly poetic and beautiful. And I already told you I was surprised by it(and the narrator). It seems there are still some tricks left in that old and crumbling book of surprises and ambushes. Yet another book that restored my withered faith. And I just want to shout it from the rooftop.\u2714 I loved Max's short stories so much!\u2714 Why are humans condemned to love the dead and not the living? Why do we love more in death?\u274e The only problem with reading a great book like this is when the journey's over, I never quite know what to do next, what to read next. I'm just so lost right now.\u25b6 \n\nSOME QUOTES I LIKED. ALL MADE BY DEATH.\n\n\nHe had already cheated me in one world war but would later be put into another (as a perverse kind of reward), where he would somehow manage to avoid me again. To most people, Hans Hubermann was barely visible. An un-special person. Certainly, his painting skills were excellent. His musical ability was better than average. Somehow, though, and I'm sure you've met people like this, he was able to appear as merely part of the background, even if he was standing at the front of a line. He was always just there . Not noticeable. Not important or particularly valuable.The first time we were in the vicinity of each other Hans was twenty-two years old, fighting in France. The majority of young men in his platoon were eager to fight. Hans wasn't so sure. I had taken a few of them along the way, but you could say I never even came close to touching Hans Hubermann. He was either too lucky, or he deserved to live, or there was a good reason for him to live.  You see? Even death has a heart.  He was the crazy one who had painted himself black and defeated the world. She was the book thief without the words. I've seen so many young men over the years who think they're running at other young men . They are not . They're running at me.  She was a girl. In Nazi Germany. How fitting that she was discovering the power of words. ...and they never saw Arthur Berg again. As for me, Ican tell you that I most definitely saw him.  Not many men are lucky enough to cheat me twice.  Where's the fight? he wondered. Where's the will to hold on?  Exactly what kind of people Hans and Rosa Hubermann were was not the easiest problem to solve. Kind people? Ridiculously ignorant people? People of questionable sanity? What was easier to define was their predicament. \u201cI wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race - that rarely do I even simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant...I am haunted by humans.CHRISTMAS GREETINGS FROM MAX VANDENBURG \"Often I wish this would all be over, Liesel, but then somehow you do something like walk down the basement steps with a snowman in your hands.\"A human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both. Please, trust me. I most definitely can be cheerful. I can be amiable. Agreeable. Affable. And that's only the A's. Just don't ask me to be nice.

Her curiosity, her determination, her strength, her unwillingness to be anything other than herself !! So special! She questions authority & the world around her; she's a rebel, but not without a cause. I absolutely loved her tenacity, and seeing her relationships grow with everyone she comes into contact with.  -  Papa Hubermann : Oh, how I love him so. He's a symbol of hope, of love, of courage in the face of disaster. He is, 100%, one of my all-time favorite characters. He's patient, and strong. He knows what he believes, and he won't bow down to anything that comes against those beliefs, and I LOVE that. Just the best. (He almost made rolling cigarettes seem cool-almost) -  Rudy Steiner : Such a boy, ugh. I love him. He was a sweet, fierce friend to Liesel. I don't want to spoil anything for those who maybe haven't read this book yet (pretty sure I'm the last one, though), but I just want to say: Rudy hit me hard. The rest of the characters were exquisite. There wasn't a single person I didn't appreciate. They were all multi-dimensional - even the side characters! All of them! I don't know how Zuzak accomplished that, but he did, and it's great.The setting of Molching, specifically Himmel Street, was so realistic. I mean, I believed the town was real until I finished the book, googled the town and realized it was a fictionalized take on the actual town of Olching, Germany. The colors that Death uses throughout the novel helped a lot in picturing the world; it was special and unique, and it could've been done in a cheesy way, but it wasn't because Zuzak is a wizard of words. I liked the conflict, the topic this story brings up about war and politics, about words and their power and the equally powerful tool of free thinking. The notion that the creative among us are the first to get their voices silenced (by burning books, paintings, destroying albums, etc.) because we've found a way to reach those where they're at, and potentially show the masses a different viewpoint rather than the one most would be exposed to if they only read the newspaper. It's a topic that I don't think is ever, or will ever be \"out of season\" or \"off-topic.\" SO MUCH IMPORTANCE; SO MUCH DEVASTATION. I'm a massive fan of this book, of this story.

Excited about the opportunity to participate in World Book Night USA 2012, I chose this book to give away. Initially my choice was a selfish one. I had read many of the 30 books up to give, some of which I loved, but hated the thought of a need to re-read in preparation to be a knowledgeable giver. The Book Thief had outstanding reviews and had been on my list for some time so it seemed the perfect match. I'm so glad I chose this as it was an incredible read.I had heard that The Book Thief was targeted to young adults. This surprised me as I started to read. The Book Thief seems so adult. I would have turned the tables and called it an adult book suitable for young adults. In an interview with the author I learned that The Book Thief was promoted to young adults in the UK but was pitched to adults in the US. No matter, it's a book that crosses ages seamlessly and is suitable for both. Such a simple story and yet one so complex. That's The Book Thief in my humble opinion. Told by a strange narrator, Death, it was at first difficult to to get into the rhythm or pacing of the story. Soon, I was caught up in the setting of World War II Germany, and a young girl, Liesel Meminger, who lives on the outskirts of Munich with her foster family, The Hubermanns. Hitler, the air raids, bomb shelters, a Jewish man hidden in her basement, the complexities of war, and the normality of daily life, all these make up Liesel's world on Himmel Street. Liesel's survival is dependent on so many things but learning to read, her love of words and the theft of books, soon become the apparent glue that maintains her spirit. The characters who surround Lisesel on her book stealing adventures on Himmel Street, are beautifully rendered and not ones I will soon forget. Each reader, I think, will have a favorite. Mine is the same that Zusak mentions in an interview. Rudy, Liesel's next door neighbor, and stalwart friend, who stands by her side in many escapades, who begs a kiss for his deeds, is the epitome of what a friend is and what friendship means making him the outstanding character for me. Death cannot be denied, either as a reality, nor as the narrator. That Zusak chooses Death to take us on this journey is an excellent choice. Death allows us to see with a perspective we might not have had otherwise. Not all is wrapped up with a bow, and I am left with questions and I'm glad for this. What Zusak lets me know and what Zusaks leaves to my interpretation seems just right. The Book Thief is not an easy book to describe. There is love, sadness, hope, humor and even wonder. The ending is powerful. I highly recommend it and wish I could give it away all over again. It is that good.

This is a story about War World II, it's a story that'll beat you senseless. Liesel Meminger is a girl who's got a taste of the ugly side of life from a very young age, at that of 10. She loses everyone and she is fostered by a very nice middle-aged couple. She quickly grows accustomed to the couple and later on she even loves them. Living through hardship and immaculate torture in Nazi Germany while being promised a better future, all they get is war, hunger and death. Liesel is a girl who loves her next-door neighbor very dearly even though she doesn't do anything about it until it's very late. Liesel is also a girl who loves reading, a girl who 'steals' books, she finds comfort in them. In them, I imagine, she can be anyone and anything she wants. In them she can be a girl living in peace, and ease.It's such a heart-wretching read, such a brilliant and unique book. It's worth every single tear I shed. I found that Markus Zusak isn't only an amazing writer, who can make you cry with the most innocent and simplest words but he can also put to words feelings, so pure and utter wonderful, that you'll find yourself, like me, lost in a world of chaos, war, hardships but despite all these you'll see the love like a shining beacon, you'll be able through his words to feel the love palpable in your very soul, in your very being.", "num_likes": 56, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["tear-jerkers", "all-time-favorites", "historical-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1679746710", "review_id": "1679746710", "date": "Jun 26, 2016", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Kevin Ansbro", "user_url": "/user/show/43579369-kevin-ansbro", "text": "\n\"HERE IS A SMALL FACTyou are going to die.\"\nStating the blindingly obvious is our supernatural narrator, none other than Death himself, aka The grim Reaper (an innovative gambit that doesn't quite work, in my opinion).Almost a book for older children, The Book Thief can also be appreciated by adults.That said, the jejeune innocence of the book, given that some of the characters' lives are imperiled by Nazi oppression, did begin to niggle after a while.Liedel, the young book thief in question, discovers that the reading of illicit novels empowers her in a way that enchants and delights her.But a whitewashed copy of Mein Kampf, and the fact that Hitler was also an avid reader, provide proof that books are not always the beneficial influence we customarily believe.

And more importantly, a true book.I\u2019m a massive WW2 buff. Seriously, it\u2019s one of the few topics I can talk about at a dinner party with any degree of expertise. If you want to have a drunken two hour argument about how the Italians are the only reason the entirety of Europe isn\u2019t speaking German right now, I\u2019m your guy. Pre-war Germany fascinates and absolutely terrifies me \u2013 the slow disintegration of morality, the channelling of the basest of human instinct and emotion, the way an entire nation\u2019s depression and rage and hate was shackled by a handful of madmen and turned into the most fearsome war machine the world had yet seen. I watch the 1939 parades before the Brandenburg gate \u2013 this entire country armed and gleaming and about to plunge the world into a conflict in which 70 million people died. Young men with jaws you could break sledgehammers on, shiny jackboots marching into Paris and Warsaw and Vienna. And I wonder what the fuck they were thinking. What was going through their minds at that moment. If they had any idea what was coming.The Book Thief shows us the lives of the \u201cenemy\u201d. A poor German family struggling through the closing days of the war. The blinding victories of 40 and 41 are long gone. The crushing defeat at Stalingrad that signalled the deathknell to German ambition is on the horizon. And we\u2019re invited into the lives of a small family of German citizens. Ordinary people. Not SS troopers or party members or concentration camp guards. Tiny people with tiny lives, caught up in the huge machine they have no real control over, and no way to stop. And still, each of them rebels in their own tiny way, through their own tiny sense of rightness, through the notion of a promise, or love, or some innate sense that the madness their country has descended into is, in every fundamental way, absolutely abhorrent. They can\u2019t really change the world. The world is too far gone. And yet, each of them fight in their own tiny ways. With a bowl of soup. A basement. A notebook and a pencil. Books.The Book Thief is a book about words, their power and their terror, the ability the move a nation or find and define oneself through them. Our narrator is Death itself (funny how I caught myself thinking of Death as a \u201che\u201d throughout most of the book \u2013 I wonder if other folks did too) and the device is a bold one. We see the story through it\u2019s (mostly) impartial eyes. There\u2019s no real judgement of the actions of anyone in the book, no bony fingers are pointed, no blame assigned, more just a dusty bewilderment at the things humans do and why we do them. But humanity itself is judged over the course of the narrative, and hard questions are asked of you, the reader, if you want to really look for them. Liesel. Ah, Liesel. I haven\u2019t loved a character like I loved her in a long time. Fierce and gentle, in love with the world and at war with it. Trying to find herself as everything around her slowly erodes. She\u2019s a wonderful, beautiful character. Some of her words will stay with me for the rest of my life. Hans and Rosa. Rudy and Max. There were some great characters and brilliant moments. It\u2019s a wonderful read and the best book I\u2019ve read in a while.So why aren\u2019t I giving it 5 stars?Two reasons:I think I understand why Zusak did it, but Death drops some massive MASSIVE fucking spoilers on the way through the book. Death isn\u2019t human - I understand it doesn\u2019t really understand the need for suspense, doesn\u2019t really get the way humans think. It think the notion of having our narrator casually mention how the book will end four or five times over the course of the story totally works to cement it as a character in our heads, every bit as real as Leisel or Rudy. But I don\u2019t like spoilers. I think the climax of the book would have had far more impact if we\u2019d only been given a hint that it was coming. Particularly the end of Rudy and Leisel\u2019s story \u2013 I'm certain I would have blubbed like a baby if I hadn't been told by the narrator himself what was coming, in no small amount of detail, at least half a book before it actually happened. Second \u2013 some of the language just didn\u2019t work for me. I realise this is a purely subjective thing. I\u2019m not a huge fan of \u201cliterary fiction\u201d and I thought the Book Thief avoided the kind of navel-gazing word-wankery most \u201cliterature\u201d falls into. But sometimes\u2026 sometimes the metaphors and similes and word plays just didn\u2019t work. I didn\u2019t just see the narrator, I saw the author behind it, and they\u2019d rip me right out of the story. I\u2019d find myself sitting there looking at a turn of phrase like \u201ca breakfast colored sky\u201d and just stop dead and think \u201cWhat the hell color is breakfast? My weet bix are like, cardboard brown. Is that what he means? Is there something deeper in here? Is breakfast a metaphor for\u2026. Oh, no wait. I get it. It\u2019s just wankery\u2026\u201dAgain, point #2 is purely subjective. Some people like wondering what the color of breakfast is. Some people might find universal truth in their bowl of Weeties. Each to their own.But yes, it\u2019s a wonderful book. Thought-provoking and beautiful and sad.

I am unaware of when/with who this interview occurred, just that his answers are found in the back of the edition I own.)Very inventive and powerful story. It may have been a little over-hyped for me, as it didn\u2019t stun me and change my life the way these glowing reviews indicate\u2026 but definitely a strong, worth-while read. Pros:This is one of the most unique and creative books I've ever read. Though I\u2019ve read my fair share of historical fiction, I can say with certainty I\u2019ve never read anything like this. I added the quote above rather than one of the great lines in this story, because I think it really summarizes the most unique quality of book. The characterization of Death was ever present in his narrative (namely his fascination with colors and short dependent clauses) and it was fantastic, inventive and elevated this book to a different level. Aside from the narrative itself, the text really wrestles with some complex ideas and themes. Most WWII historical fictions I\u2019ve read spend time romanticizing the fragility of life or the futility of it all. While I do think these themes were present (it is war) I think the story actually managed to go beyond that. For instance: -\tTo me there was a really strong theme regarding the varying meanings of violence. From Liesel getting into fights in the school yard, Max\u2019s history of fistfights, the Nazi party\u2019s atrocious actions and Han\u2019s striking Liesel. The motivations of all these different actions were complex, varied and contrasted wonderfully together. -\tA beautiful theme about the power of words. This included the power one has in regards to telling your own story. -\tThe \u2018irrelevance\u2019 of outside appearances. I saw this mainly with Rudy (who appears the Nazi ideal) and his fascination with Jesse Owens. Cons: My main problem was that I really struggled to connect to most of the characters. (especially Liesel) This is why I feel this book may have been over-hyped for me, or that maybe I expected too much. I understand these characters really resonated with a lot of readers, but they just didn\u2019t with me. To me it felt more like the characters were tools being used to discuss these themes and ideas. All the characters had interesting things happen to them or did interesting things, but so much of their personality and reasoning was overshadowed by Death\u2019s narration. I think this was my personal reaction to the story, and can see where others would not share my opinion.In Conclusion: While I didn\u2019t connect with this as intensely as others, I think it discusses some complicated ideas and I fully expect it to be taught in Freshmen Lit classes one day.", "num_likes": 49, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["broke-my-heart-in-the-good-way", "recommended-to-me", "days-of-old-aka-historical-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/157869539", "review_id": "157869539", "date": "Mar 31, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Asha Seth", "user_url": "/user/show/5040094-asha-seth", "text": "This is going to be one long but endearing review. But I do hope you read it till the end because it did take serious struggle of the heart and mind to review this one right, and not let my affectionate feelings for this book get in the way. I swear I\u2019ve tried!Let\u2019s begin, shall we?There is no one way to review Zusak\u2019s masterpiece of a novel, and yet no matter which way I look, every angle looks right to me. This is the story of Liesel Meminger when she first arrives at her foster parents\u2019 house in Munich, in Nazi Germany. She has suffered a great loss; the aftermath of which will haunt her for years to come. She has also, for the first time, encountered death, but she doesn\u2019t know about it. And she is up yet for the most adventurous upbringing under Hubermann\u2019s roof, expecially with Hanz, her foster father.SettingSet in Nazi Germany, rooted in World War 2, the unrest arising from Hitler\u2019s \u2018Hate Jews\u2019 campaigns is dominant throughout. The cruelty, detention, concentration camps, deaths, uncertainty, mental and psychological suffering, longing for freedom, urge to revolt, suppressed furore, are all rampant throughout the pages of The Book Thief. Married with the impressive writing style, one can easily see through history and feel Nazi Germany and the fuhrer\u2019s reign coming alive in its pages.NarratorThe love to steer clear of everything redundant is quite aesthetically achieved by the author by making a loveable character out of a non-human narrator; one loathed, also possibly feared, by all humanity. Death plays a categorical role in putting the pieces together for this book, tying its ends namely pre-war period and the post-war one in Nazi Germany, the birth-ground of our book. It is worth a mention how death can be someone vulnerable, not scary but scared, lost, and overcome with human emotions of love and hate alike us mortals. That spin on death\u2019s disposition stood out for me, and restored my faith that genuinely gripping works might be few and far between, but not totally extinct.CharactersSpeaking of characters, you\u2019ll come across many but within the first 50 pages, you know who is going to stay with you until the end. Liesel\u2019s foster parents are worlds apart and yet balance out each other spectacularly under the strained times. Their tenderness outshines anything I am yet to come across in the literary world, although Molly Weasley from Harry Potter gets real close to Roza Hubermann\u2019s character.Hanz Hubermann is a loving fatherly figure; his devotion to Leisel is overwhelming and moving, to say the least. Very early after Leisel arrives, he finds out about her love for books and book-thieving acts but never does he condemn her. If anything, he ensures she learns to read, and grow her love for books, which as one will see is hardly satiable and would make her THE BOOK THIEF. The head Hubermann is an endearing character for there is much to learn from him. He is someone who would not think twice before putting his life on the line for his loved ones. A savaging yet saluting decision of hiding a Jew in your basement in Nazi Germany is everyone\u2019s cup of tea, you think? Within no time, he stole my heart and stepped up the ladder to become my most favorite character in Himmel Street.Liesel, our girl, is bold, vivacious, earthly, and impulsive. She is everything a 13-year-old is. But through the plot, she grows from being a nervous, uncertain, grieving girl, to a wonderful young woman. Her character; as depicted through death\u2019s eyes is motivating, and she comes to be the character death personally admires. Apart from these two, Roza Hubermann, Max Vanderburg (the Jew hiding in Hubermann basement) and Rudy Steiner (Liesel\u2019s schoolmate) are the other characters who have noteworthy contribution to the story and ones the book couldn\u2019t do without. They add substantial depth to Liesel\u2019s story and persona.Writing StyleThe writing style is very poetic in approach and the personification factor adds more beauty to the reading experience. Despite the proximity to war and cruelty, the dark theme of the prose exudes oodles of optimism; instead of making one feel depressed. The feelings of unrest and strain live with you only so long and soon you find yourself smiling at some act of courageous vivacity by Liesel or Rudy or Hanz.This book is a book within a book within a book for all its myriad flavors that wont leave you quenched even at the end of nigh 600 pages. More than the flabbergasting prose style, it is the dormant theme that will shoutout to you for listening in carefully, giving your undivided attention, so that nothing goes amiss. The writing is brimming with brilliance, speaking tonnes of the peculiar flair only a real prodigy can attempt. But that comes from eons of mental ache, from obvious trials and tribulations, resulting in a worded gem that not only demands but deserves patience, perseverance, and also passion to fully appreciate the outcome.In a nutshellThe Book Thief is about many things. It is about every emotion ever known to man \u2013 love, kindness, fear, lust, hatred, rage, and you can throw in some more. But what the book stands out for is freedom in difficult times. This book is no more Liesel\u2019s story than it is about the Hubermanns, Max, Rudy, or death himself. But more than anything, this book is about fights \u2013 fighting for survival, fighting for freedom, fighting for the right, fighting for your loved ones. And yet, that\u2019s not all.After drafting this review, I asked myself, how is it there isn\u2019t one thing I felt amiss and I said to myself, not all books have flaws.

Yes, I fell in love with The Book Thief! I really wish I'd read this book when it first came out, because The Book Thief is utter perfection, it's beautiful, emotional, cathartic and completely enthralling. I have never read story about Nazi Germany and death with so much heart, intelligence, humour and captivating prose until I read The Book Thief.From the beginning, I knew a book set in Nazi Germany with death as the narrator was going to be an emotional read. So I prepared my defences, but I wasn't prepared to laugh out loud at Liesal\u2019s adventures and her thoughts (especially concerning Rudy) and laughed even harder at Liesel's new mama, Rosa Hubermann. The woman had boundless energy, a big heart hidden under an abrasive personality and propensity for swearing at every opportunity that was oddly endearing. I loved the crazy woman, she was real and human in a way many female characters are not. Liesel's new papa, Hans Hubermann won me over, he was a patient, sweet and gentle loving soul. It's so easy to love a character like Hans. How Rosa and Hans manage to make their marriage work boggles the mind but it's also comedic gold, especially when you add Liesel into the mix. \"Some days, Pap told her to go back to bed and wait a minute, and he would return with his acordion and play for her. Liesel would sit up and hum, her cold toes clenched in excitement. No-one had ever given her music before. She would grin herself stupid, watching the lines drawing themselves down to his face, and the soft metal of his eyes - until the swearing arrived from the kitchen. 'STOP THAT NOISE, SAUKERL!'Papa would play a littler longer.He would wink at the girl and, clumsily, she'd wink back.\"The Book Thief had every thing, there was fierce beauty, friendship, respect, admiration, loyalty and love blossoming between several different characters-I became attached to them all, their personal struggles and human failings made these characters come live, it made them relatable. Still, Liesel Meminger and Rudy Steiner's escapades and their emotional bond eclipsed every other relationship in the book. I don't think I've ever been so deeply invested in a kiss, the subject has never made me laugh and grin as it did in The Book Thief. Markus Zusak managed to portray a believable friendship/love story that captures the imagination where many romance writers tried to do the same but failed miserably. This book surprised me at every turn but death was the biggest surprise of all, I didn't expect him to have a wry sense of humour but it struck the right tone for the book. The prose and tone used to express death's POV was perfect in a way that is truly inspired! Most of all, I didn't expect this book to leave me grinning, smiling and to find the premise, characters and narrative completely irresistible. Every now and then, I'd pause my audiobook and ask myself, 'how can a book narrated by death be so full of life and colour? How can a book set in Nazi Germany, a time when humanity showed its ugliness, be so full of beauty and heart?' The Book Thief does show the ugly side of life, but the evils of Nazi Germany are balanced out by Liesel, Rudy and the everyday drama of life on Himmell (heaven) Street and all of this is framed by death's asides and musings:  \u201cSo much good, so much evil. Just add water.\u201d I have listened to many audibooks but this one is the best yet, Allan Corduner (a fellow Brit) is a genius narrator with masterful grasp of subtle nuances in character, situations and accents. His ability to impersonate different characters to perfection, whether they are boys, girls, women, men, protagonists, antagonists or even death himself, is simply impressive! His pronunciation difficult German words with the right amount of passion and emphasis, is entertaining. In fact, I enjoyed the audiobook so much that I listened to it twice! Markus Zusak and Allan Corduner are a dream team, they've made the words come alive for me, at times I even forgot I was listening to n audiobook. This book was intense, devastating and uplifting but what the book thief did so well is to show beauty in everyday gestures, it showed that love, friendship, understanding and humanity can thrive in the most unlikely of places. And most surprising of all, \u201cEven death has a heart.\u201d ", "num_likes": 41, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["5-star-reads", "repeat-read", "ya", "dominant-ladies", "audiobooks", "favourite-books", "big-books", "award-winner", "best-side-characters", "family-relationships"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4411476245", "review_id": "4411476245", "date": "Dec 26, 2021", "rating": "", "user_name": "talia \u2661", "user_url": "/user/show/93624337-talia", "text": "i know this is a call for self-destruction but i think it's time for a reread...", "num_likes": 41, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["historical-fiction", "ya-lit", "books-about-books", "beautiful-writing-prose-etc", "owned", "owned-multiple", "crying-club", "comfort-reads", "books-that-changed-me", "favourites-of-all-time"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3030694615", "review_id": "3030694615", "date": "Mar 19, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Azet", "user_url": "/user/show/42316620-azet", "text": "\"When Death has a story to tell, you listen.\"\"The Book Thief\" is a book i have heard about ever since i started reading books but never came around to actually reading.

It is about a young German girl named Liesel who right at the beggining of the book experiences her brother passing away in her arms, and is later adopted by two foster parents named Rosa and Hans Hubermann. It tells the experience about Hitler and the Jews when Liesel and her family hides a Jew named Max and Liesel and him form a close bond.

There was a LOT happening in this book, and at the moment I'm too tired to recount all 550 (about) pages of events so...When I first started reading this book, I absolutely hated it. I disagreed with all the various praise that it recieved, and was tempted to stop reading it all together. Not until the rising action did I realize that this book was more like an experimental fiction sort of book than a classic historical fiction novel. Later on I grew quite attached to the characters, and the really saddening event that occurs quite late in the book made my heart ache.

That The Book Thief stole my breath away?That it crushed my heart into pieces?That it made me wonder so much about the world we live in?The Book Thief did more than that. You know, there are some books that you would always like to say that you've got no words to express it. But you always find the words. You just like to think that you don't. And I want to say that I have no words to express this beauty but I do. Deep down, I do have words to describe this wonderful book that made me wonder about the world we live in.  The Book Thief is a stroke of brilliance by Death  Death, here is our very lovely narrator. So, the aforementioned statement, according to me, means that we always consider Death as a bad thing, of course it is only natural. But the Book Thief changed some of my perspectives about Death (Not that I'd welcome him with open arms). Death is truly an amazing narrator and his stroke of brilliance, probably the only one on Earth is his narration.   \u201cEven death has a heart.\u201d  Oh, Death stole me away in his very first words.  First the coloursThen the humansThat's usually how I see things.Or at least, how I try. The book itself has this warm glow about it that reminds me of biscuits and milk. If I were an aura reader and this book was a living being, then I could precisely describe it's glow and warmth. Unfortunately, I'm not. While reading this book, somewhere in the middle, I paused to think about freedom. What does freedom taste like?Freedom tastes like fresh air. That was my immediate thought. You know, I wish I could feel and taste freedom. I wish it for all of us. We're not exactly free, you know. We are bound in one way or the other. And I guess, sweet Liesel felt the same though she never mentioned anything about it but I'd like to think she did feel something about being free. Being free from war and loss. I really do love books that evoke the strangest thoughts from me. One minute I'm serene and deep inside the philosophical parts of my mind and the next I'm back to my goofy self again. Strange, I know. All these things happened while reading this masterpiece.   Never leave the books you're reading!:  So, I went jet skiing in an island and they let me drive for some time. I pushed the accelerator to maximum and that was when I tasted freedom. I felt like freedom was within my reach. Now, don't ask me why I'm so into freedom. It's not like we're trapped, I know. Ask this book why it elicited these thoughts from me. After finishing my drive, I remembered the book thief and smiled. That's when I realized what a bloody brilliant book this is and what a bloody idiot I was to leave it behind. Okay books, I learnt my lesson!  Sometimes, you need to feel and see things to understand the words you read. So, my first reaction when I came back home was to cradle this book and draw circles on the cover with my finger. Admire the cover and its softness and procrastinate about what is going to happen. Then delve into its mysteries and in the end, force myself not to shed tears.Let's conclude this ruminative review of mine with a small letter addressed to our beloved Book Thief.    A small letter to the Book Thief  Dear Book Thief,You have written the most amazing book which was narrated by Death, our dear - old - friend - in - the - end. Here's a small secret: I have tons of books at home and I'll leave the windows open for you. You're always welcome to my humble abode of books. P.S I'm leaving extra biscuits for Rudy :)  Yours lovingly, Hershey.

It was so captivating and beautifully written. I don\u2019t usually like to read historical fiction. I chose to read this book because of it\u2019s many good reviews and thank God I read it or I\u2019d miss something so wonderful.The story is about a girl called Liesel Meminger who lived in a small place called The Himmel Street (Himmel: Heaven). She was adopted by Hans and Rosa Hubermann after her brother\u2019s death. She\u2019s the one who then known as the book thief (though I would not call most of her actions \u2018thievery\u2019). When she took her first books, she couldn\u2019t even read. Her friends bullied her and her teachers beat her because she was slow to read. So why stealing books? Because the first book she stole (during her brother\u2019s funeral) reminded her of the last time she saw her real brother and mother. Later she loved to read because of her foster father who lovingly and patiently taught her to read. Everyday she hang out with her best friend, Rudy Steiner, and other kids in the neighborhood. They liked to steal from richer houses but while her friends stole foods, Liesel loved to steal books.One day, on Hitler\u2019s birthday celebration where the F\u00fchrer (F\u00fchrer: Leader) burn a lot of \u2018offensive\u2019 stuff including a lot of books, a book survived and Liesel couldn\u2019t help but to take it home. The book was about a good Jew. It changed Liesel and papa\u2019s (her foster father) mind of Jews and Nazis so when Max Vandenburg a young Jew, came to their house, seeking shelter, they welcomed him. Liesel became friend with Max since they both enjoyed reading books. But as the war started and the Nazis hunted down Jews all over the place, the little Himmel Street was no longer safe especially with Max hiding in the Hubermann\u2019s basement. And Liesel came to realize the power of words and wrote a book that would latter found by the narrator and told to us through this book.I love the writing style of this book. The flow of the story was so enjoyable. There\u2019s quite a lot of German words used here. For example they use Herr and Frau instead of Mr. and Mrs. and the nicknames and swearing too but there\u2019s translations between the texts so it\u2019s not a problem for readers who don\u2019t speak German (I\u2019m one of them :p). This is the first book I read with Death as the narrator (I imagined something like a grim reaper who hovers over dead people). Like the narrator, I want to ask Markus Zusak this:I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant.The story was beautiful and terrible at the same time since it tells of the ugly truth of what a war could bring to a sweet innocent girl like Liesel and the ending was so sad that I still cried even though I had already know how it would end (the narrator sometimes gave spoilers on how things would end or who would die before it happened. Strange, but it still very enjoyable to read). The story of Liesel Meminger is so captivating that it even distract Death. A LAST NOTE FROM YOUR NARRATORI am haunted by humans.It mainly a story of friendship, family, courage and kindness. And books. Very recommended especially for those who enjoy historical fiction. :D", "num_likes": 39, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1358760152", "review_id": "1358760152", "date": "Jul 26, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Vanessa", "user_url": "/user/show/25545124-vanessa", "text": "Damn...this book snuck up on me.

She was 9 years old when her younger brother died in the train. They left the train to bury the boy in the nearby town. She picked up the book which fell from the grave diggers pocket and took the next train to Munich where she was given away to a foster family on the Himmel Street. Altogether Leisel owned 10 books, out of which 6 were stolen, 1 showed up at the kitchen table, 2 were made for her by a hidden Jew and 1 was delivered. Her real father was a communist but she didn't knew much about him, while her mother was always sick hence she left her with the foster family of Hubermanns. Her foster mother Rosa was always furious whereas Hans, her foster father was very gentle and kind towards her. Hans was a musician and a painter, Rosa ironed and washed other people's clothes. Rudy and Leisel became best friends, went to school together and even played soccer in the street with other kids. Leisel used to hide the books under her bed but one day Hans found the book while changing the bed sheet. Then together they started reading the book; Hans also taught her how to read and write. During the World War II she wrote letters to her real mother but never got any response. Hans and Rosa had two of their own children, who lived away for work but visited on holidays. Hans didn't like the Nazis but his son liked them so they always argued over it. One day Hans' son left the house and never came back. Hans was part of the platoon in World War I and he was the only one who survived because his friend Erik nominated him to write letters while they fought. Erik also taught him how to play the accordion. From that onwards Hans decided to leave the Nazi party because he was saved by a Jew and some of his loyal customers were also Jews. He left his number with Erik's wife in case they ever needed any help. Max, Erik's son came to Hans' house for help. Max gave Leisel a book on her birthday which he drew and wrote himself.Leisel and Max both were Jews and shared nightmares as common, she dreamed of her dead bother and the train, while he dreamt of his family when he left them. Rosa was left with no work as everyone pulled out because of the war. Nazi men came to inspect their basement to consider it as a shelter later on, Max stayed hidden and they were safe for now. Hans got more and more of painting work as people became vary of the war and its consequences. Leisel went with him pushing the paint cart, those were some of the best days of her life. They all went to a shelter after the sirens went out. Hans tried to give a piece of bread to an old Jew who was part of the procession which resulted in him being beaten by the soldiers. Everyone called him a lover of Jews which terrified him as he realised his mistake and knew something terrible would happen to him and Max as well. Max was gone that night and Hans blamed himself for it. Hans was ordered to fight for Hilter and so was Rudy's father as he refused to give his son to the army. Germans were losing in Russia so they needed more men to fight for them. Max wrote another book for Leisel. Leisel turned 14 when Hans returned from the war after he factured his leg during an accident. Later bombs fell on the Himmel Street, everyone died except Leisel as she was in the basement reading the story of her own life, which she herself wrote. Leisel found Max in one of the Jews procession, met him and was beaten by the soldier for it. Rudy saved her from the soldier and she told him everything about Max. Max returned after the war and met with Leisel. Leisel died old in Syndey. The book was narrated by the Reaper who also took Leisel's book and kept it with him for all those years.

There are lots of tears shed onto my book right now.I loved Liesel, like so much. She was such an angel and forever sweet to people. Her friendship with Rudy was my absolute favorite thing ever. It killed me when he died. Then the way that she stole books, or really borrowed books from the mayor's wife. It just made me smile so much. Then the way that she took care of Max when he was in the coma. Building a snowman, reading books to him, and bringing gifts from the outside world were just way too sweet. Then the epilogue - which I absolutely loved! LOVED PEOPLE. Especially when it was mentioned that death was haunted by humans. Overall, I loved this book (if you couldn't already tell) and I'm one hundred percent obsessed with it. I really want to rewatch this movie again. This book moved me. Made me cry.

I wanted to know why, so I read their reviews. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I don't think most of the criticisms I read held much weight. Of course what follows is only my opinion. This book is about Nazi Germany. It's not about the redemptive powers of literature. It's not about the redemptive powers of literature, but about the mesmerizing power of words. Words that can enlighten, confound, lie, offer solace, distraction, genocide or hope. Some of the devices used in the book are 'cutesy', and they can be a little silly to an adult reader. The weird list interjections, the fragments from a letter, or a definition from a dictionary do keep coming every few pages. They work to break up the episodic bits of the story, but more they serve to illustrate certain things that would be unwieldy if the author had to actually write them into the story. They are additional details that help give the feeling to the story, but as part of the narrative most often their addition into the main body of the text may not be welcome. They are also, for lack of a better word on my part, meta-fiction additions to the story. I'd be curious about the people who same to hate these intrusions, and accuse them to catering to the whims of kids raised on the internet what they think of someone like Kurt Vonnegut who uses these same kind of techniques in his works. Being a YA novel there were things that happened in the book that I overlooked. In an adult novel I might find some of the characters with their hearts of gold a little bit too cookie cutter, not fleshed out enough. But for the story purposes here they seemed find. The book was on the long side for kids anyway, fleshing out characters and adding moral ambiguities to the characters would have made it even longer. The book has enough of these ambiguities in the themes it works with. For a similar story with morally ambiguous characters with a true psychological depth, I'd recommend Europe Central by William Vollmann. My take on this whole novel is that it's about words and what they can do. For example the kind of annoying little dictionary entries work to show how the dictionary fails to capture all the meanings an innocent word can take on in the right moments. This isn't ground breaking stuff, but for a YA novel I think it's probably pretty radical. I mean were talking Adorno, \"How can there be Poetry after Auschwitz\" here, on a simpler scale, but still it's facing the problem of how to live in a world where this can happen, how to use words that can also be used to incite a civilized nation that has brought us Goethe to irrationally try to liquidate whole groups of people. How does the language that supposedly does the most poetic justice to Shakespeare also do this? I've gone on about this in other reviews, so I won't go much further on this tangent. But in a simpler way this book is dealing with one aspect of Adorno's famous quote, and wrestles with the same problems that poets like Celan and Bachmann spent their lives trying to deal with. As a story, it's a good read even without the theory stuff that I have read into it. It moves along nicely and like a great Vonnegut book it handles the juggling act between an engaging narrative, literary tricks, and a moral message with a relative ease that doesn't come across too forced.

Liesel's life becomes upheaval after the death of her brother, and having to live in the countryside with her new foster parents while the second world war continues. Although initially distraught, Liesel eventually makes an incredible adjustment to her new life with her foster family, and not only does she learn to be happy in her new environment, but she actually begins thrive in many areas of life, all while leaving a lasting mark on many of the people in her new village. This novel is told through a well written narrative by a grim-reaper-like figure that has extraordinary imagery and description. One of my reasons for not giving this book a five star rating is because there are a lot of poignant WWII tales out there, and I could be overly cynical when I say that I am not sure how I feel about people romanticizing one of the bleakest periods in history. However, I once heard that the purpose of art is to find beauty in the grotesque, so it could just be the case that I am tired of WWII tales, not because authors are doing anything tasteless. My other reason for not regarding this novel as perfect is due to the character of Liesel.

I loved it, I hated it, I lost sleep over it. I didn't know what to do with myself. In essence, it killed me in the best way possible. As per usual, I cried - although nothing with ever parallel the sobfest and subsequent book hangover (yes, they are a thing) that possessed me the first time I read this. Yep, that was me.The true power of this book lies in the narrative voice. Using Death's perspective could have gone so horrifically wrong. Audacious and dizzyingly ambitious, it was a risky idea. But oh my, did it deliver. Zusak nailed the voice. Most of us expect Death to be a sadistic sort of guy, but instead, Zusak made him tired and vulnerable. He's also unexpectedly funny, in a dark, enigmatic kind of way. The plot left to itself would still be emotionally compelling but not anywhere near as sublime if it were told in first or third person. Yes, the narrative voice is somewhat distanced. Perhaps you'd think that would render this book sterile, the characters soulless. I don't know what it is, but I've never fallen into a book in the way that I do with this one. The characterisation is superb and the novel as a whole is so exquisitely immersive. Every time I revisit this one, I'm overwhelmed anew by how utterly humane it is. There's just something about the way Death speaks that conveys the idea of being human in an extremely elemental way that's unlike anything I've ever come across. The prose is raw and truthful, verging on the queasily visceral. It makes me feel both cold and alive in a way that I can't describe.I'm grateful that I read this at what I see as the perfect point in my life. (Although I've always been older than my years, so please take this with a pinch of salt.) I was fourteen and just about to start studying for my GCSEs (these are the exams that you take at the end of high school), and, as I saw it, was embarking on something higher. It was the end of an era, almost - things were about to become more serious. I felt like I was really on the cusp of something. I was at that point where you start to glean a greater awareness of life as a whole rather than only seeing that little world of childhood trivialities. The Book Thief in many ways is a coming of age story. It documents the preteen years of a young girl who's forced to grow up far too quickly. And it opened my eyes. I especially think it's a very relevant novel in terms of the time period it concerns. There seems to be a bias in education here in the UK, or at least there definitely was when I was a child learning about WW2 for the first time when I was eight. Kids of my generation were taught primarily about the life of the British citizens during the war. We were taught about rationing, Anderson shelters, evacuees - mainly the repercussions for the children. I knew about how the war affected 'my side'. The Book Thief however challenged the view that I had been more or less indoctrinated to adopt: that the British were morally untouchable and every German malicious and evil. What they had neglected to tell us was the other side of the war. I hadn't considered the possibility of the violence working both ways.Until I was fourteen, I had no idea how Germany had suffered. In fact, I'm ashamed to say that it had never even crossed my mind. Essentially, the German citizens suffered much further than those of Britain or America had. I knew a lot about the Blitz, but was completely ignorant of how the Allies had also bombed Germany to bits - Dresden, Hamburg, Berlin, Munich. (Harris' carpet bombing sounds more like a biblical punishment than a military strategy.) And I don't know why they censored that. Again, I have The Book Thief to thank for giving me eyes.As I'm sure many of you will know, there was a movie adaptation that appeared back in 2013. Whilst it is worth a watch, I need to stress that it does not in any way do the book justice. Please don't substitute the movie for the original novel. The official trailer is also much more engaging than the actual movie itself which is something I'm still a little confused about. Regardless, I'm always taken aback by how brilliant an actress Sophie N\u00e9lisse is. And... Geoffrey Rush. No more needs to be said.I know so many people who are deliberately avoiding this book because it's a tear-jerker. (It's narrated by Death. During WW2. There will be casualties.) Please don't be put off.  Regardless of whether you think you will enjoy it or not, I strongly urge you to give this a try.

The end of the story is somewhat spoiled from the start with a flashforward (Death's fault), so you certainly can take time to brace for it. His presence does make the story lighter.It's quite heartwarming to read how Liesel's life at the Hubermann's goes, as she becomes more and more connected to them, learning a lot of things and gaining some memorable experiences. While food is scarcer, work even scarcerer, and life complicated due to Nazis, both foster parents are great people, treating her like family. Her friendship with Rudy is also useful, he's of great help when Liesel (view spoiler)[goes to steal books from mayor's house, and also in getting extra food through stealing - it's a bit of a shame that she can't tell him about Max until way later (hide spoiler)].There are many important figures in the book, but the arrival of Hans's (view spoiler)[friend's son, Max Vanderburg, makes things complicated in many ways (though if he had been found in their house, it would've been even worse for the Hubermanns). But through him, Liesel experiences many life lessons, and he gives her stories to read, more just-for-her than the other books. Love the reuse of Mein Kampf, it's what that the-worst book deserves! (hide spoiler)]This books says so much about reading, about life under a political power one doesn't like (and what variety in what the usual citizen would have about living under such one), ways to refuse, ways of death the people in this book experience - and one can think about just death (and Death) too.I do like that we get to know what sort of life Liesel led afterwards, though it's not in great detail. And since we're getting Death's viewpoint a lot, we also get to (view spoiler)[see him pick Liesel up, but only after she's lived a long, happy life; and then she gets her little notebook back *aww* (hide spoiler)]. So the ending is both sad and happy, though Death is obviously a bit shattered after so much connection to people (but at least he has many interesting people to meet).

It's the same story you've seen in films and in other books but through the eyes of Death itself, which at the same time tells the story of Liesel, the book thief, a young girl who grows up in this mess of a world. What I liked best is the symbolism used to tell us the story, how Death merges the colours with its own feelings and the souls it is taking away. And of course, the stolen books. With each one Liesel covers a new level, she grows wiser and offers love and comfort to the ones around her with her books, which she treats like real treasures.And then, the characters. All are likeable, even Death itself, it seems sorry to take so many lives away and specially in the last chapters it was impossible to hold tears any longer, at least in my case. Don't take me wrong though, the book isn't a dramatic account of tragic events to move the readers to tears, just the opposite. It's exactly the fairytalish and simple way to tell the story that moved me, such gentleness and atrocity mixed up together is impossible not to shake you.Rosa Hubermann, I liked her specially, without much fuss you can feel her rough love, steady and warm. I loved the scene when she goes to meet Liesel at the school to tell her about Matt's recovery.Rudy, the boy with the hair the colour of lemons, I find the last account devastating. And they never got to kiss each other. \"Jesus, Christ and Mary...\"Matt, the young jew, haunted by his nightmares and Liesel's best ally. They create their own world in the Hubermann's basement. I love the end of his story, at least there's some kind of happy end with their reunion. It's funny how the character who seemed the weakest was the one to survive the hell he lived.And, of course, Hans Hubermann, with his accordion, he's such a tender character ! Loving father, husband and a overall a good person. Always prepared to give comfort, to offer a hug, to spend endless nights on a chair next to his haunted foster daughter.I only hope to be as brave as Hans and Liesel when the time comes and Death comes to take my soul, that I'll be waiting sitting up and meeting its eyes without blinking.Death's reflexion at the end of the book:\" I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words so damning and brilliant.\"", "num_likes": 32, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["read-in-2011"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/73736385", "review_id": "73736385", "date": "Oct 07, 2009", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lance Greenfield", "user_url": "/user/show/2793431-lance-greenfield", "text": "Superb!Markus Zusak uses a very original style of writing for this story.

The poor guy is completely blocked out with his work; until eternity. Personally, I feel that I am far too busy to write a book, and I have a life of leisure relative to that of the old Grim Reaper!The book thief, Liesel Meminger, is fostered by the Hans and Rosa Hubermann in Molching, near Munich, during World War II. She interacts with much of the local community, and her best friend Rudy, who comically impersonates the great Jesse Owens and spends much of his time trying to steal a kiss from Liesel, features heavily. Apart from her foster family, the other main characters in Liesel\u2019s life include the Jewish fist-fighter, Max Vandenburg, who hides in the family\u2019s cellar, and the mayor\u2019s wife, Ilsa Hermann.Death reveals his character, and his lack of understanding of both his mission on Earth and the strange behaviour of the human race, through comments which are littered throughout the text. Some of these are very amusing, others are downright thought-provoking. We are told, early on, that Rudy will be tragically killed before the story is complete, but this takes nothing from the intensity of emotions that run through the reader\u2019s mind as the pages are turned. In fact, I would say that this knowledge probably increases the strength of feeling. As the title implies, Liesel steals books from time to time, and these become part of her chronicle.The only real gripe that I have with this book is that the publishers have tried to add realism to the inclusion of a hand-written short story, by illustrating it with ridiculously small and unreadable font. I struggled to read this enchanting section of the book with my fifty-four year old eyes peering through my reading glasses and a magnifying glass. I am sure that it was never the author\u2019s intention to distract me from this beautifully presented story with bad formatting, but the publishers have a lot to answer for.All said and done, I loved this book with its original style and its unique approach to relating the well-worn horrors of WWII.

It's filled with war, death, fear, grief.....but also deep love, friendship, understanding and beauty. To have light, there has to be darkness.

I'm hoping the movie sticks closely to the book....this tale is just about perfect just the way it is. I listened to the audiobook version of The Book Thief (Penguin Random House Audio). At just under 14 hours long, the story is narrated by Allan Corduner. Corduner gives a great performance, voicing and acting the different characters with great skill. I have partial hearing loss but was easily able to hear and understand this entire book. I think my favorite character is Rosa Hubermann. She seems so angry and gruff, but she is actually a very loving, kind person. She calls both Hans and Liesel pigs -- saukurl and saumensch -- all through the book. And Liesel and her best friend use those same terms for each other. The words end up endearments rather than curse words. Great book!

Death was the narrator and Leisel was the protagonist. Each chapter was only a few pages and the saddest story in history was often told with an air of amusement in the background.Leisel\u2019s story was both ordinary and profound, her childhood before coming to live with her adoptive parents was brutal but she was resilient and kept some innocence about her. I adored her papa, Hans, just as Leisel clearly did. Their bond and connection was beautiful to read. Her mama and papa took steps to support the Jews and this formed a significant part of the story.Trust was accumulated quickly, due primarily to the brute strength of the man\u2019s gentleness, his thereness.This story transported me to the context of a Germany under Nazi rule. More importantly, it transports the reader to an average Joe perspective, village life and an example of good German people just trying to survive the hideousness of war and the regime they were under. Told over decades, this was both a light-hearted and heavy and emotionally-laden tale.This isn\u2019t a 5 star read for me because the writing style was strange, I won\u2019t say that I ever got on with it, but I rubbed along with it because of the great story and characters.

I happened to read a review of this recently, and it reminded me there are some interesting interviews with Markus Zusak that might interest readers.

I don\u2019t know where to start with the Book Thief. The formatting, drawings and sketches? The language? The sense of place and time? The wonders and horrors? Overwhelming. I didn\u2019t so much read it as experience it as it unfolded. I kept lingering over passages that were too accurate, too sharp, too descriptive \u2013 too real. WW2 Germany. And then suddenly, kids would be joyfully playing football in the mud or stealing apples - normal, every-day children growing up in spite of The War.Death is a surprisingly compassionate narrator, interested in the contrast between innocence and evil. He (he is male) rescues the souls of soldiers in pain who welcome him. Then, with great tenderness, he regretfully lifts and carries away the souls of small children. Death tells a good story, moving from homely households with thin soups to the frozen, bloody battlefields of Russia. The language ranges from lyrical and \u2018literary\u2019 to idiomatic contemporary because Death has been everywhere forever and speaks for everyone. From the first pages:\u201cIt was the darkest moment before the dawn.This time I had come for a man of perhaps twenty-four years of age. It was a beautiful thing in some ways.

She falls in love with words and books, she roams and romps with friends, she befriends and is steadfastly loyal to a Jewish man being hidden in a small cellar. She steals a book now and then, hence her nickname.Death tells her story, backtracking and jumping forward, occasionally offering glimpses of the future, as when speaking of two brothers:\u201cSoon they would both be in the war. One would be making bullets. The other would be shooting them.\u201dAlthough I loved the characters, and many scenes were terribly sad, there seemed to be an overall understanding that everyone\u2019s time on earth is temporary, and Death will come for us all. After all, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to happen, and while he\u2019s happier collecting tired old souls, he seems to remember all of them, young and old, and reminds himself and us that our souls must go with him eventually, peacefully, we hope.

It was such a clever and unique concept having a book narrated by death, especially when the book is set in Nazi Germany. There were so many moving passages within this book that I regularly stopped to re-read passages and give thought to the authors words. For a book that was set in one of our history's worst periods with it's dreadful examples of human atrocities it was filled with beautiful and thought provoking words. One (of many) such passages was found on p422 in the chapter \"The Long Walk to Dachau\". The Jewish prisoners are being paraded and one elderly man is being whipped for the crime of accepting a slice of bread. Our narrator (death) relates it this way.\"When the elderly Jew climbed to his feet for the last time and continued on, he looked briefly back.... If nothing else, the old man would die like a human. Or at least with the thought that he was human. Me?I'm not so sure that's such a good thing\".I adored Leisl and her close realtionship with Hans Hubermann, her step father (Papa). He was such a beautiful man and through his words and actions he taught her the most valuable lessons in life. Though fiction it gave me an appreciation for the difficulties that must have been experienced by those Germans with compassion towards the Jewish people. How difficult life could become if one did not subscribe to the Nazi party's ways. The courage it must have taken to put ones own life at risk to protect and conceal Jews and the sacrifices that were required to keep the secret. I particularly delighted in Leisl's closest friendships. Firstly with her childhood friend and partner in crime Rudy, and possibly more importantly the wonderful friendship she and Max Vandenbug developed through the sharing of stories and nightmares.This book was a completely different but no less emotional way of being reminded of the heartbreak and loss experienced by so many during this terrible part of our recent human history. When I think of the holocaust I cant help but be reminded of (and agree with) the last words of our narrator. \"I am haunted by humans\".

The Book Thief is one of these books. After 'the fault in our stars' I didn't think I would cry so much reading a character's story but this novel proved me wrong. Crying is an understatement, more like my whole being is in agony, pain, happiness and ecstasy. As many things I will write about it, they will not be enough, worlds are simply not enough. I want to say so many things but I am afraid I will leave important things out.

Let's just say that this book is the mother of all these books, the one book to rule them all. First of all how did the author came up with the idea of death narrating the whole thing? It's marvelous, magnificent, GENIUS. Second of all you can't help but admire Liesel, feel the things she feels and understand why she does the things she does and that's why everybody loves her, her papa, mama, Rudy, Max, the mayor's wife. The way Markus wrote the book, the metaphors he used, the visions he tried to create, the simplicity in which he tried to convey his message, all these things end up to one thing, a masterpiece.

I guess that I had always assumed that the camps were in secret locations far from the prying eyes of regular Germans...because if they had known what was happening, surely they would have protested, right? The Book Thief showed me that it was a lot more complicated than that for the average German citizen - their livelihood and survival also hinged on their complete support of Hitler and any dissension was labeled as unpatriotic and quickly dealt with harshly.The Book Thief is a beautiful story about an 11-year-old German orphan named Liesel that goes to live with a poor foster family, the Hubermanns, near Munich. She learns to read under their care and begins stealing books - first from a graveyard, then a book burning and others from a rich family in town. The books are powerful characters themselves, bringing solace to herself and others, contrasting against the destruction that Mein Kampf has also wrought during this time. The Hubermanns hide a Jew in their basement to whom Liesel becomes close. Jews are marched through the streets of Liesel's town - \"They were going to Dachau to concentrate.\" Town members begin rebelling in their small ways. One father refuses to let his son go the Hitler's school for elite youth which results in his enlistment in the German army. Liesel's foster father gives some bread to a dying Jew on a march which sets off a disastrous path of events that affects everyone in the family, including their hidden Jew in the basement.Much of the story centers around life in the town. As the war continues, food and work are harder to come by and most are grieving the loss of family through war fatalities. I appreciated the book's ability to show that the German people suffered too. As WWII comes to Germany, Liesel's neighborhood meets repeatedly in a basement to wait out the Allied bomb strikes. These are terrifying evenings, calmed only by her readings, but the narrator wryly notes that \"The Germans in basements were pitiable, surely, but at least they had a chance. That basement was not a washroom. They were not sent there for a shower. For those people, life was still achievable.\"Death narrates the story, but he isn't a frightening narrator, rather a tired, over-worked one in these Hitler times and it's his take on the human race that is the most poignant. Here are some of my favorite passages.\"They say that war is death's best friend, but I must offer you a different point of view on that one. To me, war is like the new boss who expects the impossible. He stands over your shoulder repeating one thing, incessantly: 'Get it done, get it done.' So you work harder. You get the job done. The boss, however does not thank you. He asks for more.\"\"I've seen so many young men over the years who think they're running at other young men. They are not. They're running at me.\"\"I guess humans like to watch a little destruction. Sand castles, houses of cards, that's where they begin.

This isn't the first book I've read featuring Death as a narrator, but it might be the first book where I've wondered why this particular narrator was chosen. Well, at least I wondered at first.  Of course, it all made sense in the end. But there was a period of time when I was not so thrilled with Death's voice. You see, his point of view was all over the place. I don't do so well with books which jump around as much as this one did. I wanted the focus to stay more with Liesl (the young girl who Death attaches himself to) because the world was made vivid through her interactions with others. However, when the story got to Max - lovely, downtrodden, feather-haired (just the texture, he wasn't actually the person who came up with the horrific feathered hairstyle) Max - I forgot about Death and immersed myself in the story. This isn't exactly the same vibe as The Diary of Anne Frank, but a big portion of Liesl's story revolved around her interactions with Max, the young man who was taken in by Liesl's family and forced to hide in their basement from the Nazis.\n\nHow do you give someone a piece of the sky?\n\nThe first 2/3 of the book = here and there. There were some great scenes and interactions (loved the relationship between Liesl and her Papa the most, which surprised me), and a bunch of facts and side stories because DEATH IS A RAMBLER. Yes, I said it. I wouldn't want Death at any dinner parties of mine (not that I throw many snooty dinner parties anyway). He'd annoy me. The last 1/3 of the book = my heart was used and abused. Today was a day to be thankful for not putting makeup on because the tears were flowing.  The Book Thief had a 5 star ending, with mixed scenes ranging from 2 to 4 stars for the rest of the book, which is why I have sort of a middling rating. Make no mistake though.

Though each of them is merely a cover and pieces of paper, the author has filled it with words that make it unique and the reader has only vague ideas of what might be coming in the hours of reading ahead. This book has been haunting me for years. I attempted to read it several times and ended up just putting it down but since my new book club picked it for our first meeting, I was somewhat obligated to finish it. I'm extremely glad I did.This novel, narrated by Death itself, tells the story of a young German girl, Liesel Meiminger, growing up during the Holocaust/WWII era. She starts her life with her mother and brother and we follow her journey as a foster child in a small town outside Munich. Though this book is labeled young adult, for reasons completely unknown to me (perhaps merely the fact that Liesel is a child?), I definitely enjoyed it as literature. Then again, you'd never hear me utter a blasphemous word about the young adult genre--as it stands, I find myself reading about 70% young adult literature these days. I guess the point I am trying (horribly) to make here is that it saddens me that perhaps less people will have easy access or hear of this book (or the many, many other AMAZING young adult books) because of marketing and chosen publishing audiences.The narration of this book took a little getting used to, but once I was with the program, I found Death's asides to be some of my favorite parts of the book. He (she?) filled me in with those details that might be left hanging in other books. Death also left a lot of vivid imagery for my imagination, though Liesel and Max's relationship was what brought me the most pleasure from this story. I found the descriptions of the clouds lovely and the thought of the brightness of the stars blinding Max was rather poignant. It was definitely interesting reading a story from the German aspect of WWII. Though I am doubtful that any story relating to the atrocities of the Holocaust can actually be termed \"accessible,\" I thought Zusak did a great job of describing what one girl's life during that period could've encompassed. I loved her friendship with Rudy and the characters in the neighborhood were perfect--every neighborhood has people like each of them. The most meaningful part of this book to me was the way it nailed the wonders of being a reader. Mark Twain once said, \"The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them.\" Liesel was on a mission to learn to read and her journey of learning and then of actually reading certain stories defined a lot of her experiences. Reading is powerful, just look at how much influence Hitler had with Mein Kampf. (sorry to state the obvious) Not a day goes by that I don't think of at least one idea from a book I've read or about what I want to read next. There is an unlimited supply of adventures out there for those that are looking for something--I'm only saddened by the fact that more people don't realize what they are missing.", "num_likes": 29, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["miadb-picks", "seattle-book-club-picks", "favorites", "aussie-ya-is-the-cats-meow", "young-adult-teen", "read-in-2010"]}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/285608072", "review_id": "285608072", "date": "Feb 28, 2012", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Licha", "user_url": "/user/show/5614272-licha", "text": "I was not going to give this book five stars because I absolutely hated who the narrator was. But in the end, the story was just too strong for me to deny that this book touched me deeply and the characters will live with me forever. I loved that this story of the Holocaust was told through the story of a young girl, Liesel and the people in her life.I will start by saying that I did not care for the narrator being the Grim Reaper/Death. It would at times take me out of the story because I'd have to have an inner debate about whether I thought Death would act/think the way it did in certain situations. I felt like the story stepped outside of itself when Death would have to explain how hard he worked during those years. It's not anything we don't already know. Another thing that really bothered me about Death being the narrator were the spoilers. My goodness, I was just so angry when he revelaed what was going to happen to certain people and the worst when he revealed what the outcome of \"the kiss\" was going to be. I avoided reading reviews on this book prior to reading it, but no worries, the author decides to reveal key elements of the story for you with the excuse that Death didn't want to be bothered with holding a little mystery. I found it quite unfair of the author to commit these underhanded spoilers.That being said, I loved this story. The author did a great job of putting me in that exact place and time. I fell in love with Liesel. I fell in love with Rudy, with his eternal question to Liesel of \"Can I have a kiss, Saumensch\". If all of us could ever be so lucky as to have this kind of puppy love and loyalty and friendship. I felt Liesel's response to Rudy each time to be believable. I fell in love with Papa Hans Hubermann. I wish there were more people like him in the world and more people like him who could take in a foster child and love them as their own. I believed Liesel's immediate attachment to him to be believable. I loved Max and what he brought out in Liesel, Hans and Rosa. I couldn't believe how his book \"The Standover Man\" made me cry. I even loved Rosa, who despite her bad temper and foul mouth, it was evident how much she loved Liesel and her husband. And they loved her back too. A whole group of people who didn't necessarily show their love in blatant ways, but yet the reader can feel how much they actually care about each other.This book made me think about the connection books have in our lives. I think all of us can always remember those special books in our lives and how they tied in to a particular time in our life. I could completely relate to Liesel and her strong attachment to books. Some of my favorite parts of the book were when she stole books because I felt like I would soon be sitting in the basement with Liesel and be listening to her read the book aloud.I was ready to give this book a four but by the end, this book and the characters won me over.

(Don't worry it's not a spoiler, it actually gets told that he will die before it even happens.

First of all: I am very tempted to call everyone saumensch now.Second of all: I loved this book because it's so raw and real. It's incredibly captivating because you know this shit happened. This shit actually happened which makes it all the more heartbreaking. There's no sugarcoating either which I appreciate a lot because it makes you realise once more how lucky we actually are. We being our present-day generation. The only thing I thought was weird was the fact that this story was narrated by death. I often forgot that and then thought I was reading from Liesel's POV which sometimes confused me. But then I remembered it was our big guy narrating it and not little Liesel. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. (see what I did there) can we talk about Rudy again tho?! How wonderful of a person was he actually???? Such a god damned darling and his friendship with Liesel was to die for. I melted. So beautiful. The whole book was beautiful and incredibly eye-opening. I am very interested in the second World War so I loved getting to know more about not only the suffering of the Jews but also the innocent German families who suffered from the war and the consequences coming with it.

The fact that death is the narrator of the story truly turns it into a unique reading experience, whereas death is not portrayed as a heartless and cruel Grim Reaper, but as a being who questions, struggles, and is capable of empathy.The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugliness and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both.

Since I feel that I owe Markus Zusak for this wonderful story, I'll do my best.The Book Thief is a story set in Nazi Germany during World War 2. Something that makes this book unique is that it is narrated by Death but Death isn't portrayed to be anything we imagine him to be like.  \n\n\nA small piece of truth\n\n\n\nI don't carry a sickle or scytheI only wear hooded black robe when it is cold.And I don't have those skull-likefacial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance.You want to know what I truly look like?I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue.\nZusak personifies Death to be an interesting character.Death is amiable, humourous, thoughtful, soulful, he is trying to understand the humans as much as we are. \n\u201cThe consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both.\u201d\u201cI wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race-that rarely do I ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant.\u201d\n During the dark days of war, Death comes in possession of a book written by a girl name Liesel Meminger who wrote about her life and people around her from the year 1939 to 1943. In a way the title The Book Thief refers to both Death and Liesel, the latter steals books out of hunger for words and pages (how can you not like a sweet and kind character who loves books so passionately?)It all starts when Liesel is sent to foster care by her mother at the age of 9. Her foster parents Hans Hubermann and Rosa Hubermann are poor Germans living in a town called Molching. Hans Hubermann is a painter by trade and played the accordion. He's a calm, kind and silent man who reflects serenity around him. Liesel takes instant liking for him. Hans Hubermann is my favourite fictional father. Rosa Hubermann is nothing like her husband, instead she's bad-tempered and foul-mouthed but the more you read, the more you realise that the woman has a larger heart than anyone can imagine. Her way of showing love was just very different.\n\u201cMake no mistake, the woman had a heart. She had a bigger one that people would think. There was a lot in it, stored up, high in miles of hidden shelving. Remember that she was the woman with the instrument strapped to her body in the long, moon-slit night. She was a Jew-feeder without a question in the world on a man's first night in Molching. She was an arm-reacher deep into a mattress to deliver a sketchbook to a teenage girl\u201d\nJust like all towns, Molching was filled with characters. One of them was a boy next door, Rudy Stiener who obsessed with Jesse Owens. Rudy was always destined to become Liesel's best friend, partner and catalyst in crime. \n\"A snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship\"\nAlong with Liesel, Rudy is one of my all-time favourite characters. He's sweet, funny, considerate, gallant and athletic, how could I not fall for him?\n\"He was the crazy one who painted himself black and defeated the world. She was the book thief without the words.\"\nZusak shows us that words are powerful and beautiful, they can forge a bridge of friendship between a 10 year old German girl and a 26 year old Jew who seeks sanctuary in Hubermann's basement. Words can wound, words can heal, words can even outlast death.Zusak is a genius, he has brilliantly portrayed the struggles of common Germans in Nazi Germany. He makes you fall for the characters, he makes you want to care for them, he makes you want to be a part of their story. Zusak portrays happiness, love, joy, friendship, beauty, brutality, grief and pain powerfully in his novel. He is an artist of words, painter of vivid imagination. He has painted the most beautiful and euphonious descriptions and quotes that I've never read before...\n\u201cI like that every page in every book can have a gem on it. It's probably what I love most about writing--that words can be used in a way that's like a child playing in a sandpit, rearranging things, swapping them around. They're the best moments in a day of writing -- when an image appears that you didn't know would be there when you started work in the morning.\u201d\u201cIn years to come, he would be a giver of bread, not a stealer - proof again of the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. Just add water.\u201d \u201cA human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both. Still, they have one thing I envy. Humans, if nothing else, have the good sense to die.\u201d \u201cLike most misery, it started with apparent happiness.\u201d \u201cHis soul sat up. It met me. Those kinds of souls always do - the best ones. The ones who rise up and say \"I know who you are and I am ready. Not that I want to go, of course, but I will come.\" Those souls are always light because more of them have been put out. More of them have already found their way to other places.\u201d\nThe Book Thief made me cry but I'm not giving it 5 stars because it managed to do that. I'm giving it 5 stars because I loved the story, I cared for the characters, I felt their joy, pain and loss, I laughed with them and cried with them, I got immersed in their story.

Who else could voice such detachment that the reader would be lulled into reliving the horrors of World War II. Who else could then intercede between a past made real and the inventive story about to unfold? It could only be this narrator. It could only be Death.Zusak's Death is as removed from clich\u00e9 as his startling metaphors. This is no scythe wielding wraith. Zusak's Death is dutiful, observant and curious. His voice expresses both irony and unexpected compassion. It's an omniscient voice that drops hints of future events with coy modesty.As for metaphor, the images are layered, dynamic, often turning in unexpected and even contrary directions. Key incidents evoke memories of color: white, black and red, Death explains. \u201cRed.\u201d The prominent color of the Nazi banner. The obvious reference to \u201cblood\u201d is never mentioned once in Zusak's lengthy passage linking the color to what Death witnesses.\u201cHimmel\u201d is used by Zusak to express multiple ironies. The neighborhood where the main characters reside is on Himmel St. It is far from \u201cheavenly.\u201d Yet, the street is destined to find a fatal connection with the sky. Early on in the book, Liesel looks up. The sky itself is transformed from something distant and light to something heavy and opaque:  \u201c...like spillage \u2013 cold and heavy, slippery and gray \u2013 but once in a while some stars had the nerve to rise and float....[until] the stars were dragged down again, into the waters of the German sky.\u201d (p.45)Universal themes of guilt and evil are unavoidable when contemplating the Holocaust. Zusak, however, approaches these themes from the very personal viewpoints of the characters. The pervasive guilt that haunts them is survivor's guilt. Evil is condensed into a cartoonishly symbolic figure of Hitler. The decisions to resist result from personal experiences rather than moral choices. Zusak is particularly adept at approaching his themes through the children in this book. He captures the innocent audacity in Rudy's idolization of the triumphant Olympiad Jesse Owens. He tracks Liesel's gradual awareness of her mother's fate, and the \u201cthey\u201d who are responsible. The celebratory act she commits is appropriately on Hitler's birthday, when a bonfire of banned books has been ignited. Zusak is less successful in portraying his adult characters. Poverty-crushed Rosa, Liesel's foster mother, is portrayed in heavy-handed fashion: she fuels her frustration with anger and verbal abuse. Hans, Rosa's long-suffering husband, is almost too good to be believable. Max the guilt-stricken Jew they are hiding, exposes his most intimate side as the author of a series of illustrated books he creates for Liesel. His imaginary boxing matches with Hitler felt less convincing. It was an intrusion of the author's own attachment to the boxing metaphor and it doesn't quite work in this situation. The parading of a group of starving Jews through the town on their way to Dachau was another heavy-handed insertion, with its obvious comparison to Christ's march from Calvary.On the whole, this is an unforgettable and moving book. It draws attention to the power of words. On the one hand, there is Liesel's compulsive desire to learn to read, and to inhabit the persona of the \u201cWord Shaker.\u201d On the other hand, she is forced to admit that the source of Hitler's power was also words \u2013 words and symbols that fed a mindless mass following. Zusak's own power, however, is in writing a book that brings his characters to life and makes us care about their eventual fates. I was surprised to learn that this book was marketed as young adult fiction in the U.S. In the author's home country of Australia it was marketed as an adult novel. This was the selection of our local book club.NOTES:This was a review that points out both the flaws and strengths of the book: https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-en...There is an interesting passage in the book when Liesl realizes that Hitler as well as herself had been empowered by words.

That said, this is still the best Holocaust book I've read since Elie Wiesel's Night, which I read more than 30 years ago. Actually, this is the best book I've read in a long time.The book -- for the most part -- details the day-to-day existence in a small Bavarian village near Munich of a foster child, Liesel Meminger, the eponymous book thief; her best friend, Rudy Steiner; and her loving foster family, the Hubermanns. Narrated by Death himself, the language in the novel is oftentimes poetically existential:...THE COLORS...RED, WHITE, BLACK:They fall on top of each other, the scribbled signature black, onto the blinding global white, onto the thick soupy red.Yes, often, I am reminded of her [Liesel], and in one of my vast array of pockets, I have kept her story to retell. It is one of the small legion I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right. Each one an attempt -- an immense leap of an attempt -- to prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it.At other times, the irony is knee-deep, as in when Death explains the Third Reich in Chapter 9:In a way, it was destiny.You see, people may tell you that Nazi Germany was built on anti-Semitism, a somewhat overzealous leader, and a nation of hate-fed bigots, but it would all have come to nothing had the Germans not loved one particular activity:To burn.The Germans loved to burn things. Shops, synagogues, Reichstags, houses, personal items, slain people, and of course, books. They enjoyed a good book-burning, all right....The Book Thief remains a page-turner throughout, never descending to preachiness or cheap sentimentality.

I was completely blank and I was not feeling any thing. Tears were rolling down my face and I wiped them off quickly. I was speechless.Still, I will try because I want to share how much I loved it(or as I said I hated it)Book CoverI always say covers are important to me. But, for this book I don't care a damn how good or bad the cover is. Had I got this book without a cover or with a title alone on a blank front page, I would have felt the same. PlotIt is a story of a girl, Liesel Meminger; an accordionist, Hans Hubermann; a Jewish fist-fighter, Max Vandenburg; a boy whose hair were the color of lemon, Rudy Steiner; a woman who cursed, Rosa Hubermann; a woman with a library at home, Ilsa Hermann and a boy who could not hear properly and twitched Tommy M\u00fcller. And there is quite a lot of thievery.The book is set in Molching, Germany during the World War II. It is set at the time when people were struggling to live and a girl, Liesel, a foster girl is struggling to read. For she has discovered she can't resist books and along with her foster father she learns to read in the basement of their house. As the summary says 'this is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul.'CharactersI loved all the characters in this book. Leslie is a very strong character who struggles to accept her new life and learns to read despite being looked down upon by other children from school. Its amazing to see how she deals with so many things at such a young age.Hans Hubermann and Rudy Steiner were my favorites. Hans Hubermann is so full of hope and is so kind and he is such a great character. He is simply flawless. Rudy, the boy with lemon hair - he really made me smile so many times when I read this book.What I like?Everything. There are so many moments in the book that just rip my heart out. I have no words what this book did to me. The writing is beautiful and poetic. For me Markus Zusak is one of the best writers right now. I read his I am the Messenger and I fell in love with it. And this book! These two books just stand out because they have such different and unique stories. And the writing is mesmerizing. This story is so unique. The story, the words, the writing and the fact that this book is narrated by Death - how can it not be unique?What I did not like?Nothing. Absolutely nothing. This book is perfect!My final opinion on this bookRead it for it beautiful and poetic writing, for its uniqueness, to understand the power of words and to feel different emotions. Read it if you love to read. Read it if you are not a reader; just make an exception and pick up this book and you will not regret. May be this book will turn you into a reader or even if it doesn't, at least you will be able to say that the only book you read is one of the best.

What really transcended me at first in this book, was the humanity of it. One would believe that a book told from death\u2019s perspective would be gloomy and sad, well, it is but Death in the Book Thief shows more humanity than most within the lines.The imagery is one of the most vivid I have ever encountered, very dense, almost like an explosion of all senses. Which is interesting since the narrator chooses to attribute colours to each person\u2019s passing and soon Molching appears a painting palette on a black canvas, one that is reverberated in Hans\u2019 painting jobs. It is something that resonated all the more as my copy of the book shows the title in big letters paint brushed on a black background. I loved the clear separation between Death\u2019s colourful narration and the omniscient \u2018matter-of-fact\u2019 approach to Liesel story.I noticed that the main complain registered was the narration\u2019s slow pace. This is something I can understand as, from an European perspective, and that is a personal opinion of course, I grew up learning about the two world wars, with a particular attention brought to WWII, and I am used to reading long pieces of work about it, whether it is about the war itself, or the cities bombing, of France\u2019s resistance. For this reason, I totally understand why the pace could present flaws to readers who might not have been confronted with the different war stories, because their upbringing might not have focused on the two world wars - but I do admit that the pace was slow, it just didn't bother me as I sensed a greater impact- and meaning in between the lines.That being said, the writing is engaging and very smooth. The poetic prose doesn\u2019t overpower the plot, it helps to understand certain atrocious aspects of the war, picture an infamous chromatic spectrum from another angle. The only flaw I would find is that it can be a bit hard to get into at first. I did find myself struggling to understand Death\u2019s narrative but I quickly got used to it so it is not something that prevents understanding the book altogether.

I felt the author went too far in his attempts to make the readers cry.In the starting, the brother of the protagonist, Liesel, dies in a train while they are travelling along with their mother and these are the thoughts of our narrator Death:\"How could she walk?How could she move?(She-the mother)That's the sort of thing I'll never know or comprehend-what humans are capable of.\"Now what exactly do you want her to do! Shed bucket loads of tears and go into paralysis? Moronic.He also says that he hates us humans, we baffle him. Now the way we are, is no different from the other species inhabiting the earth. In fact, we might be better than some, one of the most profound experiences I have ever had is watching a bunch hyenas eat the guts of a wildebeest who is still alive (thank you discovery channel,) now dying from a bomb falling over your head is definitely better than that.Please don't think that I'm in favor of wars and bombs, I'm not. But what I'm saying is that the death portrayed by the author is either stupid or paradoxical. If he is saying what he saying after a million years of observation, he has to be stupid and if he was smarter, he wouldn't have said that. Death offers you no insights as to how we should be in this 600 page snooze fest that you couldn't have got from a decent short story.Another point to be noticed is the appearance of the word \"kommunist\". It crops up a lot in the first half, Liesel is intrigued by the mystery surrounding this word and then it disappears. It's not mentioned even once in the latter half. I personally don't know much about the attitude of \"zee germans\" towards communism and was hoping that it'll have more complex political themes later on, but was disappointed.", "num_likes": 27, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "19063.The_Book_Thief", "book_id": "19063", "book_title": "The Book Thief", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/163684686", "review_id": "163684686", "date": "Apr 26, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Tima", "user_url": "/user/show/5300365-tima", "text": "This book is amazing! Those words seem so inadequete to describe how I feel. It reached in and grabbed my heart and didn't let go the entire time. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it drew me into a different side of a much told story. It was a side I hadn't experienced and I loved it.I took this book everywhere with me, just in case I might have a spare moment to read. At first I thought I was drawn to the story because, like the character, I had difficulty learning to read properly. And now I'm a huge book lover. But I don't think that was the reason. The author has the unique ability to draw someone in and before they realize what has happened they are hooked.The story begins with the narrator telling the reader how he knows the main character. I don't recall him mentioning his name, but I'll tell you. His name is death. And he tells about the first time he met Liesel when she was just a little girl. Death comes to claim the souls of the people as they die and that is where he meets her for the first time. It's also when she steals her first book.The time is set at the beginning of Hitler and takes you to the end of the war and through the journey of Liesel, the book thief. This book isn't just about a war or books. It's about the complexity of humanity. We can be so evil and so cruel. But we can also be so warm and beautiful.I think the words of Death at end sum up so much -I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race-that rarely do I ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and it's words and stories so damning and brilliant.None of those things, however, came out of my mouth.All I was able to do was turn to Liesel Meminger and tell her the only truth I truly know. I said it to the book thief and I say it now to you.I am haunted by humans.I don't typically like war books and I hate to cry. But this was both for me and I loved it. So please don't let those things stop you from reading this book.

A story begins in train where she, her mother and brother were on their way to new foster family. Unfortunately, Liesel was the only one who reaches the final station. First months in a new unfamiliar place were very hard for her. Her foster parents are complete opposites from each other. Her foster father Hans Hubermann is a caring and kind man who was a first person, who reaches out a hand to Liesel. He taught her how to read, write and love books even if he wasn't good in it. However, her foster mother Rosa Hubermann is a strong, strict woman, who cannot easily show her feelings. Despite it, she is a good person and a caring mother. Their family isn't wealthy and World War II doesn't make things easier for them. Even then together with her friend, she knew how to bring small happiness to their lives. That's when stealing the books begin and love to book grow. Their lives got harder when the Jew knocks to their door. The Jew who becomes a friend, member of the family and a person who brings warmth to their house. Sad reality and life of the poor German family during the II World War shown from the little girl\u2018s point of view. Beautiful friendships, finding love heartbreaking loss and finding happiness in simple stolen books. These are the things you can find in this wonderful book. I love all of Liesel's friendships that began in this book. Friendship with Hans and Rosa Hubermann, Max Vandenburg, Rudy Steiner - all of them have a beautiful value. They taught her what love means. I didn't expect that I will enjoy reading this book as much as I did. The book have a lot of important values that people are forgetting these days. It's not a book for everyone. It's a very sad and heartbreaking story so if you don't like to cry during reading a book, don't even try to buy this book. The ending absolutely destroyed me. I couldn't stop crying for another 15 minutes after the ending. Personally, I think it is the best book I've read this year and I would like to thank my boyfriend so much for buying me this book. It's a beautiful gift that brought new adventure to my life.

Death's. I felt simultaneously drawn into the story, but still removed from it in a way as well. Even death has a heart.That brings me to the main character of this story, Liesel. I adored how fleshed out her character was. I really felt like I knew her on a deeper level than \"just a character in a book\", which is something I often find myself struggling with. As for the writing.. Being a historical fiction, I was expecting myself to struggle reading The Book Thief and fortunately that wasn't really the case. I didn't fly through it, but I would still categorize it as a quick read - especially compared to other his fic's I've read in the past. I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.But. Even though I liked a lot of aspects regarding\u00a0The Book Thief, I did end up feeling disappointed as well. So many people have been telling me it's one of their absolute favorites. Not to mention how many said it's such a tearjerker. I didn't shed one tear? Even though I enjoyed this book, I didn't get consumed by it? I guess?Overall an enjoyable read, but I definitely won't be saying this is one of the best books I ever read.
