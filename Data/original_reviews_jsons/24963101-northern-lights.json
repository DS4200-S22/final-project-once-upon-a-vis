Before I go into the depths of character and plot, let me start by saying this book is up there with other fantasy hard hitters: by this I mean books like The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia: the books that define the genre. This is high praise indeed, and this novel is worthy of it. The protagonist of the book is Lyra, a young girl, who is parentless and seemingly friendless. She has grown up in an Oxford College and has developed a detachment to her guardians. She spends her days enjoying her youth and harassing those that turn out to be some of her greatest allies. For her, this book is a journey of self-discovery: a way of exploring the limits of her character and potential. Her adventure sees her befriend an armoured polar bear and become the wielder of the golden compass. This is initially described as a lie detector but it is apparent that the depths of its power have not been fully explored. \"It lay heavily in her hands,the crystal face gleaming, the brass body exquisitely machined. It was very much like a clock, or a compass, for there were hands pointing around the dial, but instead of the hours or the points of a compass there were several little pictures with extraordinary precision, as if on ivory with the slenderest sable brush. She turned the dial around to look at them all. There was an anchor; an hourglass surmounted by a skull; a bull, a beehive\u2026..Thirty-six altogether and she couldn\u2019t even guess what they meant.\"This book retains all the classic elements of fantasy: magic, mythical creatures and supernatural phenomena. The world Pullman has created is physically intertwined with our own; there are references to cities and countries in which his idea has been planted. Each human has a daemon that is essentially their soul. These take on the form of an animal that is representative of the person, for example someone who is enthusiastic and friendly has a colourful cat whereas as solider has a wolf or a hound. The author does very little to explain this. It is just thing \u201cthing\u201d that we are told about at the start but through the book but we begin to see the significance of it. The fact that children\u2019s daemons change is a subtle hint how children can be influenced and have not found their identity where as adults are secure and confident. In this the author has created an air of mystery as we explore the true meaning of the bond as we read further.  The plot is fantastic. The author manages to surprise the reader on several occasions as he drops several, massive plot turns. This sees the story go into unexpected directions. From the beginning of reading a book, you begin to predict what will happen. Some books are completely predictable and obvious in their direction; this one was not. I physically gasped at some moments as I found myself awed by the author\u2019s storytelling; this is when several characters origins, in relation to Lyra are defined. The book begins as a simple rescue mission but ends as a story that is questioning the morals of all characters involved. The fate of the characters is destined in the mysteriousness of the northern lights; the gateway to beyond. This is one of those books that is applicable to all ages; it originally appears to be a children\u2019s book, but it can be enjoyed by anyone. Much of the content in here touches on themes that most children would not comprehend fully, never mind be able to philosophise about. The author considers spirituality, religion, morals and the existence of the soul, amongst other things. Most children would not pick up on these references and understand the significance of them; however, they would still adore the book.The book can be seen as two separate entities existing at the same time; the first, and most obvious, is the one that appeals to children; the saving of innocents from despotic adults with lots of exciting characters. The second is on a deeper scale; the author explores the conflicting powers of science and religion, manipulation and morality in terms of actions being for a greater good. In this the author is a genius, he has wrote a book that can be both a children\u2019s bed time read and an adult\u2019s point of pondering.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________", "num_likes": 703, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["contemporary-lit", "fantasy", "sci-fi", "5-star-reads", "children-of-all-ages"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/683662340", "review_id": "683662340", "date": "Aug 01, 2013", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Jayson", "user_url": "/user/show/22106879-jayson", "text": "(B+) 78% | GoodNotes: A solid story and well written, but very much a children's tale with one child going on a quest to save other children.", "num_likes": 746, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["genre-young-adult", "genre-juvenile-fantasy", "300-399-pp", "read-in-2009", "subject-parallel-universe", "genre-anthropomorphic", "read-in-2007", "genre-steampunk", "author-british"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1420206733", "review_id": "1420206733", "date": "Oct 19, 2015", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Sean Gibson", "user_url": "/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson", "text": "I don\u2019t love the Beatles.*Ducks as he is castigated by the seething masses*I also don\u2019t love green vegetables, punches to the face, or going to the dentist, though I don\u2019t think those revelatory disclosures will elicit much in the way of rage-fueled attempts to slit my throat with the jagged edge of a broken CD (compact disc, kiddos\u2014look it up).

Well, because it\u2019s the best way I can think of to articulate my feelings about The Golden Compass.I don\u2019t LOVE the Beatles, but I recognize their skill and talent and appreciate them for the impact they had on popular music. There are Beatles songs that I enjoy. I think I might have a Beatles album on my iPod (though I\u2019ve never actually played it on my iPod).

Well, no. But, he is a skilled writer with a gift for storytelling and world building. He\u2019s a talented technician and stylist. But, I don\u2019t love The Golden Compass. I appreciate that it\u2019s a well-written and well-conceived story, but, as agents revel in saying to me when I pitch them, \u201cI just didn\u2019t connect with the material.\u201d I can see why people (ahem, Kristin) love this series, and I certainly would not dissuade anyone who\u2019s interested in reading it from giving it a go.

However, contemporary science fiction has introduced new possibilities of experimenting with alternate realities, e.g. travelling through time (Wells\u2019 Time Machine) or through space (Stapledon\u2019s Star Maker). More interestingly, it introduced the possibility of parallel worlds: utopias (Huxley\u2019s Brave New World is a utopia cum grano salis), dystopias (Orwell\u2019s 1984, Atwood\u2019s Handmaid's Tale), uchronias (Philip K. Dick\u2019s Man in the High Castle), fantasy worlds or, if you will, alternate Middle Ages (Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings, Martin\u2019s Game of Thrones).Philip Pullman\u2019s Northern Lights is an ambitious combination of all of the above. The protagonist, young Lyra Belacqua, lives in an alternate England. Her world is, in general, similar to ours, but everything is a little bit misaligned. It\u2019s a world where a puritanical Church rules over everything, where Scandinavian culture is pervasive, where people travel mostly by boat and zeppelin (steampunk-style), where each person has an accompanying d\u00e6mon \u2014 a sort of sentient cuddly pet, shamanistic animal spirit, or Freudian Id, perhaps \u2014, where one can meet witches and armoured bears, and own strange objects that look like a pocket watch but tell the truth instead of the time\u2026 At all events, Pullman has built one the richest, weirdest, most fascinating and consistent fictional worlds in contemporary literature. He also has succeeded in creating a magnificent gallery of supporting characters: Lord Asriel, John Faa, Iorek Byrnison, Serafina Pekkala \u2014 all are endearing and colourful. Pullman\u2019s prose is exquisite, and the scope of his story is staggering. For all that \u2014 possibly because this was meant to be a children\u2019s book \u2014, the plot is surprisingly lively and easy to follow \u2014 some of the scenes are memorable indeed, like the attempted poisoning at the start (ch. 1) or Lyra\u2019s slyness with the bear-king (ch. 19).I find it surprising that Pullman\u2019s book was not received with at least as much acclaim as, say, J. K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series. The fact that Northern Lights contains some anticlerical ideas and gave the god-botherers a queasy stomach is beside the point. However, it is possible that Pullman\u2019s novel introduces too many ideas at the same time without developing them fully and does not quite provide a clear sense of closure and of what it is all about by the end of this long first part. It left me with a downbeat sensation, asking myself while closing the book, \u201ceventually, why should I care about all that picaresque and slightly fantastical adventure?\u201d. The 2007 film adaptation (with Nicole Kidman, Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, and Christopher Lee) tried to compress Pullman\u2019s novel even further but only managed to highlight the plot\u2019s flaws. At any rate, I am sure that the next part, The Subtle Knife, will compensate for these slight inconveniences.Edit: Watched the first season of the BBC/HBO His Dark Materials TV series. It is much better than the 2007 movie, probably because a TV series provides ample space to develop the storyline, while a 120 minutes movie was like a bed of Procrustes, compressing and sabotaging Pullman\u2019s narrative. The TV show seems to be taking the exact opposite direction and expands on the plot and characters beyond the limits of the novel. The result is still somewhat confusing, but the slower pace provides a sense of danger and darkness that is quite gripping. Dafne Keen and Ruth Wilson, who play the two female protagonists, are both fabulous.", "num_likes": 228, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1148857932", "review_id": "1148857932", "date": "Feb 21, 2018", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Hailey (Hailey in Bookland)", "user_url": "/user/show/21937982-hailey-hailey-in-bookland", "text": "2.5*I never read this as a kid and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had, but it was just okay for me!", "num_likes": 219, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["owned", "fantasy"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/10383601", "review_id": "10383601", "date": "Dec 13, 2007", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Bright", "user_url": "/user/show/304479-bright", "text": "the golden compass trilogy seems like a natural progression in christian literature. yes, it is christian literature, the same way the chronicles of narnia are. aslan is only a lion when the reader is about 10 or so in the united states. after a point, he unrepentantly becomes jesus. and the four children are like, the gospels or something. and the story is somewhat ruined then, because as an adult, you can't just shoehorn jesus into a lion outfit without snickering a little.pullman however, has solved this problem. i can't continue without utterly spoiling the story for everyone who hasn't read it, so consider yourselves warned...he made jesus into a little girl. even better, he made jesus into a little girl who doesn't even know she's jesus. now how's that for a new twist on the new testament? the part that's particularly brilliant about it, is that it actually worked. lyra is never really anything like christ... she just follows the path of his narrative. first, she has the absent father. lord asrael is desperately involved in his own ideas, so though he's not actually in heaven, he may as well be. wait a sec, isn't this just dogma again? sort of, except dogma is really more relevant to catholicism in particular, rather than scriptures. and instead of linda fiorentino who is kind of a mopey christ, we get a 10 year old girl. 10 year old girls are the best focal point for any story. i've been one for years.and this is a perfect choice, because she really never takes time to mope. she doesn't miss her faith or wrestle with it... she doesn't believe at all. and therein lies the genius of pullman's work, that has all the christians in a snit; she's also the antichrist.why would he do that?because the bible does. if you really take a look at the word antichrist, it does not mean \"evil\". khristos, from which christ is derived, means \"anointed\". so what does antichrist really mean? unanointed, or that which is against the anointed. there's a bunch of baggage on top of that meaning, which is how we got those omen movies, but at the heart of it, it just means smeared with fat. actually, it means recognized by the divine... but in ancient times, we did that by smearing the recognized thing with the fat of a sacrificed animal or person. and that, is why we celebrate the crucifixion. it was the point of christ's birth. as if it wasn't obvious enough, it's why he's referred to as the lamb.wow. so this is heavy... pullman has gone all the way back to the origins of the judeo-christian faith and said, this important guy, was just the carrier of this magical stuff that we're obsessed with, that we don't even use anymore. it's like we're infected or poisoned by this idea. we need an antidote. we need an antichrist, to show us how far we've wandered from the truth, which had nothing to do with trooping along after some guy.and this explains why christians are so antagonized by the books. they've been following the beast for years without recognizing it. the golden compass referred to in the book, is the bible we've all forgotten how to read. and in its stead, we've rallied around the church which claims to help us understand the symbols. but in reality, it is the beast referred to. the one which rose from rome, with many heads that change over time. so what really, is the golden compass about? it's about how to be human again. how to regain an understanding of the world, that doesn't rely on our fragile expectations for good and evil. all it requires, is that you give up everything, in order to discover what is important again. and i don't know how christians could have missed that primary message.

If you want to make cracks about being a trophy wife, go right ahead, but to insinuate that I would \"skim\" a book to have the minimum knowledge required to give the appearance of having read it so that I can give it a bad review b/c reasons, is an attack on my character and work ethic. I'm not some conservative religious zealot who think books with magic are sending our children straight to hell. I don't have children. I'm not a Christian. I do, however, have four nephews, all under eight years old that I have already given HARRY POTTER and many, many other similar books, THE GOLDEN COMPASS not among them.3. In regards to my perceived lack of faith in a child's intelligence, I'm baffled that you think that's the only issue. \"Children aren't stupid. They have good instincts. Shame on you.\"Are you going to tell me that children also have excellent impulse control? That they're always rational? That they aren't capable of making bad decisions when overwrought?

The two adults Lyra should be most dependent on are villains, and whether or not there are good role models among the secondary cast of characters, they are SECONDARY, ultimately insignificant roles as evidenced when dollface takes off on her own b/c her parents cannot be trusted, and she knows better than they do. The fact that it's true in her scenario is exactly what concerns me.You can draw a straight line through all the steps on the path to a child's inevitable conclusion that Adults are the Enemy, and to do good, to do right, you cannot trust or obey them.I think that's a very dangerous, potentially harmful thing to teach a child. You don't have to agree with me. In fact, the whole reason I'm writing this, years after I read the book, is b/c I didn't want to be that person who essentially outlines their own (possibly contradictory) review on someone else's post. B/c those people suck. FYI. <------read between the lines.I don't recommend this book for readers not in their teens. Yes, some children mature faster than others, and, especially, if the child in question is your own, you're the best judge of what is appropriate--I would never tell anyone what to do with their children.

As an adult in stressful times looking for a comforting winter fantasy read, I decided to revisit this classic of the genre, and this time I liked it immensely, so much it got me out of my reading slump. This is a book that reminds you why you love reading. Pullman is a tremendously talented writer and storyteller. The flow and plot of the novel are unique, creative, and massively engaging. There is not one moment of boredom in the whole novel, it is action-packed, but most thoughtfully, creating one magical story, one that you cannot easily forget.This book also got me interested in Philip Pullman as a person, as well as his worldview, philosophy and perspective on spirituality and religion. What we see in this novel is an inversion of moral values. The Church is very important in the world of Dark Materials, it is the force that controls society and patrols the matter of reason, science, and development, in a really negative way. Science is also painted as negative, the discipline that makes innocent suffer in order to achieve progress. Religion and science do not have good connotations, and the true morals and correct way of being have to be discovered and found by and in individuals. Our protagonist Lyra, is opposing the overruling forces of society, assisted by outlaws on the margins of society as Iorek, witches and sailors Gyptians. The book grapples with many profound questions and the intricate relationship of philosophy, science and religion. It criticizes authoritarianism, and religious authority, which leaves little room for dissent or pluralism of views, and diminishes the freedom of the individual to discover personal and unique standpoint. Lyra's parents are also villains, and the positive foundation, usually found in the figures of authority (kings, priests, headmasters and parents) is absent. It is evident that Pullman has strong distrust in the figures of authority, at least ones that don\u2019t allow any scope for argument or dissent.Without any solid foundations, trust, or stability of authority figures, our protagonist is not able to create the inner compass of detecting right or wrong, the conscience or the superego, as everybody who ought to be good in her world is deceptive, and those who ought to be evil are good. The moral inversion is present - the evil does not come from outside, from monsters, but from the inside, society and figures of authority, those who claim to be righteous, and the help and salvation come from the outside, ones that are found the be useless or undesirable by the majority. Lyra, therefore, has a magical compass - an extension of ego, an item representing only stability, that helps her to find the right perspective, the truth that is so hard to grasp in this confusing world. Lyra's special power is to see value in things and those who seem to be invaluable, and also, to expose the deceitfulness of those who claim to be good, but are evil, being a trickster character, driven by curiosity and critical intelligence.The concept of d\u00e6mon is also brilliant. D\u00e6mons are animals that are an external physical manifestation of a person's \"inner-self\", with changing appearance in children and fixed appearance in adults, a brilliant literary tool for exploring characters naturally within the text. Animals that help and follow their hero companions are an ancient concept seen in myths and fairy tales. Animals often solve quests that heroes are not capable of resolving themselves, representing the primitive instincts, animal urges and primal energy of the psyche put in the useful concrete function. Also, the choice of words for these accompanying animals in Pullman world is interesting and was off-putting for me as a child, obviously alluding to the word demon that usually has a negative connotation of spiritual destructive evil forces, but here represents the person soul. In the name Pullman is consistent with his moral inversion that is present thorough his world-building. Similarly, the word Gyptians also alludes to Gypsies, folk that often symbolically represents human shadow in stories, people in which civilized society projects the repressed traits. Gyptians are outcasts and the positive figures that enable Lyra to progress in her quest. Also, Lyra, in order to succeed, has to use lies, distort reality, and even use truth as a deception to reach the goals, not a usual thing for heroin to use for victory, as these traits are usually utilised by villains. Determinism and free will are also touched upon interestingly, as Lyra has a fixed destiny, that can only be achieved if she is not aware of it, and thinks she is making free choices. \u201cWe are all subject to the fates. But we must act as if we are not, or die of despair.\u201dPullman critiqued Tokien's and C.S. Lewis's works, oftentimes unjustly, due to their Christian beliefs that left more or less subtle marks on their world and characters. They are my favorite writers, one of the most influential ones in my reading life, and I like the classical fantasy story of a hero fighting dark forces and monsters, one where the good and evil are much more split and well defined, put in the more predictable categories than in Pullman world. I think that a fantasy writer's worldview has a massive impact on the kind of world he is creating. For instance, I could not connect to R.R. Martin's writing, because I could not find a sense of meaning in his storylines, his world being saturated with nihilism and random suffering, without a clear vision or moral lesson, or a metaphor of psychological development that more classic hero story has, all things I quite like in fantasy genre. For exploring absurdism and nihilism I prefer literary fiction and stories put in reality, not in the imaginative world. But with years I found I like morally gray characters as in Abercrombie's writing and made space for the imaginative world of unordinary Pullman. Pullman is not a king of nihilism, but fantasy moral inversion as good and evil in his world are unpredictable and unordinary, as they oftentimes in life are. It is often said that he created an atheistic world, but I think that is a far too simplistic way of thinking. R.R.Martin created atheistic, but Pullman created a gnostic world, and some call Dark Materials as a retelling of Milton's Paradise Lost. Pullman beliefs in multiple worlds and spiritual realms, not a binary good and evil model. Pullman is passionate to reinvent and redefine, asking provocative questions and exposing hypocrisy, the trickster of the fantasy genre.The classical white and black world is maybe more suitable to the child due to the fact that children are not completely able to integrate good and evil traits into one object, so the negative traits of mothers are more easily comprehended expressed in evil witches or a dragon. But, adults should be aware that a fixed unexamined worldview of good and evil figures is harmful and that oftentimes the things are not as they seem. In Nietzsche's notion, in adulthood, a person is called to reexamine and discard the integrated false and destructive beliefs of their parents, authority figures, and society, the ones that are a threat to integrity, authenticity and individuality, that were advertised as useful and good. And that is why I salute Pullman, this intelligent genre provocateur that exposes what happens when people dogmatically follow abstractions.That being said, the person has to be smart in the process and not discard the parts of tradition and integrated beliefs that are useful and valuable. That is my only critique of Pullman, that he could become far more reductionistic and discard something as complex as human religion or authoritative figures and characterize them as completely wrong. There is a phase in psychotherapy when a person becomes aware of the negative traits of their parents and completely demonizes them. But, that is only a stop in the journey, not a destination. As always, maturity lies in tolerating the ambiguity of one object, being aware of its both good and bad traits, discarding the bad, and keeping the good.

It\u2019s fantasy, it has made-up words, it is a trilogy \u2013 WHY!!!!! Why can\u2019t somebody write a fantasy book that stops at a decent time???? There is an explanation of how to pronounce \u2018daemon\u2019 before the book even starts and that\u2019s enough to make my heart sink. So why am I reading it? Because I\u2019ve been backed into a corner by a friend and I can\u2019t figure out another way of getting out. Here it is then. A grumpy person reading a type of book they don\u2019t want to read and are opening it up for all the wrong reasons.And then\u2026straight away, within a page or two: what a heart-thumper, what a brilliant unputdownable ripsnorter. Impossible not to compare with Larsson\u2019s books, and comes out so far ahead on all counts I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to read the last Girl-Tattoo book after all.This guy writes well, Larsson doesn\u2019t. He has a plot that is worthy of the name for the entire book. When I wanted to stop reading the first Larsson after 140 pages and was told that it got good soon, well, honestly, I stuck with it and the advice was correct, but still. That\u2019s a lot of wasted pages. Larsson\u2019s female character is a pastiche of current fashion:(1)\tAnti-social(2)\tMetal in odd places(3)\tPunk rocker(4)\tShags girls, heterosexual male fantasy(5)\tShags much old men, ditto(6)\tBoob job(7)\tComputer whizzLarsson gets away with this, even though this amalgam feels fake. Lyra needs nothing. She is just a girl with nothing special about her at all and she is fabulous. Already I\u2019m wondering if this series is going to get spoiled by her growing up and sex coming into play. One of the things this book demonstrates is how utterly irrelevant and tedious the sex is in books like Larsson\u2019s. It is just there to titillate, it has no intrinsic purpose whatsoever.I\u2019m gobsmacked by how much more believable this book is than Larsson\u2019s. Daemons, talking bears, witches, universes coming out of universes \u2013 I\u2019m half expecting a string theorist to pop into the story, but as long as that doesn\u2019t happen I can\u2019t imagine anything could spoil the rest of it. I\u2019m trying to picture who wouldn\u2019t enjoy this, and I\u2019m coming up with a complete prune of a person. If I enjoy this, honestly, anybody would. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m even going to give the rest of the series a go.--------------------Finished! The last forty pages or so, after the duel of the bears, lost me. Maybe because they weren't really about the story, they are about setting the scene for the next book...I don't know.

I really liked the 2007 movie with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, wish that it had continued, heard the Catholic Church denouncing Pullman was part of it, dunno. We are continuing to read in this house the second trilogy.9/25/2020:This is a second reading of Pullman's classic, accomplished on vacation in a car, with the family, by listening to the 9 cd audio collection, with Phillip Pullman Himself reading the narration and beautifully, with a cast of fine actors taking various parts. The first of a trilogy entitled His Dark Materials, which is a great fantasy story supposedly appropriate for grade 6 (American schools) but is really all ages, and like Wrinkle in Time, has dimensions in it which you will discover at any age. It IS a kid's book, in so many ways, with a strong girl main character, Lyra, 11, who is set on freeing her friend and other children from the north, with the help of Gyptions, an armored polar bear, witches, a Texan aeronaut balloonist, among others. This first volume is wonderful fun, focused as it is on Lyra and adventure. Lyra is a pretty unforgettable young girl character, who really grows over the trilogy, and though others also come to take the stage, in this book she is up there front and center.The series is also a commentary on and critique of C. S. Lewis's The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe series, which Pullman, an atheist, found as he finds all Christian theology, too simplistic about the nature of the universe. Pullman once commented that he finds it interesting that he is placed in the category of \"fantasy\" writer, which he thinks is dismissive and evidence of the narrowness of vision that dominates the planet: fact and fantasy. In other words, Pullman sees the world as multiple, not binary, not just good and evil, Heaven and Hell; he thinks there are multiple worlds, and he thinks science/physics increasingly supports what many people know about the presence of multiple spiritual realms. Pullman is also widely castigated/denounced as critical of The Holy Roman Catholic Church, which seems to be true in my reading of this book, though I think he is critical of almost all religions that see the world narrowly and are bound up in a view of the world as comprised of Sinners and Saints. Pullman especially finds the notion of Original Sin, which is the very foundation of the Dutch Calvinist Reformed Church in which I grew up, reprehensible, certainly limiting as a foundation for life. I think the Catholic Church, seeing Pullman as an atheist and his work as an exclusively anticlerical tract, may have helped to crush the continuation of the fine film series, which only has one third of the story, focused on this book, produced, though that film was tame compared to the book. But I think the series is more about the nature of True Religion than anti-religion, and Pullman says as much himself.The series also owes a lot to Milton's Paradise Lost, which will become more evident as the series goes along, though you don't need to have read that work to appreciate the tales. Pullman loves Milton, and also argues with him, too. As with Warner Brothers cartoons, there's a kid level and an adult level on which you can appreciate the wonder of the tales. But it's not just a fantasy adventure! As with all great literature, it's about what is at stake in making meaning. It's a great classic.But enough about all that theology jazz! Lyra is the hero of this first volume (and ultimately of the whole series). She is a liar (Pullman pronounces her name Lie-rah), a storyteller, fantasist, without which she could literally not survive. We named our daughter after this main character, so you know I am a fan, though we pronounce the name Lee-rah (as in Lyrical).", "num_likes": 109, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["children", "fantasy"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3077029", "review_id": "3077029", "date": "Jul 14, 2007", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Oceana2602", "user_url": "/user/show/177596-oceana2602", "text": "This book was recommended to me somewhere in fandom as a children's book that is also interesting to adults. I admit that I wasn't particularly impressed with it, and I can't see it as something that I would give my kids to read. My main complaint is the \"means to an end\" style the author uses. A bit like in a computer game, our main character Lyra runs from one wise man to another in her quest to find some missing children. This is practical, because except for one scene in the beginning, she doesn't have to find out things herself, since the wise men will always tell her wat to do and what is going on in long, question-answer dialogues which will reveal the next part of the plot. Nothing is ever really set up to lead somewhere, unlike for example in Harry Potter where everything leads to something in the end, everything is happening in dialogue, which sounded so constructed and goal-oriented that it rarely ever convinced me.The narrator is probably supposed to be an all-knowing narrator (sorry, don't know the english term for that), but he slips into Lyra's POV with no pattern I could discover. And the fact that I even noticed this shows how disturbing it was. The protagonist is, well, I don't know why anyone writing children's book would invent an \"unimaginative\" (quote), lying, sometimes even hateful character like Lyra. I started to like her a bit more during the second half of the book, but mostly because I felt sorry for her. Then I discovered that she is supposed to be older than 11, when she makes herself younger by telling someone that she is eleven. Until the I had thought she was maybe 8 or 9. Shortly after that I stopped reading the book.P.S.: After having read numerous other reviews of this book, I feel the need to point out that I'm an atheist and that no, I didn't give this book a bad review because it \"offended my christianity\". In fact, I seem to be so much an atheist that I completely missed how the book could be controversial or offensive in that regard. I know it offended me by being a bad book sold with a lot of hype, but that's not Pullman's fault. However, I did read that Pullman called himself an agnostic somewhere, and that explains rather a lot to me.

The gobblers and the separations were very dark. Kidnapping children and then essentially separating them from their best friend and their soul would make lots of kids sad and scared. The book was also surprisingly gory. There was a whole long, detailed passage about people cutting holes in their heads and the polar bear fight was very graphic. The details of the jaw flying off and then ripping out the polar bear\u2019s heart made me extremely nauseous.It explained what castration was toward the end of the book, too.

When I first read this back in late 2015, I listened to the full cast audiobook. It has great production and is really entertaining, but I didn't connect with the story. As a child, I never read this book, so in my head it was in the same realm of Narnia or Harry Potter, where readers have a special attachment to it for nostalgia's sake. I didn't have that, and because I also realized I don't get on well with fiction in audio format, I enjoyed the listen but it didn't blow me away.Then a couple years later the TV adaptation came out on HBO which I started watching and fell in love with. So I've always been curious about returning to this series, especially now as we wait for the 3rd and final season to arrive. When I stumbled on these books in a used bookstore and a Little Free Library near my home, it felt like fate\u2014time for me to pick them up again. And I'm so glad I did!I absolutely loved revisiting this fantasy epic. I think for me watching the show actually helped me with the re-read, since I had a visual connection to the world and also was better able to discern the various characters, their motives, and picture it all in my mind as I read it.Lyra, our hero, is truly one of the great protagonists of children's literature, or really any literature. Her journey is a true coming-of-age tale that is extremely fantastical and yet relatable at the same time. What happens when everything you thought you knew turns out to be false? How can you trust others when the ones you have trusted betray you? These, and many other questions, come up throughout the novel, all while we are taken on a fantastic adventure.I am super excited now to keep going in this series. I know some of what happens in book 2 because of the show, but after re-reading book 1 I can tell they kept as much as possible while adding in new elements or bringing plot points from later in the series to earlier episodes which I think was really smart.

He did a good job of gradually making Lyra less of an ignorant brat and more of a noble little savage girl. Overall, I liked this book well enough to want to read the second one in the trilogy, but I had several problems with it:-There was no comic relief or even any funny moments in this book. It took itself extremely seriously and was rarely light-hearted or playful. It bothers me when epic stories get a little bit too in love with a sense of their own epicness.-Roger is supposedly the protagonist's best friend and her motivation for doing everything she does in at least half of the book, and his death is supposed to be some significant turning point...yet he's by far the dullest, least developed, and least important character in the book. He says maybe 20 sentences in the entire novel and his longest continuous presence in the book is when he's asleep in a balloon. Time for Lyra to get a better, more interesting, best friend, which I assume happens in book 2.-The alethiometer is pretty damn hokey. It sounds like something Neville's grandmother would have given him in the HP series. It doesn't tell the truth so much as do the dirty work of plot exposition for Pullman. \"What's so-and-so doing?\" And then we get several paragraphs of background information and future predictions. Um, isn't that the kind of information that characters are supposed to figure out by being smart or making friends or discovering things on their own? On the other hand, if the alethiometer is indeed something marvelous and great, then why didn't Lyra use it all the time? There were a couple of times when she was wondering about something or needed a crucial bit of information, but she either chose not to consult the alethiometer or forgot about it. I'm sure that was intentional on Pullman's part, because it was a way for him to show Lyra messing up or figuring something out on her own. But if I had an alethiometer at my disposal, I'd be using it all the time, and there was no good reason why Lyra shouldn't have done that, too.-Lord Asriel's great \"betrayal\" was completely obvious to anyone paying attention and wouldn't have been very surprising even if you weren't expecting it. The fact is, he never came across as a \"good guy\" to me from the very beginning, if for no other reason than that he was a bastard to Lyra from the very first chapter. He obviously didn't give a flip about his daughter, so why shouldn't he betray her to get what he needed to satiate his ambition? Lyra was stupid to ever trust him in the first place. I'm hoping she acquires a little bit deeper faculty of character judgment in the next book.Despite my criticisms, it was an enjoyable book overall, and it's quite refreshing to read a children's fantasy story that still upholds virtues like bravery and sacrifice without resorting to the ideals and symbolism of Christianity. Pullman's writing is what really sold this book to me. The plot itself is nothing special and falls into the cliches/archetypes that most fantasy falls into, but Pullman is obviously more expert at the writer's craft than most children's authors, or even most fantasy authors, for that matter.", "num_likes": 61, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/571291487", "review_id": "571291487", "date": "Mar 26, 2013", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Bradley", "user_url": "/user/show/4213258-bradley", "text": "Re-read, 11/4/19:I think I might have been a bit unfair to the book in my original review.

When I finished it, I saw the interesting bits finally come alive. The writing is smooth and the characters, while rather one-sided and painted with broad strokes, works well here. I can't complain, because most book's characters rather fall into the same category and so I must focus on ideas and how those ideas are pulled off. The locales are charming, and even though we're missing some depth, it's to be expected by the type of the novel it is.

It is a truly fantastic story of not only self discovery where Lyra learns that she is capable of so much, that people are not what they seem so I guess she loses some of her childlike innocence. Lyra might be a wild savage but she is extremely clever. I love the idea of the d\u00e6mons. As a child your d\u00e6mon constantly changes but becomes fixed at puberty and is a representation of you and the bond is so strong that survival of one is dependent on the survival of the other.

I found elements that questioned Christianity and Catholicism and the nature of God and its works, but I also found elements that questioned parental authority, the ethical and practical roles of Science, and the nature of good and evil. And it is this consistent questioning that I see as the message of Pullman's first book of \"His Dark Materials\" -- not any of those messages that were focused on during the movie's release. The notion that we should question everything, even if we are children -- or especially if we are children -- is one of the most important messages humankind can hear, and one of the hardest for us to learn or employ. Most people simply do not want to question. It takes work; it takes struggle; it takes strength, and far more strength than unquestioning faith or simple acceptance require.The fact that Lyra questions everything around her at all times is her salvation. And ours if we would only learn the lesson. Say what you like about Pullman's story, but regardless of your religion or politics or economics or taste he does something brave that needs to be respected -- he challenges us to think about everything. Even his book (with its flaws...and there are a couple).I understand that he can't maintain the amazing level of The Golden Compass, nee Northern Lights, in the books that follow, but I am compelled to read them to see for myself.

Much has been said already about the originality of this novel, and a lot of criticism has (not always undeservedly) been shed on the character development. This book doesn't necessarily have to be classified as a children's fantasy novel - it can easily be enjoyed by teenagers, but also adults will likely be able to find a compelling story in here. That's the most powerful aspect a fantasy writer can choose to adopt for their stories, in my opinion: to be able to write something that can be classified as enjoyment, but also easily holds up for more demanding readerships seeking more intellectual elements. Pullman's exploration of the importance of science and religion in this first installment of the \"His Dark Materials\" series invites the reader on a journey through an interesting world filled with complex society dynamics.It's easy to see why this book has become so popular during the 1990s: it's a quintessential modern classic of the fantasy genre, and I am glad I finally decided to get over myself and give the genre another well-deserved chance.", "num_likes": 52, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["reviewed", "silvans-books", "own-paperback", "ya-fantasy", "epic-fantasy", "all-the-books-i-own", "read-2019", "year-1995", "fantasy", "audiobook-with-silvan"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3179059628", "review_id": "3179059628", "date": "Feb 11, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Lyn", "user_url": "/user/show/5253785-lyn", "text": "My first thought after reading was that this is NOT a children\u2019s book: young adult OK, but there were some violent scenes and some mature concepts for the little folk.Philip Pullman\u2019s 1996 classic draws us in to his exceptional world building with some heady theological undertones.

But this care-free life, and her childhood innocence along with it, is ripped from her one night when her explorations take her somewhere she shouldn't be and the recipient of knowledge her young ears should never have been privy to.I found as much joy within these worn pages as I did as a child, as the complexity of plot was enough to engage an adult reader whilst the action-packed adventures Lyra embarks on captivated my younger mind. It was only upon completing my reread and exploring other reviews that I understood this was a story created to promote Christianity. This was a slant I did not discover myself but seems obvious with hindsight. Just like with the Narnia series, this wasn't something that impacted my enjoyment and I found myself free to enjoy the story exactly as I approached it - as a fantastical and whimsical adventure.", "num_likes": 50, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["adventurous-acuity", "young-adult-books-read", "fantastic-fabrications", "science-fiction-sagacity"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1790997769", "review_id": "1790997769", "date": "Oct 22, 2016", "rating": 1, "user_name": "picoas picoas", "user_url": "/user/show/28709846-picoas-picoas", "text": "If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.My first Philip Pullman, and probably my last.

After all this is a YA novel. Pullman's suggestion is that children are not fully self-conscious until adolescence. This premise is nonsense, even for a book.

As in Rowling's series, the hero of The Golden Compass--Lyra, a pre-teen girl in Oxford, England--is plucked from her mundane existence to become supremely important to the fate of the living world. However, unlike the Potter series, The Golden Compass, immerses us immediately in political, religious, and cultural conflict as well. While the central character is indeed a child, which lands this title in the children's section, the themes and conflicts in the novel are often very adult, the action sometimes gruesome, and characters' behaviors and motivations quite complex. The sophistication of the story will be lost over children's heads.Nonetheless, the action will sustain.For children, The Golden Compass is the story of Lyra Belacqua's adventure to the arctic to rescue her friend Roger, who has been kidnapped by adults who run experiments on children. The story is set loosely in our world and in the past, but in Pullman's revision, every human being has a \"daemon\" that is a physical manifestation of that person's soul in the form of an animal that is psychically, or perhaps spiritually, connected to the person. The experiments involve the investigation into and hideous manipulation of that connection. Along the way, Lyra meets talking bears, flying witches, and much, much more.For adults, the novel asks questions about the relationship between religion and science. It explores political coercion and subterfuge. It examines class differences. And, to a very real degree, I think, it focuses on adult obsession with innocence and experience--both in a religious context and in a childhood/adolescence/adulthood context.The result of all of this is a multi-layered novel. It's fun, but also thought-provoking--and potentially scandalous. Do I recommend it? Yes. Fun and thoughtful: a novel vision.Would I teach it? Hard to say. Likely not. It's a wonderful and intricate piece of writing--some of the passages are beautiful and the content generates many talking points--but much of it feels too overtly didactic.Lasting impression: This is another magnificently realized escapist fantasy like the Harry Potter series.

In this \u201csteam-punk\u201d environment religion and science are alloyed in clever and interesting ways. For example, a mechanical bug is a flying machine with a trapped evil spirit as its energy source, and physics is called experimental theology. The protagonist of this trilogy is a pre-adolescent named Lyra Belacque. Lyra is a girl with a destiny, a feisty, clever child who lies almost reflexively to get what she wants. When Lyra\u2019s friend Roger is kidnapped she begins a series of adventures in hopes of rescuing him while also searching for her father in the frozen north lands. Along the way she enlists a novel cast of characters including; a giant armored polar bear, a band of water gypsies or \u201cgyptians,\u201d a tribe of Siberian witches, and a Texas Aeronaut. Eventually, Lyra meets up with Will, another budding adolescent with whom she travels across parallel worlds facing grave dangers and impossible odds, while gaining maturity and falling in first love. Throughout all three books Lyra is pursued by agents of the sinister and powerful church known as The Magisterium. In the principal world of HDM, each human has a constant animal companion called a daemon which is both friend and conscience. One\u2019s daemon symbolically reveals the essence of one\u2019s character. For example, Lord Azriel\u2019s snow leopard shows us his ferocious strength, while Mrs. Coulter\u2019s monkey is diabolically manipulative and cruel. HDM\u2019s villains are deliciously evil, dripping in cold malice or driven by hot hatred. And none of them seem more malevolent than Lyra\u2019s own parents. And even though Lyra is devoted to her parents, we don\u2019t like them because they are the most bloodthirsty and amoral characters in the story despite the author\u2019s insistence that the Magisterium and its Archangel patron are far worse. This story has lots of interesting and admirable minor heroes, but HDM\u2019s main heroes are characters which generally lack warmth. Lyra too is often amoral and Will is constantly distant, guilt ridden, and unapproachable. So even though the story tells us they are falling in love, and we want to believe it since we have all shared so much danger, yet it is still a poorly portrayed romance, barely budding in fact even if the narrator tells us it has already bloomed. In the end, the large cast of characters are very cleverly contrived but bloodless, and we are more likely to shed tears for a polar bear than a parent, and feel as much affection for a balloonist as for the young lovers themselves. So while Pullman deserves acclaim for his delightful inventiveness in cast and setting, the principle characterizations do not ring warm, nor true. But characterization is not the most popular aspect of children\u2019s fantasy. To most young readers this story is simply a fantastic adventure into adolescence. Despite it\u2019s mature themes, His Dark Materials is ultimately a children's book and both adults and children should be dazzled and delighted by the rich and imaginative texture of Pullman\u2019s fantasy, without paying too much attention to the author\u2019s bitter attacks upon religion. His Darker Materials: A 2nd Review for Overly Serious and Slightly Obsessive AdultsPhillip Pullman is one of England's most outspoken atheists who has expressed a desire to become the \u201canti-C.S. Lewis\u201d by weaving anti-Christian themes into his fiction. Even though most of the anti-Christian themes will not be obvious to a young audience, they may become overly tendentious to adult readers. For example, while C. S. Lewis\u2019s central character in his Narnia fantasy gives his life to save the world from evil before miraculously returning to life, Pullman\u2019s God does precisely the opposite. He disengages from his creation, retires, and after having been deposed by his Regent and imprisoned in a crystal cage he dies in an auto accident and is eaten by vultures. This may seem to be delightfully dark humor to the ardent atheist, but to most readers it will seem irrelevant to the story - just another ax ground down to the handle. What makes this supposed irony meaningless is that Pullman\u2019s God is utterly unrecognizable. He has none of the characteristics we associate with God except authority - and even that has been impossibly usurped. Pullman\u2019s cardboard God plays no role in the faith of the characters, nor the plot development, so most readers will not be terribly distressed by his ignominious demise because even though it is a gratuitously bitter aside, it is not really an attack on anyone we know. In 1996, Philip Pullman asserted that \"[t:]here are some themes, some subjects, too large for adult fiction; they can only be dealt with adequately in a children's book.\" While I am not sure I agree with Pullman, neither can I join those who accuse HDM of being too sophisticated for children. I think it is perfectly acceptable to texture a story with history, symbols, and language that are beyond the understanding of children, because they generally have a remarkable ability to ignore that which seems irrelevant. After all, young readers are used to living in a world which is so complex as to be indistinguishable from magic. My principal complaint with Pullman\u2019s work is not because he has embedded mature themes in a children\u2019s fantasy, but because those themes themselves have little integrity. They are mostly inconsistent, contradictory, and unilluminating. If they are as important as Pullman asserts, then they deserve better treatment than here.Lost ThreadsHDM sets up a variety of seemingly important elements which are lost or undeveloped. For instance, the central force driving the story is every faction's belief that Lyra has a crucial choice to make which will determine the fate of the multiverse. Yet whether she ever actually makes that choice is completely unclear. Similarly there is a much emphasized prophecy that Lyra will commit a \"great betrayal\" that will \"hurt her greatly,\" yet what actually happens is not clearly a betrayal and does not hurt her any more than her companions who make the same sacrifice. Indeed this \u201cbetrayal\u201d leads to greater power and freedom for herself and her dearest friend. The value and nature of the soul is a recurring question that seems to drive all of the characters, but its relation to the story is dropped. The relationship between free will and sin also underlies the story but then it either dissolves into a question of sentience or disappears altogether. The origin of sentience itself is a question asked but unanswered. It could be caused by tool use, which itself might be caused by intelligent dust. The issue remains unclear, except that the author is certain that sentience is definitely not God\u2019s doing.InconsistenciesBefore embarking on her adventure Lyra is given an alethiometer, a device which can omnisciently tell the truth but is very difficult to read. Lyra reads it instinctively because of the dust within her. She loses her reading ability as she matures, although in theory that is when she receives more dust. So the facts of the story contradict the premise of the golden compass itself. Later we learn that the self-conscious dust is what is apparently omniscient, though why this benevolent dust is not the ultimate deific moral authority is unclear. I suppose the atheist author might be reticent to create a dust-god when his avowed purpose is to debunk all gods.It is prophesied that Lyra will become Eve, but the way she eventually does this is to fall in silly, sweet, infatuous love like countless other budding adolescents. By falling in love, Lyra and Will supposedly reverse the spiritual/ecological disaster of \u201cdust exodus,\u201d though no one knows how. Nor do we learn why neither other people\u2019s love, nor the Mulefa\u2019s could attract the fleeing dust. The prophesied temptress who brings Lyra to this Eve-like decision, tempts her by recounting her own personal liberation from religion. Mary tells young Lyra that she left the church and stopped being a nun during a business conference when she kissed an Italian man and felt sexual desire. She then happily left her vows, and became free to love, and be fulfilled instead of being alone. Of course she admits she did not marry him, nor the man she lived with for 4 years subsequent because even though she became free to not be alone like a nun, she learned that in fact she doesn\u2019t need men, and she is happier alone as a non-nun. In the end, it is utterly unclear how this tale of liberation from consistency, commitment and genuine love can possibly awaken Lyra\u2019s desire for Will. After all, we readers saw the signs of first-love coming five hundred pages before ever hearing Mary\u2019s tale of self-deceiving liberation. So while Lyra is to become Eve after yielding to temptation, the temptation is unclear, the yielding is unclear, and the effect is unexplained. By failing to truly show Lyra\u2019s significance and destiny, the driving force of the whole story is lost.It was also prophesied that because of Lyra, death should cease. In the first place, Pullman\u2019s death is imprisonment in a \u201csuper-dungeon of the soul\u201d made by God to make both good and bad souls miserable forever. In the second place, because of Lyra death didn\u2019t really cease. People still die. But now, imprisoned spirits can escape to the surface and dissolve into nature. Even if you see blessed oblivion as a step up from the awful spirit prison, it is hardly an end to death. Though Lord Azriel admits indifference to his daughter, he makes a sudden turn-around to protect her in the final climactic battle, though he doesn\u2019t know why, and neither do we except that now another prophecy may somehow be fulfilled. Lyra\u2019s mother likewise sacrifices herself to overthrow the Archangelic Authority. Thus she too is redeemed from being demonic throughout the story, because even though both parents are arrogant, vicious child murderers, at least they have the eventual moral fortitude to rebel against the even worse malevolence of the Church. To me the parents final redemption and demise is inexplicable, and not at all touching. Preaching the New ReligionHDM is dripping with bitterness against religion as can be seen by its numerous jabs at the Catholic church. But Pullman also attacks institutional religion in general by asserting that God should not have won the war in heaven. HDM posits an heroic anti-authoritarian resistance to the tyranny of heaven, and suggests we would all be better off with a \u201cRepublic of Heaven.\u201d But the heavenly war was not fought over the choice of Kingdom or Republic. Satan\u2019s alternative to God\u2019s benevolent kingdom was an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship. And because Lord Azriel, Pullman's Promethean voice of reason against the Church, is as arrogant as Lucifer and excuses the ample blood on his hands, we have every indication that his \u201cRepublic of Heaven\u201d would be no more free than any other police state set up by 20th century intellectual revolutionaries seeking a better world, only to create dystopia. Moral relativism is another great theme given insipid treatment in HDM. Toward the end of the story, one of the main characters spends several pages asserting that though his own morality is different from God\u2019s version, it is every bit as valid. I think Pullman unintentionally shows here that it is very difficult, perhaps impossible, to show the moral superiority of a moral-relativist. The author shows poor judgment by commending profligacy in a children\u2019s book by treating the free and uninhibited sexual relations of witches and men as a positive thing, and by applauding Mary\u2019s promiscuity. He even encourages a physical relationship between the two pre-teen heroes (though some passages were excised in the US edition).Pullman\u2019s story includes several other religious heresies. For instance, the notion that beings with bodies are more powerful than beings of spirit only, and that there exists in the universe elementary particles of intelligence. He also suggests that the only true spirituality is self-awareness, and that the fall of Adam and Eve was brought about for a good purpose. Because these controversial ideas are consistent with my own unorthodox form of Christianity, I have no objection to including them in a speculative fiction, though I can\u2019t help suspecting that they were employed principally to aggravate the religiously orthodox. His Golden ConclusionPullman\u2019s fantasy is so very inventive and clever, it almost compensates for being ideologically pretentious and fragmented. I recommend the reader ignore the philosophizing. It doesn't go anywhere and it doesn't actually impact the stories in the ways it seems like it should. In the end too many of the pieces don\u2019t fit together, and Pullman\u2019s grand themes end up not being so grand. But for the most part that is OK because few children care much about the large themes, and those adults who do care ought to lighten up or go elsewhere.", "num_likes": 36, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1673867220", "review_id": "1673867220", "date": "Jun 20, 2016", "rating": "", "user_name": "Jan-Maat", "user_url": "/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "text": "Well.First IntroductionAny book that has Jean Calvin becoming Pope & moving the seat of the papacy to Geneva would have to go out of its way to win my displeasure.Second IntroductionLooking out of the window of an aeroplane on to the topside of the clouds I have imagined that they were a great wildness of snow and that I was some great bear leaping through it.

Bad is not quite the right word, if you have read The Big Sleep then you'll have noticed that the narrative is impelled by somebody coming through a door with a gun in their hand, and when ever entropy threatens to take over Chandler cranks up the story by having another person walk in with a gun in their hand. This story is similar. After a while the narrative is maintained by dramatic escapes! Terrifying captures! Near disasters! Battles! Fighting! Another Battle! More fighting! Battles with Zeppelins! Battles with Zeppelins, witches and Tartars! None of this is bad, and I enjoyed it all hugely, but maybe it is unsophisticated, it gave me the sense of a writer not confident enough in the characters and the creation to sustain narrative flow with out explicit drama.This starts out as an Oxford novel, and so what I want to say next is Alice in Wonderland. Carol was a mathematician and a clergyman, amongst other things, his heroine moves into other worlds that intersect ours in ways unclear, and his relationship to his heroine is also unclear. We have eaten of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, are aware of our nakedness, and now are suspicious of Victorian clergymen who liked taking photographs of naked pre-pubescent girls.To my mind Pullman has grasped all those elements and recombined them, with added Milton (view spoiler)[or possibly subtracted since we're thinking of Paradise Lost (hide spoiler)] and William Blake, to create a powerful story - even without the armoured bears. There is the many worlds theory from physics, puberty, good and evil and our human conceptions of good and evil, the Church, these mingled together make an adventure that if you close your eyes to witches, Zeppelins, talking bears, dramatic captures and escapes, is strongly intellectual in flavour. And if you want to lure a child into wondering why Prague might be a good choice for the invention of a hand held quantum mechanical consciousness and reality interface device, what Zoroastrianism was all about, or over determinism and free will, then perhaps the sugar hit of the dramatic is just the thing.Going back to the children's literature of the beginning of the twentieth century the family was central to the story. The parents had to be disposed of (occasionally non-fatally) for the duration of the story, but then from Narnia to the Lake District, via Neverland glancing in at the Railway Children we are in a world of siblings. This was the world the child auditor, and probably more importantly any adult reader or potential purchaser of the book, was meant to identify with. Here the family is dysfunctional. The child has no siblings. The kinship group has been replaced by a playground dynamic in which the leadership capabilities of the heroine play out in small what those of her parents do in the macrocosm, with one difference. The child is prelapsarian. Her parents behaviour in contrast is not characterised by innocence but rather by cruelty or at best a preparedness to use others as tools to achieve their own ambitions. Potentially at this stage of the story we are at the beginning of a discussion of nature and nurture, we see the wisdom and kindness of other people influencing the child in loco parentis - the world is the true school of the individual in this vision. Similarly something that I liked was how Pullman mentioned details whose meaning would be clear to an adult reader - for example how an old man referred to the Witch whose life he had saved when he was young - but which would be meaningless for both a child reader and the central character. It is a book open to multiple perspectives and that holds within it the double vision of both a child's and an adult's eyes.At the close of this volume a great bridge is created from their world into a parallel universe - and here I remember at the close of book II of paradise Lost Satan struggling out from Hell across the void while behind him follow Sin and Death building a mighty highway to Earth Let me see how many days it will be before I follow them over into the next volume.", "num_likes": 36, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["british-isles", "fantasy", "20th-century", "fiction", "childrens-ya"]}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2132649021", "review_id": "2132649021", "date": "Oct 02, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Ivan", "user_url": "/user/show/31294609-ivan", "text": "Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars but I'm leaning more towards 4.This was fun read.

The protagonist is a young ophaned girl who's been raised at Oxford by the attending scholars. The story concerns kidnapped children, hidden mysteries of the Church, wandering gypsies, proud Arctic warrior bears, long-lived flying witches, and the possibility of a rift that could exist between different worlds.Daemons: Each human being in this world has a constant animal companion, called a daemon, which is a separate living being, but more or less an external projection of their emotions and their soul. Before puberty, a daemon is able to change shape at will, but as you grow older, it takes a fixed form, usually opposite to your gender. The bond between human and daemon is incredibly intimate and if harm should befall one, the other will surely suffer and eventually die.Other races in the world have unique expressions of their soul: The Tartars that live in the Arctic seem to favor wolf daemons, and they also engage in trepanation, so that they may hear the \"Voice of God\". The panserbj\u00f8rne, a race of noble, sentient polar bears with opposable thumbs, create their souls in the form of armor, which they craft from star-iron (meteorite). The witches of the North live the equivalent of several lifetimes, and although they favor avian daemons, they can be physically parted from them and not feel the pain of the distance. They sometimes use their daemons as agents. Themes: The themes that jumped out at me are questions of truth and deception, as well as what is the value and nature of the soul. Lyra has in her possession the ultimate tool for questioning the universe, a symbol reader (which is never referred to as a 'golden compass' btw) that universally answers her questions. Despite that, she's a person that lies almost reflexively to achieve her goals and try to control the behavior of people.As for the nature of the soul, we see the Church has a very distinct view of original sin, and an agenda they are actively pursuing. We're given a retrospect of several cultures (see Daemons above) and how each of them views the concept of their spirit, and especially with the witches, the cost of living too long. Assessment: One character that did a great job of entertaining me while simultaneously bugging the shit out of me is Lord Asriel. He's seen as haughty, even in the beginning, but there's something about this guy that you want to like. My problem with him is that he seems to act like he thinks he's the protagonist of the novel, and what's more, when he actually runs into the protagonist again, later in the book, he dismisses her. I haven't read Books 2 and 3 yet, so I don't know what's ahead for Lord Asriel, but I know that I want to punch him in his self-righteous, it's all about me, junk with a roll of quarters. I expect they'll probably try and make him a little more pleasant in the film, but I don't know.  About the Author: Phillip Pullman is one of England's most outspoken atheists, a supporter of the British Humanist Association and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. Frankly, I didn't see much of the anti-Church stuff until near the last section of the book, but when you do come across it, it's pretty clearly defined. Being an atheist myself, I don't have a problem with any of it since he uses real world examples (such as the castrati) to argue his reasons, and lots of \"enfs justifying the means\". I have to say though that if Lord Asriel is Pullman's Promethean voice of reason against the Church, he certainly has plenty of blood on his own hands, and he weakens his argument by making him a prick.", "num_likes": 34, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_id": "24963101-northern-lights", "book_title": "Northern Lights", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/711355117", "review_id": "711355117", "date": "Sep 04, 2013", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Eliza", "user_url": "/user/show/17568354-eliza", "text": "It's interesting how I rated this book 3-stars years ago, figured it was too low this year and reread the book, only to give it three stars again.
