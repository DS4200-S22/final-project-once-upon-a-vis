It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with clich\u00e9.3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing.5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is \"Men Who Hate Women\" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a \"good guy\" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a \"good guy.\" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Clich\u00e9, smich\u00e9! Yes there's some clich\u00e9 -- maybe plenty of clich\u00e9 -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about clich\u00e9 in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about \"pinko sympathies\" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerstr\u00f6m drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), gl\u00f6gg, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.

I realize that\u2019s a bit of a broad generalization and it sounds a bit rude, but I don\u2019t care. Because more often than not, I\u2019m nuts too.I was born and raised in Minnesota, and if you know our state history, you\u2019re already aware that we were predominantly settled and populated by Swedish (and Norwegian) immigrants. So not only are many Minnesota residents of Scandinavian descent, myself included, a lot of our quirky mannerisms and even our accents are commonly attributed to this influence. I attended a Swedish Lutheran college (which attracted a lot of Swedish exchange students). And one of my oldest and dearest friends is an American by birth but was raised in Sweden and didn\u2019t return to live full-time in the U.S. until she was 18. She\u2019s always found Minnesotans to be a very interesting form of science experiment\u2014what happens when you mix Swedish and American culture anyway? Taking what I know firsthand of Minnesota culture into consideration, I can only assume that Sweden, aka the motherland, is also a twisted place of dark, dry humor. Some mainstream examples that support this claim would include: Fargo, Drop Dead Gorgeous, A Prairie Home Companion and yes, even Mr. Purple Rain himself, who even though he\u2019s genetically a bit more exotic than a plain old Swede, definitely displays some of the more oddball (but typical) Minnesota traits in his own special way. The point being, the characters in this book felt oddly familiar to me, quirks and all. I\u2019m actually a bit surprised I loved the book as much as I did because I normally criticize authors for trying to jam too much into one story and this book had a lot going on:--shady business dealings--corporate fraud--murder--religious fanaticism--extramarital affairs--Nazis--casual sex--creepy pervs--violence against women--money laundering--sexual sadism--political proselytizing--dysfunctional family secretsAnd that\u2019s just scraping the surface. Because once Larsson got into it and started digging deeper into the plot and revealing more details, my head started spinning and I had smoke coming out of my ears. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be sucked in so quickly by the plot and am still reeling over the fact that this brick-like book (my copy has nearly 600 pages) went as quickly as it did. I just reserved the sequel from the library and am also excited at the prospects of a third. I\u2019m also sad that Mr. Larsson passed away. What a talented author\u2014not many could tie so much crazy shit into one story and still have it make sense AND be entertaining. Although I think whoever decided to change the title when they released this book in English is nuts too. The original Swedish title, Men Who Hate Women, is much more fitting.

Amazon pushed it on me for weeks, and the minute I stepped into Borders an employee ran over and recommended it. Thinking, this really better be the best book I've ever read, I took it up to the checkstand, where the register guy asked: \"Did one of our employees recommend this?\" Um, yeah. And Amazon, too. So of course I asked him why. \"Oh,\" he replied, \"we've been told to recommend it this week.\" That should have tipped me off right there: recommendations handed down by management. Pfft. I hesitate to suggest a conspiracy, but - did someone end up with too many of these in a warehouse in Duluth? Did Oprah make a bet with someone that she could pull strings and make the most boring book in the world a best seller?But I am suckered in by numerous good reviews and a fairly interesting book jacket description, so I buy it and take it with me on a trip camping with my family. Of course it totally sucks. I'm kicking myself because I feel like I really should have known. But the reviews - ALL the reviews - are absolutely positive from generally reliable sources, so I just DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND.Here's why I don't like it: I am about a third of the way into it, and literally hundreds of characters have been introduced. NOT ONE of them has done anything interesting, so I am finding it nearly impossible to keep them straight. I am the type that will be more or less satisfied reading the back of a cereal box, but this is BAD. I mean bad. The mystery is dull. The who done it is more like a who cares. The two primary characters are so far not very likable at all - in fact, the review descriptions are more interesting than the book descriptions of them. I'm betting part of the problem is the translation, presumably - but god, there is just some boring writing in here, too. \"He went to the store. He bought milk. He was cold. He went home.\" - BOR-RING! I am not really exaggerating, either. Actual content:\"He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches. He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food. he offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst. After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack.\"Again, I'm willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt with the translating, but I wouldn't have gotten out of high school writing with that kind of boring and utterly pointless description. It sets the tone of \"lonely dude being lonely\" but really: two sandwiches? why two? sausage and liverwurst - fascinating.That's really just a page I opened to randomly - there is much worse. I am truly bitterly resentful of every minute I am stuck on the side of this mountain without a good book to read. I'm ready to browse the mini mart down the way and read the real estate magazines instead.

And I must say that I liked feeling that way about her. That means that she has some sort of wilderness in her personality that makes her so interesting, not only as a character but also as a possible real-life person.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo made me ascend through different stages while reading it. I rarely find a book like this one, to make me feel all sorts of feelings towards it, from all the levels of human sensitivity in thinking. If I\u2019d have to layer the stages of my process of reading this book, probably it would go like this:1)\tLevel 1: Confusion \tI was extremely confused with the beginning. I think I had to read it at least five times to actually get a grip of the story in the beginning. Maybe it is because I was briefly introduced in the middle of a scene with unknown characters and undiscovered plot. I don\u2019t know, but I had a hard time with it anyway.2)\tLevel 2: Boredom \tI\u2019ve had a hard time convincing myself that this book deserves to be read because of the epic state of boredom that I encountered. I spent two hours reading without stopping only to find out I\u2019ve made only 4% progress (yes, I read it on my tablet because I don\u2019t have enough finances to buy all the books I want and also survive as a student who is away from home and also likes to eat). I kept asking myself what was this bug of boredom that I had and then\u2026it hit me. TOO MUCH ECONOMIC TALK. As a student at the Academy of Economic Studies, my interest should\u2019ve been aroused. Even more \u2013 as I study Business Administration, all the business talk should be some delicious dessert for me. But NA-AH. I am bored enough by the countless hours of business terminology, ideology and any other \u2013ology that shit implies, I don\u2019t need to read about it in my spare time too. But hey, why not creeping some of that ish in my casual reading to keep the brain on its right track of self-destruction, ceteris paribus?3)\tLevel 3: Spark of interest \tAfter about 100 pages (I reckon even more) something started working for me. The mystery started to crawl at the surface so I could see and touch it and also expect more and more. Then, the author added some interesting family dirt (that I absolutely love, don\u2019t judge me, I have a weird family too, amazingly weird, if I may add, but still weird) and also some World War 2 references (all these besides the actual mystery of Harriet Vagner\u2019s disappearance and also possible murder). I don\u2019t know what happened from that moment on, but it started being good. Like really good. It\u2019s just\u2026you can feel the mystery, especially because the book gives you almost 0.1 details about the possible murder. Your inner Miss Marple must be intrigued. Mine was for sure. 4)\tLevel 4: Outrage and disgust  \tSince now, I haven\u2019t talked much about the eponym of the book, right? Well, let me talk then. \nLisbeth Salander\n. And the surely nauseous manner in which she was treated. How do you expect anyone with at least a bit of empathy and humanity not to be OUTRAGED and DISGUSTED by the rape scenes which Lisbeth has been put through? It is absolutely indisputable, morally wrong and socially disgraceful. I am going to be very mean and very direct and I am going to ask a question: What level of psychical constipation do you need to have to pursue such an abominable act? Yeah, those passages made me very sick. And very sad. Truly. I felt nauseous after all. But then\u20265)\tLevel 5: \u2018She\u2019s a f-ing genius-arse boss and I\u2019m here for it\u2019 \tLisbeth Salander is a bloody queen and you can\u2019t make me change my mind even with an AK-47 glued on my temple. She\u2019s ice cold, but she\u2019s breathing fire. She\u2019s the fool of the village, but she\u2019s the hero of the nation. She\u2019s invisible, but she\u2019s not transparent. The way she seems not to care about anything that may interfere with her principles and also the way she cares about things but never speak them up is just so her, so part of the true individual she is, even though she might look unrealistic constructed. You do you, girl. You do you.The fact that, until the middle of the book, Salander and Blomkvist didn\u2019t meet and also \u2018the girl with the dragon tattoo\u2019 was reduced only to a few scenes made me question my reading choice. I was on board only for Salander, because she captured my interest from the first time she appeared in scene. But then, Pippi Longstocking and Kalle Blomkvist merged together and gave life to this fabulous Swedish detective dream team and I was down for it. Talking about the characters of the book, the female characters were such badass women it felt so good reading about them (super businesswomen taking over multinational companies? Yeah, okay, sign me up). I couldn\u2019t feel any real connection towards the male characters however, except for Mikael Blomkvist. Even though he is a lousy father and husband and he has some shaky ethics in life, he is definitely a good man by his nature. Yes, he has his own issues, but who doesn\u2019t? Yes, he was having a not so secret love affair with his best friend and business partner, Erika Berger, but as long as they didn\u2019t make a secret out of it and people in their lives accepted it, I can\u2019t say that it is that punishable. And, also, because we are still on the topic: Erika Berger. I absolutely loved her. She is a witty businesswoman, with a lot of gut and a lot of cold blood to make decisions and to run her own world. She\u2019s a strong woman who makes her own living out of her own life and enjoys it as it is, never letting anyone getting to her with some second-hand crap.But. The most important character of all, the one that I absolutely loved beyond any other character is\u2026ladies and gentlemen\u2026*drum rolls*\u2026yes, you're right, Lisbeth Salander! I can\u2019t tell you why I feel this way about Salander, but she was my absolute favourite since the very first moment I met her. The passive way that she adopted, the cold feelings that she spread, the taciturn nature and her absolutely killer mind just had me on board. Everyone saw Salander as a victim of society, but I felt that was wrong. I have never had that feeling about her. She always inspired me survival. She was a fighter by nature and fighters always survive. And this is how Salander made her way through life. Also, let\u2019s be honest now, she has a killer T-Shirt taste, like seriously badass (see \u2018Armageddon was yesterday, today we have a serious problem\u2019 and \u2018I can be a regular bitch. Just try me\u2019).In conclusion, this book gave me such a hard time I cannot explain, but it was also a really good book that I might consider as one of my own personal favourites. Also, as a side note: has anyone notice how much coffee do those people drink?? Or is just me?All in all people, good reading!

Women know that if we walk alone in the dark, statistically there is a good chance we will get raped. If we go to the wrong party, we\u2019ll be raped. If we misread that boy next door and his swellness is a con, rape. And when a person is in a position of being systematically controlled, it often does cause more physical or emotional damage to fight back. It\u2019s not right, but it is realistic. It seems to me like it is the equivalent of every man being raised that if he leaves the house at the wrong time, he might encounter a woman who will strip him naked, hold him down, and knee him in the balls while she masturbates. And then in this alternate universe, these boys find out, as they grow up, that most of the men they know have had that happen to them. And I\u2019m not trying to minimize sexual assault experiences that involve little or no physical injury, nor am I trying to minimize sexual assaults against men: no one has the right to touch another person\u2019s body without permission. I\u2019m talking about the way women are raised to think of daily life. Women are not raised to be afraid we\u2019re going to get a super hot BJ that we didn\u2019t realize we wanted, which is sometimes how I feel people talk about rape accusations. We are raised to encounter our daily lives knowing that, even if violence wasn't in our past, violence probably is in our future. And every time someone says, \u201cDon\u2019t go alone,\u201d it is a little reminder that a lot of men hate us.I have to say, though, that while I think it is realistic to say that women are raised to fear rape and to incorporate that fear of rape into our daily routine, and that sometimes fighting back makes things more dangerous, I do not believe it is effective to live in fear or to encourage women to live in fear or not defend ourselves. I think that perpetuates an idea that women are powerless, which then encourages women to freeze up when encountered with violence or even conflict. I think trusting our instincts and learning martial arts is probably more productive. And teaching men not to rape.That seems like the approach this book takes, though it more directly simply reflects, with appropriate outrage, on the levels of male contempt for women. And I think in that way, in the way it is directed to men, it is about how gross contempt for women is, whether it takes the form of self-absorption or sadism.This book is smart. It is symmetrical in its execution in many ways: in starting and ending with Blomkvist\u2019s corporate corruption story, and in the way it shows men and women accused of race whoring, men and women subjected to violence. The juxtaposition of (view spoiler)[Salander\u2019s rape with Blomkvist\u2019s consensual sexual encounter with Cicilia (hide spoiler)] is really well played. It is viscerally grotesque in the contrast, and it highlights the theme of consent. It was physically difficult for me to read, especially in the contrast, and I thought that made it very effective.Salander\u2019s character, too, is smart. She is both the outcast that women are when we fight back, and she is something of the misunderstood-bad-boy hero turned girl. I liked that. When she (view spoiler)[saves Blomkvist, it is all really vivid and heroic, but still corporeal and disgusting. I liked that Blomkvist couldn\u2019t take charge because he was in too much shock, and that she truly saved his life (hide spoiler)]. It bothers me when a storyteller starts to let a girl save a guy, but really she only tosses him the gun to save himself. Salander gets some real action and some real credit, and it is satisfying. Ultimately, it is pretty clear, but not laughing in your face, just resigned, Larsson knows (view spoiler)[Blomkvist is a self-serving ass, too. It was so smart at the end when Blomkvist runs into his nemesis with a girl Salander\u2019s age on his arm, and Blomkvist so despises him for it. I like how in the end our hero really isn\u2019t our hero. He really has only used Salander, and how far is that from hating women? It is certainly not respectful (hide spoiler)]. The hatred we condemn in this book, though, manifests as violence, and I can get behind featuring that and then fading out to Cicilia\u2019s father condemning her as a whore and Blomkvist\u2019s blissful self-absorption. It is a meaningful gradation. But, it is important that (view spoiler)[Blomkvist isn\u2019t the ideal model of men being friends with women because he would be too specific \u2013 because there probably isn\u2019t an ideal model. Larsson doesn\u2019t justify Blomkvist\u2019s assholery, but he is not so in love with his hero that he can\u2019t acknowledge it (hide spoiler)]. And, aren\u2019t we all assholes to each other a lot of the time? But not all of us get off on kneeing each other in the balls.This struck me as a very masculine translation of male hatred of women and the way women navigate a world that tells us every time we turn a corner that it hates us. It seems like men either have considered what life would be like if they had been trained to fear leaving the house after dark, or they haven\u2019t. And in my experience, it is difficult for men to understand a woman\u2019s words if she tries to describe it, so I think it is important to have a man tell a story this way. I do see how the graphic descriptions of sadistic violence against women might allow a sadistic audience to read only for that, but the fact that Larsson balances this with graphic violence against men neutralizes the gender-hatred aspect of that to me. And if you are reading these books for the violence, see a psychiatrist, but I don\u2019t think it is productive to censor descriptions of violence just because someone fucked up might get off on them. And if you think these descriptions are fantastical exaggerations, go spend some time at your local women\u2019s shelter. Unfortunately, I think you will find you are wrong. And I don't think it does anybody any good to be afraid to tell these stories.I hated the writing in this book a lot. Like, I hated it a lot. It both hit a lot of pet peeves of mine and it was just objectively bad in a lot of places. I don\u2019t have a problem with books being badly written if the writing doesn\u2019t get in the way of a good story, but here the writing was waiving its hands in my face the whole time trying to get me to lose the story. The sandwiches! OH TEH SANDWICHES! I wonder how much tourism for Sweden Larsson drummed up by the sandwich descriptions. I hope none because gag. I can see how he created the effect of an investigatory report through the writing, so, I think it is intentionally the way it is, but it was a choice I did not enjoy at all. So, overall this was a very unpleasant book to read, but it was smart, and its smartness outweighed its unpleasantness in my evaluation.It is always kind of a funny experience to read your own words as someone else would write them. In every Willa Cather novel I have read, there has been a moment where I\u2019ve read something and thought, \u201cI just said that last week!!!\u201d It was funny in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: I wanted to high five Salander all the time because I would think her dialogue right before I read it. I imagine everyone in the world has told me to read this book because of the times I say, \u201cOh, another man who hates women.\u201d Or that it is bullshit to say someone had a violent childhood, so of course he had to be violent against women as an adult. So, it was funny to read somebody else say those words. At the same time, Salander felt like a man recording the facts of what he saw a woman do and say once, not like a living, breathing human character. That doesn\u2019t take away from the smartness of the book, but it is another reason my actual enjoyment factor was low.Also, I had to go buy pickles yesterday because reading about so many of them gave me a craving. I hope Larsson\u2019s estate got some sponsorship money from the sandwich and pickle lobbies.

The entire book sets you up to think that the alleged killing/s were perpetrated by one or more people for complicated reasons. Spoiler: They're not. A murderer, at the climax, reveals, \"I like killing [people].\" That's the motive. That's it. 2. The title character has her macabre past detailed at length. The salient facts to the case - how did she come into possession of her detective-ing skills? - is left out entirely. Her emotional life is ignored until it's needed for a little plot development and then ignored again for a gazillion pages. She makes Kinsey Milhoney look like a guru of emotional awareness and self-knowledge.3. When a MAJOR DEVELOPMENT happens in the case, like, THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENT, we the readers hear about its resolution third hand. A reunion occurs and we are not privvy to it, even though it's REALLY IMPORTANT. That is LAME.4. Stop with the Mac commericials aleady. Is it possible that the well-financed campaign for this book had to do with the fact that the dead author couldn't object to selling Apple and Kawasaki shout-outs?5.The two plot lines are almost entirely unrelated. They don't even intersect, really; one segues into a second, and then, when the second is wrapped up entirely, the first plot returns to end with a whimper. 6. There is a Lot of torture-porn in this book. Did I mention that? Detailed description of sexual abuse, incest, and general nastiness that does nothing to advance the plot. Really. It just takes up space making you think there are reasons for the murders, but ...no, see #1. We listened to this on cd and I kept trying to forward and ending up on the absolute worst moments. Blech.7. Several passages written as an email conversation. It's like the author realized at a certain point that he was so bad at dialogue that he'd better just give it a rest for a while and instead use stilted telegraph talking. 8.

Which is not to say that the book wasn't enjoyable and exciting; it just didn't knock my socks off whilst simultaneously blowing my mind and rocking my world. (that sounds like either some great song lyrics or a very complicated sexual maneuver. Let's go with the first option.)So, the good stuff: the main story - a disgraced journalist is hired by a rich old man to write a book about said man's crazy rich family, while secretly working to discover truth behind the disappearance and supposed murder of the man's granddaughter. Also in play is Lisbeth Salander, a freelance investigator who also happens to be one of the best hackers in Sweden. She also happens to be made of awesome, but I'll get to that later. The journalist is investigating a supposed murder (a body was never found, so no one even knows what happened to the girl), so violence is expected. I just wasn't quite prepared for just how intensely graphic the violence is. There's a lot of stuff dealing with assault, rape, and murder of various women. There is also a lot of sex in the book, and the stuff that gets described in the most detail is definitely not consensual and will probably make you very uncomfortable. You've been warned. The investigation itself is pretty fascinating, implausible as it is that some random guy investigating a disappearance that took place 40 years ago was able to find out completely new leads that weren't found by the police or the girl's grandfather (who's been obsessing about the case since forever), but I digress. The family itself is equal parts interesting, creepy, and frustrating. It's not until the journalist (Blomkvist) teams up with Lisbeth that things get really interesting, and they made such a fun team I wanted them to get their own detective show. The book deals mainly with crimes against women and those who commit them. Larsson obviously feels very passionately about this subject, as well as what should be done with the men who assault women. Without giving anything away, rest assured that every bad guy rapist/murderer/whatever gets a large helping of tasty justice. And now for the bad stuff: -There's a lot of nattering on about business and computers and journalism and more business stuff that either bored me or went over my head completely. -Larsson cannot seem to decide whether he wants to refer to people by their last name or their first name, so he switches back and forth and it is confusing. -A family tree is provided at the beginning of the book, since the family the journalist is investigating (the Vangers) is pretty big, but I never had much trouble keeping everyone straight. A map of the island the family compound is located on would have been much more helpful, since I never really figured out the geography of the place. -Pointless details. I don't need to know what the characters ate for every single meal, I don't need to know exactly what model of computer/motorcycle/car a character uses, and I definitely don't need to know what each character is wearing at every moment of the day. Larsson is especially guilty of this when Lisbeth is concerned - I guess he decided we wouldn't understand what a unique counterculture tough chick she is unless we know that she's always wearing leather jackets, boots, torn jeans, and black t-shirts with angry slogans. (yes, Larsson actually tells us what each of Lisbeth's t-shirts says.) Listen, Stieg: Lisbeth is awesome. She is wonderfully defined simply through her own actions and thoughts - we don't even need the other characters constantly reminding us how antisocial and tough and uncommunicative and badass she is. Believe me, we can see that. Show don't tell etc. To sum up, I'm going to give the last word to the book itself, and quote a sentence that's actually a character talking about a book featured towards the end of the story - but it could easily describe Larsson's book:\"It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.\" That, in a nutshell, was how I felt about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.UPDATE: I just watched the film version of this book (the original Swedish one, thank you verra much), and am adding this to my \"the movie is better\" shelf. Not that the book isn't good; it's just that the movie streamlines the story and gets rid of everything I complained about earlier in this review. In the movie, all the minor characters and business-drama babble has been eliminated, Erika and Mikael's weird three-way relationship is thankfully unmentioned, Mikael never boffs Cecilia Vanger, and Noomi Rapace is so fucking cool as Lisbeth I can't even handle it. I'm also pretty sure they took some stuff from The Girl Who Played With Fire and put it in the movie, because there's some stuff about Lisbeth's past that I don't remember from the book. UPDATE UPDATE: Having now seen the American remake, and re-watched the Swedish version, I have come to a following decision. While the American version is, in a technical sense, a better movie (Fincher is a much better director - for just one example, the scene where Henrik Vanger explains the circumstances of Harriet's disappearance is a masterful example of show-don't-tell), I dislike the changes they made to the ending, and I simply cannot accept Rooney Mara as Lisbeth. Although I'm proud of Fincher & Co. for making her look and act as weird as the character should, something about her portrayal still wasn't right.

I have the movie trilogy box set of the books that are fan freaking tastic! Although, now I have to switch from dvd to blu-ray! I also have a couple of different copies of the books!

He ends up hiring Mikael Blomkvist to find out what happened. Then Mikael gets lucky to have Lisbeth help him. Do these two find out some secrets! Mikael almost gets killed a time or two. Makes you wonder what all they are hiding! And of course, it's a big ole nasty secret. Why am I not surprised. It was just as hard to read about the second time around. Of course, there were other scenes that I had to skim through again, but I digress. If you haven't wandered into the world that is Lisbeth Salander, what are you waiting for?

So here is the first warning to you, if you don't handle violence against women and children well, skip this novel. It's hard to give a short synopsis of the book. \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" starts off as an investigation of a 40-year old disappearance of a teenage heiress, but gradually morphs into a tale of serial murder and corporate trickery spanning several continents and later takes in complicated international financial fraud and the buried evil past of a wealthy Swedish industrial family.I found this book extremely engaging and full of action and came to regret many times that I had an audio version instead of a regular paper book. I also enjoyed immensely the amount details about everything - the publishing business, twisted Swedish family, corporate crime, history and political order of Sweden, etc. I am guessing if you don't care to read about any of this subjects, this book is not for you, because it is packed with this information.My only qualm about this book, a small one, was the characterization. The character of Mikael Blomkvist smelled of a male wish fulfillment fantasy, the one where a man is adored by all women, gets laid all the time and always gets lauded for his stellar bedroom skills. Lisbeth Salander also felt a little shaky and I thought Asberger's decease didn't quite account for her strange personality. I thought her antisocial behavior was inconsistent. This however didn't spoil my reading experience. I am eager to move on to \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\" and see what Mikael and Lisbeth are up to next.

Since so many people told me I just had to read it, many of them non-readers, I assumed it was a lot of over-hyped, dumbed-down crap. Well, I may have been wrong. All hype aside, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a damn good book and I feel it goes beyond just being a mystery.Larsson creates some memorable characters. We've got Mikael Blomkvist, the tarnished journalist, Lisabeth Salander, bad ass hacker, for the leads, both multidimensional characters. Neither are by any means perfect but I liked them just the same. The Vanger family and the staff of the Millennium aren't as well drawn as the leads but Ericka Berger and some of the Vangers are good characters in their own right.I'll be honest. It took a little while for me to get moving but I was enthralled pretty early on. You wouldn't have thought I'd be that interesting in what could have been a tedious subject to read about, namely researching family archives for hints. Somehow Larsson managed to grab me, though.There isn't a lot of violence but what there is is pretty brutal. The hacking was pretty well done and not completely unbelievable. I guess what really sold the book for me was that I really believed in the characters. Both of them are pretty flawed but completely believable.I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a some complaints. Aside from the pace, I felt like Larsson threw in some needless details. I didn't need to know the brands of a lot of products or what the characters were eating.

It is the first book of the Millennium series. In December 2002, Mikael Blomkvist, publisher of the Swedish political magazine Millennium, loses a libel case involving allegations about billionaire industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. Blomkvist is sentenced to three months (deferred) in prison, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Soon afterwards, he is invited to meet Henrik Vanger, the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporation, unaware that Vanger has checked into his personal and professional history; the investigation of Blomkvist's circumstances has been carried out by Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply troubled researcher and computer hacker. Vanger promises to provide Blomkvist with evidence against Wennerstr\u00f6m in return for discovering what happened to Vanger's grandniece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966 during a family gathering at the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island, when the island was temporarily cut off from the mainland by a traffic accident on the bridge. Blomkvist moves to the island and begins to research the Vanger family history and Harriet's disappearance. As he does so, he meets most of the remaining Vanger clan, including Harriet's brother Martin, current CEO of the company; Isabella, Martin and Harriet's mother; and Cecilia, a headmistress who was Harriet's younger aunt and friend. Meanwhile, Salander's legal guardian Holger Palmgrem suffers a stroke, and is replaced by Nils Bjurman, who uses his position to extort sexual acts from her and eventually rapes her. After using a hidden camera to record her assault, Salander takes her revenge, torturing Bjurman and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control of her life and finances. She then uses a tattoo machine to brand him as a rapist. ...\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646:

If you can handle that and the previous x amount of paragraphs and the following x amount of paragraphs, you're golden. If that sort of makes that thing in your throat rise up a little bit and make your mouth taste sour, you might reconsider reading this book.Carry on.I wasn't going to read this book, ever. But then I saw the theater up the street from me (a cool one that plays those indie and art films, and their popcorn is always sort of either stale or slightly burnt, and the employees all have an air of snootiness - it's one of my favorite places in town) is showing the foreign movie. My first thought was, \"When did they make a movie of this book?\" My second thought was, \"Dammit. I sort of want to see that movie.\" My third thought was, \"Sonsofbitches. I can't see it until I read it.\" (Yes, I'm hard on myself, thanks.) So last weekend when we went out of town I decided it was the best time to purchase it and read it. The mini-break was going to entail my boyfriend spending hours playing guitars with his brother and then later with his BFF, and his brother's fiance and his BFF's wife were all conveniently elsewhere for the most part, so I had the fantastic opportunity to tag along and not have to do a damn thing. I sat on the couch/futon/floor and read. I read a freaking lot. This was the book I had along to read.It passed the time. It didn't bore me. It held my attention.And... that's about it.It didn't turn my world upside down, or even teeter it necessarily. This is what I like to refer to as a nice popcorn read. I didn't have to give it a lot of thought, the story sort of did the work for me, I was just an innocent and willing bystander. I actually got a little annoyed the few times when it felt like I was beginning to have to work. Like figuring out who the hell Larsson was talking about at any given moment - he was apparently one of those authors who liked to use a character's first name in one sentence and then refer to the same character by their last name in the next sentence. What's up with that? Make a freaking decision and stick with it. Eventually I stopped caring so much.My biggest annoyance with the book (and likely to be the most offense to lovers of this book who stumble across my humble review here) was not the violence and the rape; it actually was Lisbeth Salander. The female protagonist. Okay, so she's cool. I get that. She's Hotty-McHotterson, all corporate and world-weary and a computer hacker to boot. She's pierced and inked, and for some reason this is such a source of fascination for Larsson (and apparently everyone who reads this book). Every time Salander comes into the story there is a mention about her piercings, her surly attitude, her tough clothes, her tattoos. At one point another character counts her tattoos. Six. Six. This apparently contributes to some point Larsson was trying to make that Salander is a social freak, but he's still clearly obsessed with the image of her. For the record, numerous piercings, surly attitudes, tough clothes and six tattoos sums up just about every female I know. It's not all that bizarre. This is, after all, the 21st century. Anyone who lived through the 80s/90s either embodies all of those things or at least doesn't bat an eyelash at those things in others. Maybe it's different in Sweden. Maybe they're just now getting the whole dyed-hair-pierced-faces-crazy-tattoos craze there. Wow. Way to go, Sweden. Maybe if you all hadn't spent the last 30 years listening to ABBA and Europe obsessively, you might actually not find kick-ass girls in boots all that magical.All of these unfair generalizations aside, I can honestly say that I read this book and I'm not all that excited about it. I'm not dying to read the next one, but I'm sure I will eventually (probably if they make a movie of it too). I'm certainly not waiting with bated breath for the third book in the trilogy to come out. I guess I'm just not that fascinated by Salander in particular, so I don't really care what happens to her next. Maybe the movie will make me feel differently. We'll see.ETA (01/14/12): I have since read The Girl Who Played with Fire which I enjoyed more than this first book, though my impression of Lisbeth hadn't changed that much. I have also seen the Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which I liked more than the book because the performances were fantastic, Fincher is a wonderful director, and I felt like the characters could breathe which is something I felt they were unable to do in the book because they were so constricted and pigeon-holed.", "num_likes": 174, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["21st-centurylit", "peer-pressure"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/191414825", "review_id": "191414825", "date": "Jul 28, 2011", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Riku Sayuj", "user_url": "/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj", "text": "Larsson takes what seemed at the outset to be a juicy 'locked-island-mystery plot' and turns it first into an insightful family saga and then into a scathing political and social commentary that forces us to think about such a wide variety of themes and aspects that we normally refuse to accept as part of society. It takes an author like Larsson to shove it in our faces in all its stinking ugliness for us to stop turning the blind eye at these atrocities.Do not mistake this for a mere fictional work with imagined crimes. It has firm foundations in reality. In my opinion, the whole plot is a thin wrap-sheet thrown around the brutal truths of real crimes. Larsson has extensive knowledge of the most heinous crimes and he has written extensively about them for his entire professional career. This expertise shows through in his description of such acts of unimaginable cruelty with an almost nonchalant objectivity, with a careless leaving out of the gory details and focus on the trivial aspects of the act that sends shivers down our spine.Larsson uses his investigative style of presentation and his two main characters and an extremely dysfunctional family to work in an amazing variety of potent themes into his first book. I cannot wait to see what he\u2019ll do in the second one. Some of the themes explored in detail are:Online PrivacyThis is not part of the plot but Larsson seems to be sending out a warning about how deadly information can be in the wrong hands and how easily accessible any private info about you stored in digital form is. You are exposed and absolutely naked to a determined digital assault and there is nothing you can do about it. Of course in the novel it is never misused but the threat is always hanging in the air - if an uneducated girl and her friends can get the most private information about the most protected individuals in the country, what kind of a world are we heading into? And is it really bad? Food for thought...FeminismNo matter which way you look at it, this work will have to defined as one of the most wrathful outcries against society's attitude towards women. The entire story is about the enormous acts of cruelty committed against women and the absolute indifference to it by everyone who is supposed to care. It is also about the different responses that these women have in such an uncaring society. Which brings us to the most important theme of the book in my opinion:Morality and Allocation of BlameThe book is truly about three paths that a victim can take after an abused childhood.One of the characters suffers abuse and decides to become an abuser himself and embrace it as a fact of lifeThe second one suffers abuse and decides to run away from that life and live faraway and sheltered. No attempt is made to punish the abuser or to report it.The third character too suffers abuse but decides to confront it and return it with a vengeance. No violence or abuse is tolerated and any reaction is justified for this character.The fourth is the invisible character of what we expect a person to do in such a situation - report it, seek help from the authorities who are supposed to protect them. The society around and the grim reality that prompted the book gives the outcome to this course of action.Now the key point to me was that Larsson does not condemn any of them - he makes different characters speak in defense for each of these responses and lets us wonder about which course can ever be called right. in the end he manages to condemn both the society as a whole as well as us, the individuals who allow the society to be so. A caricature of morality.Law, Crime & BDSMLarsson's extensive knowledge about the worst forms of crime and the procedure of law allows him to give a gruesome reality to what we usually consider to be just sadistic fiction. He convinces the reader that it is real and all around us if we only cared enough to look.Nazi History, Military Training, Religious Extremism & Apologetics These are also touched upon at various points in the books and provides a background, especially of Swedish Nazism, from which the excuses for all the real crimes in the books could spring from.Journalistic (Professional) EthicsThis too is quite obviously one of the favorite topics for Larsson and it forms a strong undercurrent throughout the book and comes to a head with the firm conviction of the lead character that he is finally a corrupt journalist. He is reassured that he has done the right thing by choosing between being a professional and being a human being. But we as the readers, the character and the author, all know that this is not remotely convincing. Justice was meted out selectively and subjectively in the end and even though it feels right, that is only because of personal knowledge. Is that enough?Financial & Economic Commentary, Industrial Espionage and Hacker-loreLarge parts of the book goes into great detail about industrial politics and machinations and is sometimes quite boring to be frank, but it adds credence to the plot and has to be borne out. The elaborate hacker methodology too is a drag at times but remains mostly interesting and strangely disturbing.The financial interplay and the economic commentary sounds a bit forced but Larsson still manages to give out some forceful ideas such as:\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the largest single drop in the history of the Swedish stock exchange\u2014and you think that\u2019s nonsense?\u201d\u201cYou have to distinguish between two things\u2014the Swedish economy and the Swedish stock market. The Swedish economy is the sum of all the goods and services that are produced in this country every day. There are telephones from Ericsson, cars from Volvo, chickens from Scan, and shipments from Kiruna to Sk\u00f6vde.That\u2019s the Swedish economy, and it\u2019s just as strong or weak today as it was a week ago.\u201d He paused for effect and took a sip of water.\u201cThe Stock Exchange is something very different. There is no economy and no production of goods and services. There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn\u2019t have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that it doesn\u2019t matter if the Stock Exchange drops like a rock?\u201d\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter at all,\u201d Blomkvist said in a voice so weary and resigned that he sounded like some sort of oracle.His words would be quoted many times over the following year.Family & IncestWhat it means to be a family and the inevitable nature of family relationships too seem to haunt Larsson and he gives free reign to his fears and troubles about family life, incest, indifference and corporate life affecting personal relations. He also asks the question of whether we can ever truly judge a person based on corporate success without knowing his relationships with his family and his personal life.There are probably other important ones that I have failed to mention but these were, in my opinion, the things that the book was meant to shine a torchlight on.On The CharactersI found this in an interview with Larsson and it captures the enigma of the two amazing main characters:\u201cI considered Pippi Longstocking,\u201d he said, referring to the most famous creation of the Swedish children\u2019s author Astrid Lindgren, a girl so strong she could carry a horse. \u201cWhat would she be like today? What would she be like as an adult? What would you call a person like that, a sociopath? Hyperactive? Wrong. She simply sees society in a different light. I\u2019ll make her 25 years old and an outcast. She has no friends and is deficient in social skills. That was my original thought.\u201d That thought evolved into Larsson\u2019s formidable heroine, Lisbeth Salander.But he felt Salander needed a counterweight if his story was to be a success. Once again he turned to one of Lindgren\u2019s characters, this time to Kalle Blomkvist, boy detective. \u201cOnly now he\u2019s 45 years old and a journalist [called Mikael Blomkvist]. An altruistic know-it-all who publishes a magazine called Millennium. The story will revolve around the people who work there.\u201d\nPersonal Impressions\nWhile I loved the book wholeheartedly, I still had a few unfavorable impressions:Some of the side characters are a bit sketchy not fully realized. Especially some of the family members including Martin who did not get a gradual transition that a character like him deserved for maximum impact.The stylistically simple nature of the chapters and the book structure too takes away from the sophistication of the detail and plot. A bit more variety in the technique than a simple shift-of-perspective would have been better and less obvious. Also the tension eases off at all the wrong moments, primarily because Larsson has given a portent of things to come later too easily for a whodunnit. The pace too is not consistent and we spend a lot of time seeing scenery and almost every chapter opens with making coffee or with long uneventful walks.In the end, the reader does not get the pleasure of a proper whodunnit as there were no hidden clues spread across the book and in spite of homages throughout the book to masters of crime and mystery fiction, Larsson at some point decided to make his book not fit to the thrill of that genre and moved instead to far more sinister territories.The last section of the book felt much like a filler and had way too much detail and predictable action and could just as well have been left to the reader's imagination. The long winding down has put me off from any tension that would have made me run for the second book immediately. Now that everything is calm and quiet in the Millennium world, I too can take an idyllic break from it all...A good editor and more time to polish would have made this into a definite modern masterpiece, which I strongly suspect it to be already. But in spite of the flaws we still have an opus and some unforgettable characters that will stay with us for a long time to come.\nOne Final Note:\nAll the villains have a Windows PC and all the heroes have an Apple notebook.

Ok, there was a good mystery during the middle third of the book. THere were alot of characters. There was suspense.

Who slogged through those first 200 to find out that the mystery picks up? How did this series get so huge?And there was also a plot that revolved around rape, violence, torture, murder and endless degredation of women. My question is: is this necessary to fictionalize?

Well, not exactly. Lisbeth is awesome and badass, no doubt there, but this book is so much more than just her story, and focusing solely on that undermines the message Stieg Larsson was sending. The original Swedish title is  Men Who Hate Women and it is precisely what the story is about. (*)   * I am pretty sure it received its Book Witness Protection Program name change treatment to avoid being seen as \"that feminist crap\" in the English-speaking society. Where \"feminist\" sadly may still be viewed as an insult. Apparently a teenage Larsson witnessed and failed to stop rape of a young woman. He was so affected by it that he wrote his magnum opus to make amends for the witnessed atrocity. Thus we have Men Who Hate Women, which is a short description of the focus of his entire Millenium series. Larsson speaks up - angrily, loudly, with conviction - on behalf of not just Salander but all women who have been marginalized, dismissed, paternalised, silenced, treated as inferior, treated as property, overlooked, infantilized, sexualized, assaulted, and murdered.Larsson, like his protagonist Blomkvist, was an investigative journalist who specialized in airing out stuff that many \"higher-ups\" would want to see left alone. (**)  ** To quote Terry Pratchett (all bow to his genius), \"It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.\" This book is an angry and poignant social commentary on the right-wing extremism, prejudice, Nazi leanings, and of course misogyny that still permeate even the quintessential European paradise country of Sweden. Larsson condemns all this, and in his journalism-like style does not hold back the slightest bit. And it is often an uncomfortable read as we see and recognize all those little societal bits and conventions that make these prejudices and even violence possible.Larsson may not be the most skillful writer, his prose may suffer from long-windedness and overabundance of details (seriously, at times it reads like a cross between a diary and a shopping catalog), but he has strong opinions on painful subjects and is not afraid to let them be known. He had this attitude both in his journalism and his fiction, and I applaud him for that.  3 stars only because of weak prose, but full marks for content.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Also posted on my blog.", "num_likes": 150, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["i-also-saw-the-film", "2011-reads", "awesome-kickass-heroines"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/38206165", "review_id": "38206165", "date": "Nov 20, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Manny", "user_url": "/user/show/1713956-manny", "text": "One of the best thrillers I've ever read. Great story, great characters, very intelligent and thoughtful. Writing is nothing special but it doesn't need to be.___________________________________________I finally saw the movie a couple of days ago, and I'm a bit conflicted. On the plus side, it conveys the feel of the book very well, and several of the main characters are excellently realized. I particularly liked Lisbeth, who was just perfect. But they have taken some enormous liberties with the story. For example, Erika, who in the book is a central figure, has almost disappeared. So if you're a purist, you might want to avoid this, but in the end I decided I liked it. I guess it's just a bit too long, and cuts were necessary.___________________________________________I just read the following passage in Precious Williams's review of this book, but I have seen at least half a dozen similar ones:The constant references to sandwiches (you get the impression the Swedes eat at least an entire loaf of bread every day), coffee (how on earth do they manage to sleep?) and breasts became tedious very rapidly.I can stay silent no longer. Precious and others, I lived in Sweden for most of the 80s, and I can tell that you Stieg Larsson wasn't making it up:1. Sandwiches. Yes, you're right: Swedes love sandwiches. There's a widespread belief that eating bread is good for you. When I was there, I caught the tailend of a popular campaign by the Ministry of Health, whose tagline was \u00c4t 6-8 skivor br\u00f6d om dagen - eat 6-8 slices of bread a day. Moreover, Swedish bread is delicious. I'm thinking about kruskalimpa and r\u00e5grut right now and my mouth is watering. If they were on sale here, I'd definitely eat more sandwiches.2. Coffee. Swedes used to drink more coffee per capita than any other county in the world, though I understand that they've now slipped a couple of places. It's powerful stuff too, but you get used to it. Fun facts: Swedish has a verb fika, meaning \"to drink coffee\" and a noun, p\u00e5t\u00e5r, meaning \"a second cup of coffee\". You know, the old Eskimo/snow thing.3. Breasts. Topless sunbathing is popular in Sweden, and Swedes are in general extremely relaxed about nudity. Swedish men have pretty much the same interests as men everywhere else in the world.

The first 1/3 of the book showed promise. Two seperate characters who will soon cross paths. Kind of classic mystery story telling. But then it has some moments of perversity that didn't really need to be in the story. Kind of creepy and weird. I guess there is not a lot to do in Sweden.  The second part they are together on an island trying to solve a mystery that was never really engaging. They had to find out what happened to a girl forty years ago. Wow! Exciting stuff. Oh and some family members were part of the Nazi party sixty years ago. Uh ok. Not sure why that is relevant but every good mystery needs a Nazi or two I'm sure. The story brings out more sexual darkness (I can see the tourist ads now for Sweden) and disolves into a weird sexual torture/homosexual/incest tale. No Beastiality? C'mon! I feel cheated! The last 1/3 of the book was never really needed because the mystery is over and it basically takes the author 100 pages to wrap it up. Oh and we find out his longtime lover is into B&D and S&M. Why this is important? I have no idea. But it was important to Stieg. I like to call him Stieg because, even though he is dead, I feel that we are on a first name basis after the author uses \"buttplug\" in his book. It was not that great of a book. I am shocked at all the great reviews. A girlfriend of mine agreed with all the problems I had with the book yet she still loved it. This seems to be the case with many book groups. Why? I don't understand admitting the book is crap but still loving it. The end results were not remotely believable. A woman comes off a sheep ranch where she has been living for the last forty years and immediately takes over a fortune 500 type company. Uh, ok?

I did find it strange that the author seemed to have a Mac fetish among many others. Also, his main character is the self appointed moral watchdog of companies (because capitalism is evil I guess) yet can't keep his zipper zipped.

You heard all the hype about the author who died and his books weren't published. You heard that they were translated into English. You heard they were great and both Sweden and Hollywood were making a movie of it. Well, it's all true. So is the fact that this is a must read for every mystery fan!\nStory\nSo many plots, so little time. Basically, the primary plot is about a missing girl. A relative wants to find out what happened that mysterious day decades ago. Enter a flawed newspaper report. Enter a troubled hacker. Enter a few romances. Mischief. Confusion. Alliances. Enemies. And none of that includes the rather extensive family of the missing girl -- some who believe she died, some who couldn't even care more. The story weaves in and out telling the various plights of the hacker, the newspaper man and the family with secrets. It comes together in an explosive way -- every plot twist imaginable all combined into one. The description of the death scenes are so vivid that feel like you are there! By the end, I wanted to meet these people... and so will you.\nStrengths\n1. The characters are just a force not to be reckoned with. You will have strong feelings towards ALL of them.2. The plot and the way in which Larsson weaves the sub-plots together. It's genius and it's captivating.\nWeaknesses\n1. Really none... it's not for the easy reader or one who wants a straightforward, simple story. You have to want the complexity.\nFinal Thoughts\nGet it now. Don't watch the movie. Maybe learn Swedish so you can read the story in it's written language. But to be honest, the translation hardly misses a beat.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

So here's a list of complaints:a.) Either this was very poorly translated or very poorly written. I've heard arguments for both. Tons of unnecessary details (all the coffee stops!), repetition of things we already know, paragraphs about nothing just petering out. Even at times when I was enjoying the plot, I felt as though I had to fight my way through dull writing.b.) For as dull as it is in most parts, this book is waaaay too over the top in others. Butt plugs?! What is my reaction to that even supposed to be? (For the curious: it was a big old WTF face.) While I think there is a place for graphic rape and torture scenes (more in film than in books, because it's not as hard to convey intent in a multi-dimensional visual format), I didn't see the need for them here. Salander being the survivor of rape and perpetrator of revenge did not make me root for her here -- as it might have in a film -- because it was only a tangential and forgotten part of the story, rather than being necessary to it. We don't see her dealing with the aftereffects of her abuse at all; she's not fundamentally changed because of it, aside from taking her revenge. Which leads me to:c.) Salander's supposed to be this amazingly kickass character that I'll just automatically love, right? Umm, no. Aside from knowing that she's a good investigator, sexual but detached, has Asperger's and is kind of ruthless, I felt like she could have been anyone. Really. I looked for some piece of insight or indication that she is a dynamic character that would make me like her, but it never happened. Dressing her up like a punk in a sea of suits is not enough characterization. Perhaps in further books and with time, I'd feel attached to her like I've felt to other mystery series characters, but I'm not really tempted to read on. d.) The only reason I was invested in the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance is because I thought she'd been murdered. When it turned out she was still alive and had skipped town, I wanted to throw the damn book at a wall. e.) How freaking over the top was it for the murderer to have a Hostel-style torture chamber right in his house? Does anyone find this seriously scary, instead of laughably stupid? Moreover, does this sort of thing exist outside the world of comic book super villains? Better make sure THAT room's locked when company comes over.I enjoyed this book so little that after the solution to the Harriet mystery wrapped up, I just skimmed to the end. I have no idea what happened with the Wennerstrom affair, nor do I particularly care.

Not even a body is found, and her great uncle, Henrik Vanger, has explored every possible lead to discover what happened to his one and only favourite family member.Over the last forty years her disappearance has become Henrik's obsession, and he's positive someone in the family murdered her - but they never found a motive, and without one he doesn't know who to suspect. Now, in 2005, Henrik has little time left as he grows old and plenty of money to indulge in his obsession one last time.Mikael Blomkvist is a forty-something financial journalist and editor of Millennium magazine, a magazine he co-founded which prides itself on investigative journalism. But Blomkvist and the magazine have just suffered their first big blow: he's been convicted of libel against one of the biggest business entrepreneurs in Sweden, Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m.Wanting to keep a low profile and pretend he's been fired from the magazine in order to try and save it from further attack by Wennerstr\u00f6m, Henrik Vanger's proposition comes at an ideal time. Mikael's father once worked for the Vanger Corporation, and Harriet herself had babysat little Mikael a few times. Henrik offers Blomkvist a year-long contract with the pretext of writing a history of the family - an autobiography of Henrik - while his real mission is to discover what happened to Harriet.After some convincing, Blomkvist takes the job - but when he discovers the first new evidence since the tragedy occurred, he realises he needs help - and who better to go to than the private investigator who did such a good job on Blomkvist when Henrik hired her? Lisbeth Salander is a quiet, secretive young woman who excels at what she does because she's also a genius hacker. With a troubled past and a dicey present, her trust in Blomkvist takes her by surprise. The two team up to discover the truth about Harriet, and to take Wennerstr\u00f6m down.Thanks to a friend of mine, who also recommended this to me, I knew the English translation of the original title before I started reading this, which is Men Who Hate Women. This is actually very interesting and worth mentioning. It's certainly an apt title; perhaps not obvious at first, after a while it becomes a very clear theme. It may also give it away a bit. But I can also understand why they went with a very different title for the English translation. Lisbeth is \"the girl with the dragon tattoo\" - among other tattoos and piercings - and she is one of two main characters. The second book's English title is \"The girl who played with fire\", so you can see they're going with their own theme here.More importantly, though, such a title is more appealing to an English-language audience. Titles, like covers, that feature girls or women - or wives - are popular and sell well. This is an intriguing title, and doesn't give away the genre. When this book first came out, the hardcover was marketed to a literary crowd. This is the mass market paperback edition, and with a quote from Harlan Coben on the cover along with the style of cover itself (and the long, narrow format), it is more clearly pitched at the Mystery mob (hence why both my parents-in-law read this before I did).It is a mystery, and a thriller at times, and a detective book - but it's also a political and economic commentary, has one of the more original and daring heroines of the genre, and is invigorating in its details. I don't read many mystery novels, because (ironically), I find them boring. Aside from a quiet patch at about the two-quarter mark, I never found this book boring, even though not a whole lot happens until the last third.Both Blomkvist and Salander are engaging protagonists, for very different reasons. Things happen to them that will make you upset and angry, especially Salander, whose side story holds you enthralled and revolted at the same time, as does the truth about Harriet - but there's nothing gratuitous here, or unnecessarily included or described: it's all relevant.The pacing is superb (yes, even with that \"quiet patch\"), and the plotting cleverly controlled. The cold of Sweden - at times down to -35F (which makes the 44F of Shiver seem somewhat laughable) - was vividly realised, as was the setting of Hedeby Island. I would have liked to \"see\" more of Sweden - everything was terribly familiar - but a mystery book isn't really the place for that.This is a very mature book, with themes that make you despair yet are handled so compassionately that you are never alienated. I also enjoyed the economic side of the other plot line, and Blomkvist's words towards the end were very apt considering the recent problems with the American stock exchange and subsequent recession, when he's asked by a TV host about \"the fact that Sweden's economy was now headed for a crash.\" He calls it nonsense, and goes on to explain something which I think we all tend to forget:\"You have to distinguish between two things - the Swedish economy and the Swedish stock market. The Swedish economy is the sum of all the goods and services that are produced in this country every day. There are telephones from Ericsson, cars from Volvo, chickens from Scan, and shipments from Kiruna to Sk\u00f6vde. That's the Swedish economy, and it's just as strong or weak today as it was a week ago. ... The Stock Exchange is something very different. There is no economy and no production of goods and services. There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn't have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy.\" (p819)Sure that's a simplistic way of putting it, but his description of the Stock Exchange pretty neatly sums up the way I've always perceived it - and scorned it. So I enjoyed this exchange, and the whole Wennerstr\u00f6m sub plot, as much as the mystery about Harriet itself.The other side of the commentary that's strong and interesting is the issue of journalistic responsibility, and ethics. Decisions are made at the end that are highly questionable, but there are no easy answers - Blomkvist is the voice of our conscience here, and yet you can see the other side too. I don't envy him his position!I have no complaints with this book, but I have one to the publisher: I really hate the new, narrow format of mass market paperbacks. (Thankfully, only a few books get printed like this.) They're just so tall and ... skinny. It certainly doesn't save any paper, and makes me feel like I'm falling off the edge of the page at the end of each line, which barely fits five words. I don't care for the larger typeface and roomy layout either - I like tighter lines and smaller fonts, personally.

I have watched the movie ages ago but luckily, I confuse it with another so I remembered nothing useful about the plot. After my friend insisted I read it and lent me his copy, I finally gave it a shot. And I'm glad I did. It turned out to be much better than I expected and I certainly get its fame now.I won't be reviewing this book. With 70k+ reviews, mine is hardly needed. But I still like to mention a few things.First, I loved the message. Larsson doesn't shy away from making his point. This book was written in 2005 while sexual harassment and gender-based violence were starting to get more spotlight in literature and around the world, you rarely came across books with such a clear message. I really think the title should've stayed \"Men Who Hate Women\". Sure, this one will grab more readers but the Swedish title describes this book much better.Another thing I enjoyed was the mystery. Once Blomkvist and Salander started working together, the book got really gripping. The side story about Millenium was also interesting but my favorite part was uncovering the mystery. I admired Lisbeth as a character but I hope we'll be told later how she started hacking, especially since she's very skilled at it. The book wasn't without its flaws, however. My complaints can be summed up into two points:1- The story took too long to start. The random (or what felt like random at the time) perspectives at the start didn't help. I was very lost at first and I still think we had too much information to process at the beginning since the three plots were very detached. Yet I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't for point 2.2- The details. We had an insane level of details. It was way too much. It felt like Larsson narrated every single thing the characters did. And I'm talking about those tiny details. Like holding a cup or flipping a page or I don't have the book now to find quotes but those minuscule details no one cares about nor are they important to the story. And there was also graphic description of some messed up stuff (and didn\u2019t really serve the plot). I honestly started glossing over them because they were abundant. If Larsson had been more to the point, it would've been better. It also took our main characters 300 pages to meet which was way too long since the plot only really started them. I also couldn't put the book down once this happened. I'm glad I finally read the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it's a fine mystery. I had a few criticisms but overall very much enjoyed the story and found the characters well-written.

I don't know, because I couldn't bear to finish this. It usually takes me about a day to read a book. It took me an entire month to slog through less than 300 pages of Larsson's bullshit.

I TEACH ESL FROM BRITISH TEXTBOOKS, AND I STILL HAD TO TEXT MY BRITISH FRIEND AND ASK FOR DEFINITIONS. One word: Haberdashery? FABRIC STORE!!! Yeah. 3) The family tree in the first few pages helps, but the character names and places are so close that they're endlessly confusing if you're not Swedish: Henrik, Harold (who live in Hedeby near Hedestad, by the way), Harriet, Berger the lover and Birger the crazy relative, Gustav, Gregor, Gerda, Gottfried ....

The premise of the story is not so simple:Meet Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist of financial sectors, but today his accusations against industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom are proved to be false hence he is fined and sentenced three months in prison for libelling.Trying to get away from his publication house for some time, he lands up at Hedeby island, with Henrik Vanger, retired CEO of Vanger corporation. Henrik asks him to solve the mystery behind murder of her niece, Harriet Vanger. Murder was committed some 36 years ago on same island where entire Vanger family was present on some occasion and island was temporarily cut off from the world due to accident on bridge, the only connecting link. So the island is isolated and there is chaos on island due to accident, and in midst of this Harriet disappears, body never found, considered dead. So what unfolds is a locked-room murder mystery.Did I miss something? Yes, Lisbeth Salander.Cold, calculated and the girl with the dragon tattoo. She works as personal investigator at a security firm, her story moves parallel to the Blomkvist\u2019s story until she is hired as detective alongside Blomkvist.Positive aspects of the story:Let me confess that this is one of the best murder mystery novel I have ever read (though I am not a fan of this genre). At no point I could guess who is the murderer, because there is no hint but when it is disclosed, it perfectly fits with the story. What makes this story even more interesting is that murder was committed 36 years ago, some people present on that day are already dead and some are too old.The characters are excellently portrayed and plus point of the story. Larsson uses subplot to develop characters over pages and pages before jumping into action. Therefore I connected with their thoughts and decisions, except Lisbeth. She has been shown differently and this makes her an interesting character, she downplays emotion and makes unpredictable moves.What went wrong with such a good story that I rated it only 3 stars.I have heard people say that bad translation can ruin a good story. Well, this sets a perfect example in that case. I\u2019m sure, if Steig Larsson could write such a good story then his prose in English would have been readable and interesting enough. What I\u2019m trying to say is, Reg Keeland (the translator) f**ked up this amazing 5 star novel to a 3 star read. I know that I love sleeping but falling asleep at the climax of the story means seriously bad writing.Another thing that this book needs other than good translator is a good editor. There is so much unnecessary excessive detailing of electronic gadgets, let me give you example, Lisbeth\u2019s laptop get run over by a vehicle and now she needs to buy a new one, so here the author goes on to give entire configuration of the laptop that was damaged and again the entire configuration of the laptop she is eyeing to buy. One more, one more, Blomkvist relocates to new house and is taking electronic items out of his bag, here each time he takes out a item, the author write about it with its BRAND NAME, Sony laptop, Sanyo sound recorder, this scanner, that portable printer.And yes, how can I forget all those coffee and sandwich(es). Throughout the entire story, the only things that the characters drank and ate were coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich.Last thing that I didn\u2019t liked was the wrap-up of subplot after the central story has already ended. After the story ended, the author goes on further 50 pages or so to put an end to Wennerstrom affair, which is highly unreadable.One thing more is that this was published as trilogy, so even when the main characters life is on line and the situation is supposed to be highly tensed, it isn\u2019t because I know that the main characters will survive because there are two books remaining ahead.

About 3-4 years ago I tried to start this but the beginning just bored me intensely so I quit but damn I wish I didn't.This ended up being SO good. I haven't been this invested or sold on a book in so long! I read 841 pages in 5 days and that's with me watching 2 seasons of Grey's Anatomy in the same time period. I absolutely flew through this book and have already begun reading the second book because I just need more.The plot is actually why I picked this book up when I did. Long story short, I was in the mood for mystery books and I was in a short supply so I had to choose this one! I loved the mystery, the intricacy, the intensity and the chaos and honestly I just loved the entire plot. It was everything I needed, I loved the setting, the writing was so so riveting, I just adored this book from page 1 to page 841.Characters though. Blomkvist is someone I really grew to just love. I loved his attitude and his intensity and his desire to do good and his emotions. Larsson wrote him so well and fleshed him out perfectly. I love his lifestyle and his personality and I feel like I know him so well now even though I don't remember this happening.And Salander, I love her deeply. I will admit she did things I didn't fully agree with, nor understand. But they were so in character for her that I didn't really care in the end. She's such a strong independent character but is also so incredibly childish and broken sometimes that it hurts your heart. The end of the book, literally the last 2 pages, broke my heart for her just a little bit because we saw one instance of emotion from her and it turned out so poorly.So yeah I mean I loved this? Like deeply. Something like 75% of the people I'm friends with on here gave this a 3 star or less and I just can't understand where they saw flaws when I did not. I will say there were like 3 things that did bother me but they did not hugely impact my overall feelings about the book. For the 4 people on Goodreads who haven't read this book, I really advise you to because it was just so engrossing!Now to go watch the American movie and read the rest of the trilogy. After those I will determine my mood about the 4th novel and I will watch all the Swedish movies.

Nobody misses them\"\nThe characters are brilliantly shaped and especially that of Froken Salander. She is the most badass girl I have ever read and the best part is how her character curve builds up all through the book and right until the very last sentence. The author keeps her true to her initial image even as he builds her up. \"She wanted to hear him say that he liked her for who she was. That she was someone special in his world and in his life. She wanted him to give her some gesture of love, not just of friendship and companionship.\"\"What a pathetic fool you are, Salander\" she said out loud to herself.As the book proceeds, there are shocking discoveries made and it becomes apparent that Kalle Blomkvist is clearly out of his depth.\u201cYou are a very ordinary little person, Mikael.

It did manage to pull a small twist on me but after that again I knew what was coming. The suspense actually did not work for me. But other than that I loved how this book was written. A lot of things were dumbed down and explain for better understanding of the readers. Since it is a translation I cannot really say but I would venture that the prose was good too since the translation came of brilliantly.The book never managed to lose steam and is very well paced. It never drags and it does a great job telling a story that is so close to the reality. Also it brings all the issues to a close and does not leave the reader hanging. I completely loved this book and could not put it down despite trying several times and will soon be picking up the second installment bcz I would love to read more of Salander, who is  \u201can information junkie with a delinquent child\u2019s take on morals and ethics.\u201dHowever, despite everything the book throws at you and the ugly picture that it paints, I felt a certain thing in my heart and I was mighty glad when the beloved Lis put it in memorable words.

It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.\"That quote explains perfectly how I feel about this book. An unpolished translation of an unedited book that the world collectively lost their shit over. It goes without saying, if you want insta-success, you need to die (or fake your death, but more on that later) and leave behind a)secret paintings b) proof of sexual escapades with some celebrity c) a buncha manuscripts no one knew you were working on. The author died on November 1st 2004 and the first publication of this book was on January 1st, 2005. They really shoved this novel out, don'tcha think? Shortly after Stieg Larsson passed away, three completed novels were found. Those novels were then published. I don't know about the rest of the series, but this joker is most definitely a first draft. Superfluous detail like character histories that take up whole pages only for that character to never be heard from again, meandering chapters that bring up stuff never again touched upon, page after page of coffee (thanks a heap to Tobin for pointing that shit out because after he mentioned it, I realized there's nary a chapter without someone starting, drinking, or tossing out a pot of coffee). Larsson bit the big one after climbing seven flights of stairs because the elevator in his office building was broken. That's sad, because I would have liked to have read a streamlined version of this book. Which brings me to my next point...The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is actually two books. You have one book that's really quite interesting. This first book gives us the reason everyone lost their shit over it: Lisbeth Salander. Strong women like her are hard to find, and when you do find them, they are without hangups. Salander is fucked up, but keeps on doing her thing. Every scene with her in it is great. Unfortunately, she's strapped to the helm of a truly by-the-numbers cold-case thriller. I like that there's no damsel-in-distress moment in this book, but other than that, this plot and payoff have been done ad nauseam. Which brings me to book two...A financial thriller with a heavy dose of journalistic integrity morals. I don't give a fuck about that part of the story, so I choose not to comment on it, other than to say, Wennerstr\u00f6m was never a threat. All that shit happened on the back burner, and it felt like the novel slogged trying to tie up a fuck load of loose strings that I couldn't be bothered to care about. This is, by far, the worst translation I've ever read. There are several places where the translator gave not a single fuck and just threw in what he thought the author might have meant. This is another problem with publishing posthumously. I almost want to read the original Swedish text to see what the author actually wrote. And because it's bound to come up if I don't cite my reasoning behind why I think the translator just gave up at certain parts, I provide the jury with two examples:Example #1:\"an apology of a desk\"Perhaps the author meant: \"a sorry excuse for a desk\"Example #2:\"a common and garden bastard\"Perhaps the author meant:\"a garden variety bastard\"Oh, and I see why Daniel Craig was cast as Blomkvist for the 'Murican version of this book's adaptation. Like Craig's other popular character, James Bond, Blomkvist gets more strange than Wilt Chamberlain. Dude fucks all three of the main females in this book. The only reason he didn't fuck Harriet Vanger was because... oops, sorry can't tell you because spoilers!Anyfart, the only way I'll be reading the rest of these doorstops is if someone can assure me we find out more about Salander's past. I'd be willing to slog through another 2,000 pages just to find out more about her. She's the only reason I gave this tired, bloated, posthumously-published-and-unpolished novel three stars instead of two. Because I like her. The rest of the book? Meh.One final bit that's sure to pis some people off:I'm a conspiracy theorist at heart, and I kinda think Larsson faked his death. He was receiving death threats before he died of a heart attack and had been in hiding. What better way to disappear than to have the proceeds from a book to start a new life with. I'm sure Larsson, Tupac, and Elvis are all riding around the Swiss Alps on golden snow mobiles, drinking Orphan Tear vodka, and fucking busty Yetis. In summation: Fuck 50% of this book. Fuck Blomkvist. Fuck Berger. Fuck Armansky, Henrik, and Frode. Especially fuck Cecilia, who was there because... I don't know why. To be fucked by Blomkvist, I guess. Fuck 'em all, aside from Salander. She's cool, and makes this book worth a read if you need to win a bet or someone's kidnapped your poodle and the ransom is you must read this thing by that one dead guy. Final Judgment: A common and garden bastard.If any of you think I've been insensitive in my review and feel you want to ask how I would feel if someone ragged on my work after I died, I'd tell you that I wouldn't give a shit.

I\u2019m usually wary when the hype around a book reaches huge proportions and this novel has been a worldwide phenomenon even before I started seeing it all over the bookstores here in America. But this is one example of when the furor is justified.There are two main characters. Mikael Blomkvist, a veteran financial reporter, and Lisbeth Salander, an anti-social punk with a part-time job as a researcher at a security firm.When the book begins, Blomkvist has just lost a libel case where he had written about criminal wrong doing by a prominent industrialist, Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. With his reputation in ruins and the magazine he co-owns on the brink of collapse, Blomkvist is summoned to Hedeby Island by Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of a wealthy family. Henrik wants to commission Blomkvist to write a family history, but that\u2019s just a cover story. Henrik\u2019s niece, Harriet, vanished while on Hedeby Island in the early 1960s during a day when the island was cut off from the mainland due to a massive traffic accident on its only bridge. It's the ultimate locked room (or locked island) mystery. Over 30 years of investigation have convinced Henrik that Harriet was murdered, very possibly by someone in the Vanger family, and he wants Blomkvist to comb through the massive amount of material he\u2019s collected and see if he can find anything new about the case.Blomkvist is hesitant, but Henrik not only offers to help cover his financial problems due to the libel case and with the failing magazine, he also claims to have evidence that would prove that Wennerstr\u00f6m is a criminal and will help clear Blomkvist\u2019s reputation. Blomkvist agrees and moves to Hedeby Island to begin the research.As this is going on, a parallel story revolving around Lisbeth Salander is also being told. Salander is so anti-social that she can barely function in society and has to endure legal guardianship by the state since it decided that she\u2019s incapable of managing her own life. However, Salander is really a brilliant researcher and computer genius who just can't stand people. Originally hired by Henrik Vanger to vet Blomkvist, Salander becomes intrigued with Blomkvist\u2019s libel case and begins checking out Wennerstr\u00f6m on her own. However, changes in her legal status concerning her guardianship soon present her with severe problems in her own life.There were several things I loved about this book, and one of them is the leisurely pace it has for the first half. Most of this portion consists of Blomkvist sitting in a cabin on Hedeby Island reading about Harriet while Salander is in a desperate struggle to reassert some independence against her new guardian. The key part of the mystery about Harriet really doesn\u2019t pick up until the second half of the novel, but it didn\u2019t bother me a bit. I was so caught up in the story that I was perfectly happy to let it unfold as slowly as it wanted.I also loved the characters. Blomkvist is a great reporter and a very decent man, but he can also be selfish and a bit of a shit. The book doesn\u2019t pull any punches in indicating that he isn\u2019t a good father and is a bit too casual in his relationships with women. Salander is unfriendly and lacks any social graces at all so she should be unpleasant to read about. But even before the book engages your sympathy for her due to an extremely bad situation she finds herself in, I couldn\u2019t help but like the damaged girl who has such an anti-authority streak that she refuses to ask for help from the police or lawyers when she has every right and reason to. She\u2019d rather handle her problems herself than engage an authority figure, and she\u2019s got a mean streak.Another thing I liked is that even though this was written before the worldwide 2008 financial implosion, the author Stieg Larsson, who was a financial reporter in Sweden, uses the subplot about Wennerstr\u00f6m to illustrate how he felt that financial reporters were entirely too close to the financial bigwigs and no real investigative reporting was being done. Recent revelations about guys like Bernie Madoff makes it clear that Larsson was ringing an alarm bell. Too bad no one listened.Fair warning for those considering reading. The original Swedish title of this book is Men Who Hate Women, and you\u2019ll see why if you read it. Although not overly explicit, there are several segments dealing with rape and sexual assault.Larsson apparently wrote mysteries as a hobby and had completed three but hadn\u2019t tried to publish them until shortly before his death a few years ago.

It\u2019s a cold case but Henrik has faith that Mikael will uncover something meaningful. Lisbeth Salander, our tattooed heroine, is a computer hacker supreme with the mindset of a vigilante and when she isn\u2019t being completely bad ass she works as a private investigator. One of her assignments is Mikael Blomkvist, who she inevitably teams up with.As a whodunnit mystery it\u2019s fantastic. The pacing of the investigation is brilliant, with just enough snippets of information gradually uncovered to keep you hooked and guessing until the end. Even though she is the title character Lisbeth isn\u2019t overly used and appears less than Mikael. This keeps her character fresh and when she does show up you pay attention.

Someone should do a study some day about why we are pulled to certain books at certain times - the way our body pulls us toward a banana when it's running low on potassium. One of the things I loved about Larsson when I first read him (and why I return to him) is this kind of artlessness that he has about writing. There's a naturalness to the way he tells the story as if the important thing is giving you the facts as expediently as possible. Of course, the facts of the story also include what he thinks is interesting about the characters thoughts, feelings, personal history. You get drawn in by this sense that author is being guided in his narration by an instinct, a scent for what is interesting to him (which he assumes will probably be interesting to you as well) and also by what you sense as his delight in discovering the very thing he's writing about as he is writing it. After he died, his life-long partner wrote that Larsson wrote his trilogy as a hobby. He was bored and wanted something fun to do. Can you imagine? I think that's why I am so attracted to his books and why I go back to them as a source of inspiration for my own writing. How beautiful to write with the passion and interest that a hobby draws from us. Yes, literature and art give meaning to our lives and there are serious messages in Larsson's books and tons of darkness. But I think his inventiveness with plot, his ability to mix reality with fiction, his creation of characters we will never forget starts with the playfulness and joy of a man finally finding a little bit of time to be alone with his hobby.

Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch\u2014and there's always a catch\u2014is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.My Review: I did not like this book. Many of the things that are so praised about it, for example Lisbeth's survival and empowerment are rancid. Here:Much stronger boys in her class soon learned that it could be quite unpleasant to fight with that skinny girl. Unlike other girls in the class, she never backed down, and she would not for a second hesitate to use her fists or any weapon at hand to protect herself. She went around with the attitude that she would rather be beaten to death than take any shit.Okay, so there's my first issue...a little girl gets picked on and has to hold her own. I don't think that's fun reading because I wasn't protected from bullies as a blind (my astigmatism is very bad) fat kid. Later I turned into the bullier. It's unpleasant to read about.Then there's the book's attitude towards life in general:I\u2019ve had many enemies over the years. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s never engage in a fight you\u2019re sure to lose. On the other hand, never let anyone who has insulted you get away with it. Bide your time and strike back when you\u2019re in a position of strength\u2014even if you no longer need to strike back.An eye for an eye leaves the whole goddamned world blind, to paraphrase several sources.Lisbeth's horrific experiences and her scars of all sorts aren't the only unpleasant realities of her life:Her voice was as rough as sandpaper. As long as Blomkvist lived, he would never forget her face as she went on the attack. Her teeth were bared like a beast of prey. Her eyes were glittering, black as coal. She moved with the lightning speed of a tarantula and seemed totally focus on her prey as she swung the club again, striking Martin in the ribs.Her behavior is understandable. Her motives are crystal-clear. I think it's repugnant. I think the author's tone isn't in the least indicative of a woman's seizing the power the world did its goddamnedest to rip away from her.

In essence, he took a couple of pre-existing Swedish fictional characters, Kalle Blomkvist and Pippi Longstocking (both by the author Astrid Lindgren), and brutally modernized them. He made Lisbeth Salander, his heroine, a gritty, super-intelligent, firecracker of a lead. She dominated the series even though the story started with Mikhael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter caught in a series of intrigues. Rather than Mikhael remain the book's main star, he becomes Lisbeth's partner and then eventually her sidekick. While he is sensuous, calm, and by-the-book, she has a knife-edge fragility and outsized personal strength honed by years of trauma, rejection, loss, and victimization. Lisbeth absorbed the worst of misogyny before turning the tables to become what misogynists fear most: a strong, brilliant, independent, fierce woman.My copy of his debut is dog-eared and torn from rereading. I devoured it to understand better how to make a character come alive. I am sure I will reread it again this year. His two sequels don't seem as polished, but he had died before he could re-edit them (as most writers would so early in the process). It's a shame. If you haven't yet, check this book out.

Makes me wonder if Larsson had a premonition about his manuscript. As I mentioned in an update, I have to agree with what most people have said about this book: it drags in the beginning and takes forever to set things up and get moving, but once it does it's a pretty good ride. Also: I HIGHLY recommend the audio, read by Simon Vance. If not for him, I doubt I would have read this for another ten years. One thing I really feel the need to point out is how absolutely misleading the English title for this book is. Personally, I don't see Lisbeth as the main focus of this novel-- sure, she and Mikael are the co-protagonists, but the book doesn't revolve solely around her. The Swedish title is literally \"Men Who Hate Women\", which makes MUCH more sense and is something readers ought to keep in in the back of their mind as they read this. Lisbeth and Mikael are themselves both great, flawed characters, but the original title is essentially handing you the theme of the whole book rather than focusing on one individual character.Although, what an individual she is. Lisbeth may be the smartest literary heroine I've read, and she's absolutely fascinating. I know next to nothing about hacking (or journalism or finance, for that matter), but she gave me such an adrenaline rush because of the high she got out of doing her job to the best of her ability. Otherwise, I feel like I can relate to her on some levels. She broke my heart with her optimism by the end of the novel, and I was coolly in tune with her standoffish attitude in the earlier pages. I've got both follow-up books on the shelf upstairs, but I think I'll look into the audio first; Larsson has (had?) a very dry style, and if the others take awhile to set things up like this one did, I'll be glad for the audio. I do feel like things could have been sped up a bit in the beginning, edited better and whatnot, and Mikael seemed a bit inconsistent earlier in the book. The second half of the book is so strong, though, that it pushed a lot of my qualms aside in favor of hearing the rest of the story unravel.And as far as the murder-mystery stitched into the middle, no, technically I did NOT guess the culprit on the first shot (big surprise, I'm terrible at that).

One is a devious (and rather nasty) story of a missing/murdered girl; an unsolved cold-case. The other plot is about Industrial corruption.

Now that I know what to expect I skipped the (view spoiler)[ rape scene, which is too vivid and graphic and disgusting and just ew! but somehow necessary  (hide spoiler)] My friends asked me why would I re-read if I was disgusted by that scene. The answer is simple: Women, rarely get revenge IRL. I loved how the bad guys in this book got what was coming for them. When Lisbeth gets her revenge I feel like I'm vicariously getting mine. I love it.Lisbeth is a force of nature, a complex character like no other, one of my favorite heroines ever. I love how she had her own moral code and stick to it. She's extremely smart and could use her hacking talent to do very bad things, but she doesn't. She just wants to be left alone. Not everyone accepts Lisbeth the way she is, she looks weak and weird and people will try to bully her and abuse her, but she doesn't care. She has tricks under her sleeve.The rest of the characters are all bizarre, but somehow believable and interesting. Blomksvit and Erika Berger, a married woman, have a relationship ... and the husband knows! It's just an open marriage, but nobody gets hurt.  I'll say The girl with the dragon tattoo is an ode to diversity. I love it and the movie was amazing! Rooney Mara was robbed her Oscar. I heard because Meryl streep won instead, but watch that movie and you'll see how Rooney was robbed big time.As a mystery I wouldn't say it's the best. I guessed early how Harriet's \"body\" has vanished, and narrowed down the suspects to two. What I couldn't guess was the kind of tricky story that was behind the family drama. At the end the mystery aspect doesn't matter. It's the human nature and the dark sides of humanity that TGWTDT a great read.If you're looking for an adult dark read with no romance I recommend this book, just some tips:* Avoid the audio version. Too many Swedish names to keep up* Skim to the explanation of why Blomksvit landed in jail. That's boring! Resume normal reading when Armansky appears because he'll introduce the heroine. * Keep the family tree at hand so you don't get confused. * Get ready to feel disgusted. Everything is in graphic, gory detail.* Expect a lot of feminist messages.* Be Patient, this book is a slow read Mind you that this isn't a fluffy read, it's very dark and there's not even a little bit of romance to keep us going.

JUNIE B. JONES GOES TO FIELD DAY EVERYONE. SHE GOES. THE END. BUT BEFORE SHE GOES WE'RE GOING TO DESCRIBE HER LUNCH EVERYDAY IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL, THEN NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN.Seriously, I don't know why I read about the tech specs of Lisbeth's iBook processor.

So obviously, and because I skimmed most of the pointless decription of the evil-Wennerwhatever companies various worldwide holdings, we're renaming them and it should have to do with meat products).Wow that was a long... well, whatever these: \"(...)\" are called.Where were we? Oh yeah, I can't fathom why I dredged through pointless drivel about WINNERSTRUMENSAUSAGES when none of it was relevant to the actual take down of the company via Daniel Craig's \"HA IN YOUR FACE\" article, besides giving the author and excuse to dress Lisbeth up in wigs and give her fake boobs. Multiple pages devoted to backstory upon backstory of Vanger family history when we only meet 3 characters more than once, none of them are interesting or move the plot forward, and the \"GASP!

LSDKFJ:LSKDJF:LKDSJF:LSKDJFL:DSKFJ:LKJDF:LSDKJF!I don't know why I'm so angry about this novel except I can't believe I just spent four hours finishing something that had no lasting effect other than making me feel that Sweden is a magical place (if you can avoid the 50% of the population that hates women) where almost everyone is having a lot of open relationship type sex with everyone else, no one has been taught to make an easily digestible and good tasting sandwich, and yet no one is ever constipated.

The most detestable collection of people you will ever meet. My family.\"Translated from Swedish by Reg Keeland \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson\" is a crime sensation since the day it was released. The story starts when Mikael Blomkvist - an investigative journalist - is invited by the head of one of the Swedish's wealthiest families to investigate a family tragedy that happened nearly forty years ago. Harriet Vanger - the niece of Henrik Vanger - disappeared forty years ago and to this day the disappearance remains a mystery. Mikael Blomkvist along with his prodigy partner, Lisbeth Salander, sets on an investigative journey that will lead them to the dark corners of human mind filled with corruption, lust and anger.The thing with big books is that they tend to be on a slower side in the beginning but if you're someone who reads big books constantly then you'd know they have so much to offer once you're past that initial phase. Same is the case with this one, I have seen people mentioning that they had a hard time getting into the book but for me it was an instant page turner the moment I picked it up. I don't know why but something about this story wouldn't let me stop reading it. I realize that, yes, the story is slow in the beginning but I will urge you to bear with it if you wanna witness one of the greatest crime novels ever written. As the book was originally published in Swedish and we know a lot can be lost in translation but I never felt anything like that when I was reading it. I don't know what qualifies for a good writing, whether it's poetic prose or something else but for me the writing is good as long as it is easy to read and has a flow and this book doesn't lack in any of those.Lisbeth Salander who is one the protagonists of this thriller is one the most profoundly written character you'll ever find on paper. Even after being socially awkward and having no empathy, she'll make you fall in love with her which shows the ingenuity of her character. After having read so many \"supposed strong female protagonists\" in books, the respect for Lisbeth has only increased in my eyes because in my opinion, that is how you write a strong female lead.Like Salander, the plot of this book is also multi-layered which Larsson peels off at the right moments to keep you at the edge of your seat till the ending. As for a story that is laced with the theme of sleuth, this book doesn't over emphasizes on shocking the audience but rather relies on revealing the dark side of human nature and for that alone, it deserves an applaud.

Like with some other books, things really start moving around the middle, and the Wennestr\u00f6m case bookends the story neatly (he used to (view spoiler)[work for the Vangers, but had to leave after causing much trouble; the information bait wasn't really of use, but certainly motivated the pair in finishing him (hide spoiler)]). There is a number of men that fit with the original title of the book, \"Men Who Hate Women\", like certain Vanger men ((view spoiler)[especially Martin, Gottfried, and Harald, but no doubt also at least Birger (hide spoiler)]), Wennestr\u00f6m, Lisbeth's father, and the one who replaced Lisbeth's (view spoiler)[previous carer, who got his punsihment - Mr Bjurman (hide spoiler)]. But another group which balanced these are men like Mikael (who while good in bed with *many* women never gets pushy in getting them there), Erika's husband, Holger Palmgren (you wish he'd have had more time and health), and Lisbeth's employer, Dragan Armanski.The climax of the book is quite short (about 20 pages), and the signs of its approach (the threats) happen very near it, so it was not hard for me to keep reading - I read way more than usually do with these kinds of books.

The pacing was great, the actress who played Lisbeth Salander nailed the role and all the Financial Journalism nonsense was obliterated. Even the Blomkvist-Cecilia love affair was not seen. The movie has awesome camera shots and it was a very good adaptation of the book. Even made the book amazing in my eyes. Now I'm really confused why I don't think that the book was awesome when I read it. Well I'll just blame it on the author's writing. I'll caution on some disturbing rape scenes, nudity, foul language and violence on women though. (R-18 and not for sensitive audience.)*** Book Review:Caution: The book contains rape, incest and misogyny, if you don't like to read a book that sick and disturbing don't read this. Review may contain spoilers. Pros:1. The book is a mystery/crime/suspense/thriller ergo a breath of fresh air for a reader of paranormal, fantasy and romance genres.2. The book has an interesting heroine in the name of \"Lisbeth Salander\" who was four feet 11, antisocial, anorexic and has no boobs, but inspite of that was an exceptional hacker with a photographic memory. Not to mention she got piercings and tattoos that's why she's so bad ass. (She's the girl with the dragon tattoo so to speak.)3. Cool thing was the murderer uses Bible verses and then parodied it into his crimes.4. The book also talks about hacking and you will also learn a thing or two about poisons.Cons:1. I hated books that have slow pace and definitely this book was slow as a slug. The action sets in only on the second half of the book.2. Pointless, pointless details! The author would describe clothes, sandwiches, and writes just anything the character was doing (drinking coffee, jogging or reading a particular book).3. The casual sex! Blomkvist would have sex with Berger and then later on would also have sex with Cecilia and then much later on would have sex with Lisbeth. Surprisingly no one got Syphilis at the end.4. The book talks a lot about Financial Journalism wherein from the first chapter had irritated me because I don't have a f****** clue what they're talking about and I don't even care about Financial Journalism that it really makes me bored to sleepiness (I even skimmed on the epilogue because I really don't give a damn). 5. Plot too many (to put it simply).6. Rape scenes of Lisbeth was SICK!7. Predictable and cliche: - Blomkvist go to Martin's House - Martin locked Blomkvist on the basement - Martin was the murderer. - Just as about the murderer would kill Blomkvist, Lisbeth came. - Blomkvist was saved of course. - Martin escaped. - Lisbeth followed Martin's car on the road using her motorcycle. - Martin's car was hit by the truck (talk about ANTICLIMACTIC!)8. The Mystery ended with this: Gottfried was a sick murderer, he loves killing women, he taught his son Martin about it too. Martin also loves killing women too. Gottfried rapes her daughter Harriet. Harriet killed his father. Martin witnessed the incident. Martin rapes her sister. Harriet cannot tell anyone about it because Martin would tell everyone that she kills their father. Harriet was not murdered when she disappeared on Hedesby Island, she only escapes, she was alive and she was living on Australia using Anita's identity. (I was disappointed by it because I was really expecting she was murdered and the murderer was a genius to hide the evidence, but it was just Harriet escaping WTF!) ___________________________________________________________________I'm so happy I've found a copy on Booksale for only Php130.00!", "num_likes": 25, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["disappointing-books", "contemporary-fiction", "watched-it", "author-was-possessed", "books-to-movies", "own", "realistic-fiction", "adult", "reviewed", "don-t-judge-me"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1285169636", "review_id": "1285169636", "date": "Jan 17, 2021", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Victoria Smith", "user_url": "/user/show/24290232-victoria-smith", "text": "This was an awesome story.

I had grown bored when I watched the DVD based on the novel and thus had little expectation for the book. Our book group usually does not choose thrillers. But I was surprised because the novel is indeed a page-turner. I couldn't put it down.There are at least three interrelated stories in this yarn of a book which is primarily set in Sweden early in the 21st Century. The two major characters are Michael Blomkvist, a liberal financial journalist who aims to expose corruption in large companies and Lisabeth Salander, the title character, a gifted but troubled young woman of 24 who is under the guardianship of the state but who is a whiz with computers and at investigation. As it progresses, much of the book involves the unlikely professional and personal relationships that develop between Blomkwist and Salander.As the book opens, Blomkvist has just been sentenced to a short prison term for libeling a major industrial tycoon named Wennerstrom. (Libel laws obviously are much more stringent in Sweden than in the United States where this scenario whould have been most unlikely.) At the trial, for reasons that stay obscure for much of the book, Blomkvist declines to defend the accusations he had leveled against Wennestrom and loses his case and his reputation. He and Salander investigate the case further as the book proceeds.The other mystery plot is much more interesting and well- developed. When he loses his libel case, Blomkvist is summoned to a remote island in northern Sweden by an aging industrialist named Vanger. Vanger offers to pay Blomkvist a substantial sum to investigate the disappearance of his young niece Harriet in 1965, nearly 40 years earlier. At that time, Harriet was a girl of 16. She disappeared mysteriously after a festival, when the attention of the island residents was diverted by an automobile crash on a bridge leading to the mainland. Vanger has spent much of his life, since Harriet's disappearance investigating how she died and who killed her. He has had no success. Blomkvist reluctantly becomes involved. As the story progresses, Salander comes to assist him in this investigation and in the separate investigation of Wennerstrom.The story of Vanger is complex, chilling, and tawdry. It basically involves the entire Vanger family, many of whose members live on the island and dislike each other intensely. The investigation of Harriet and her fate take up most of the book.The story is for the most part well-paced and carefully constructed. There is a large group of characters, including Blomkvist's married lady friend, the various Vangers, the Vanger's lawyer, and especially Salander.As the book develops, the scene shifts from one character and place to another. Tension builds throughout, and the story can be readily followed with its twists and turns without getting confused. There are some chillingly evil scenes in this book.The pace of the book flags towards the end. The Vanger-Harriet part of the story resolves substantially before the book concludes, and the focus of the story returns to Wennerstrom and his claimed financial manipulations and corruptions. This portion of the story is much less interesting than the companion story, and it drags on too long. It seemed to me anticlimactic. The Wennerstrom story and the Vagner-Harriet story both form the occasion for a good deal of preaching on the subjects of sexual exploitation and abuse and large capitalistic corruption and irresponsibility. Ordinarily, I am wary of books with these kinds of ideological preoccupations. But in this case the themes were integrated convincingly into the story the author had to tell. Thus, these themes did not interfere with my enjoyment of the book. I did not find the novel ideologically driven.This was a long, riveting book, which I took up half-heartedly but found I could not put down. I am not sure that the remainder of the trilogy is for me, but I found this book fascinating and well-worth the attention both that I gave it and that the book has received.Robin Friedman", "num_likes": 24, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400556886", "review_id": "1400556886", "date": "Feb 20, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Naddy", "user_url": "/user/show/35112891-naddy", "text": "Being a bibliophile I always like to read all type of genre be it fiction, historical fiction, mystery, classic not much into romance though, but I have always like mystery genre when it comes to say which genre I love the most, I always think I am a mystery fanatic, having read close to 100 books, it make me wonder how come I didn\u2019t get chance to read this mystery so far.

I started it bit slow, the pace till 70 pages was extremely low, there were few pages which I need to re-read I had the idea that it was translated from Swedish -> English so, there can be some part, which could have been difficult to translate, starting from Plot, it started with two different characters, one is young computer hacker sporting an assortment of tattoos and body piercings and has been under state guardianship in her native Sweden since she was thirteen. She supports herself by doing deep background investigations for Dragan Armansky, who, in turn, worries the anorexic-looking Lisbeth Salander is \"the perfect victim for anyone who wished her ill.\" Salander may look fourteen and stubbornly shun social norms, but she possesses the inner strength of a determined survivor. She sees more than her word processor page in black and white and despises the users and abusers of this world. She won't hesitate to exact her own unique brand of retribution against small-potatoes bullies, sick predators, and corrupt magnates alike, she avoid social contact. Her encounters with their guardian were totally spine chilling and riveting. On the other hand we have, Mikael Blomkvist who has just been convicted of libeling a financier and is facing a fine and three months in jail. Blomkvist, after a Salander-completed background check, is summoned to a meeting with semi-retired industrialist Henrik Vanger whose far-flung empire is wholly family owned. Vanger has brooded for 36 years about the fate of his great niece, Harriet. Blomkvist is expected to live for a year on the island where many Vanger family members still reside and where Harriet was last seen. Under the cover story that he is writing a family history, Blomkvist is to investigate which family member might have done away with the teenager.  While this two stories were moving totally different, I was sure about one thing their paths will cross for sure but didn\u2019t know where how when, one thing that make The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is totally out of box is that - shocking sexual violence primarily against women but not excluding men. Salander and Blomkvist both confront prima facie evidence of such crimes. Rape, child abuse, family issues, family politics, exploitation of women, in all sections of society, rich, poor, even at orphanage was told; several cuts are there and each one is deeply plotted. At times, it feels the book is reaching toward end, but then it takes the U-turn. Last 200 pages has been immensely loveable, I loved it, I totally devoured it. After completing book, I watched the movie have to say I didn\u2019t enjoy it much, I felt many characters are missed. This is the book which is truly something not to be missed, and will not soon be forgotten. I would love to continue the series. And it can be explained as Posthumous debuts are a rarity. In the last, I would say the book lived upto its hype.

(The beginning and ending is almost another story all together!) Bestselling The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo begins with investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist being hung out to dry for a piece he wrote that went horribly wrong. Through much of the beginning and to a lesser extent, the ending when Blomkvist gets his revenge for the happenings in the beginning, my eyes began to cross at the seemingly pointless blahdy blah blah of Larrson explaining how Blomkvist got into his current predicament. But really it was Blomkvist's desire to hide away from his circumstances that made him accept a job offer from eccentric former captain of industry, Henrik Vanger- a frail old man haunted by the disappearance of a long gone relative- that brings us to the exciting part. So I guess I can make the bridge as to why it began the way it did.Meanwhile we get to meet Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but socially awkward researcher for a private investigator, who just happens to be assigned the task of investigating Blomkvist for the Vanger family. She\u2019s secretive, sullen, punked out, and- of course- tatooed , but she does a helluva job. However, she finds herself distracted from her assignment when her guardianship is changed and taken over by a loathsome individual. (An individual on whom she exacts some spectacular revenge! At this point in the novel, I literally sat up, bug-eyed then dug in and didn\u2019t look up till my eyelids refused to stay open late into the night!)Indeed it was this insight into her character the ignites the novel and doesn\u2019t let up until the ending, especially when she eventually joins Blomkvist covertly re-investigating the mystery surrounding Vanger's beloved niece's death under the guise of writing his familys\u2019 checkered history. Murder, intrigue, sex and violence- what more can you ask for in a mystery-thriller? It\u2019s no surprise this little beauty been hitting the must read/bestseller lists for forever now. (Btw, this part of the story totally reminded me of a Criminal Minds episode, one of my favorite shows!)Through his body of work, Larsson brutally exposes obvious purveying attitudes of violence toward women and antisemitism... attitudes being swept under the carpet of Swedish society. I love how he boldly empowers Lisabeth in a way few women would have the intelligence and courage to pull off, yet wraps her in a vulnerability that many woman can relate to. The second protag, Blomkvist, is a man-ho to be sure, but something about his innate nobility makes him extremely likeable too. If it wasn\u2019t for the slooooooow beginning I would have totally given this a 5 star.

Well, after finishing this first book in the series, the paperback editions of the second and third book are already placed on my shelves, so ... yes, you can guess that I enjoyed it immensely.Most things about this book which might be criticized or praised have already been stated in other reviews, so I don't think it would make any apparent difference if I repeated those aspects in my review. Stieg Larsson's down-to-earth writing style was sometimes irritating to read because of a lack of emotional binding which Larsson was not able to fully create. However, I started to like Lisbeth Salander early on and became very interested in the fates of other characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Erika Berger in particular, but also realistically portrayed characters such as Henrik or Cecilia Vanger.The best thing about this book was the mystery, its background and the consequences arising from the huge reveal. If you haven't read the book before and start reading it, don't even try to guess the mystery's solution. For me, it was unpredictable and shattering at the same time. As soon as I began to realize how shocking the reveal was about to become, I couldn't put this pageturner down again.After the huge turning point, more than one hundred pages were necessary to finish the story, which Larsson might have done differently in my opinion, since the ending was a lot slower to read than the climax, but I'm not disappointed at all. And the most important thing - Lisbeth Salander is one of the most impressive characters I've ever encountered. I've read some reviews complaining about the lack of a matching family tree and/or map of the fictional Hedeby island where most of the action takes place. Fortunately, both were provided in my edition, so I was always able to follow the story's locational course. In general, you shouldn't expect to find any plot holes in this first part of the \"Millennium\" trilogy. It sometimes becomes boring (mostly during the first hundred pages which provide a lot of necessary information, but never truly interesting or stunning stuff), it sometimes becomes too fast-paced, but never do any of the incidents in this book lack a logical explanation.There is a lot of graphic violence in this book, but if you love a well-written crime/mystery/thriller book with excellently developed characters and an intense back story which will leave you speechless and shocked, then I can't recommend reading it enough.Now on to the second book in the series.

Seriously?I'm not saying it's bad. It's not. This is a book about a petite asocial hacker girl, a mystery, and a bunch of Swedes who enjoy open sandwiches and having sex with each other. Salander is a reasonable and likeable secondary protagonist, insofar as she is just alien enough to be intriguing without being offputting. She doesn't, you know, eat babies.

Except 50 pages in or so he himself was so mind-numbingly bored that he stopped the financial nonsense and bent the story into a more conventional murder mystery... only to pick up the financial nonsense in a protracted denouement.

It was a non-issue, as Larsson had a straight ahead, no frills narrative. That settled, I started looking--involuntarily, almost subconsciously--for comparisons. The novel opened on a single, particularly-interesting aspect of greater mystery before expanding outward, similar to the way John Dickson Carr used to set up his stories. This is not that. Then with each character introduction we got entire backstories, reminiscent of the paperback originals John D. MacDonald wrote in the 50s. Not that either. It turns out it only felt like the entire backstory. There were many facets left to reveal as Dragon Tattoo became its own thing. Of course the novel had its own identity all along; the other perceptions were mine alone.The story opens as recently disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired by Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger to solve the disappearance and presumed murder of his brother\u2019s granddaughter, whom he loved as if his own daughter, thirty-six years earlier. The driving force behind the arrangement is time: Vanger has little left and Blomkvist has nothing but, as his loss of credibility currently prohibits him from working with any effectiveness at his profession. Unknown to Blomkvist, before being offered the assignment he had been thoroughly investigated by a freelance researcher for a prestigious security firm, Lisbeth Salander, for whom the novel is titled. We follow both characters. They each have particular talents, and Salander specifically has endured some extreme hardships.Time is also applicable when describing the book itself. It is well over 600 hundred pages and the story covers more than a year. This is not a detriment. Larsson makes each scene feel like just another day in the lives of his characters, and this continues to hold as extraordinary things begin to happen, some of which will include violent confrontations and harrowing experiences. He neither builds toward each act nor floods the aftermath with relief. Instead he allows only as much emotion as the viewpoint character is feeling and no more--an effect that makes it feel as if these events were actually happening across the street from our homes rather than in a dramatic presentation. This lack of structural manipulation also permits him to expose the killer with a good quarter of the book left. By then the reader has been conditioned. We gladly come along as other elements in the story are leisurely closed out. It\u2019s just the next day in their lives.Which makes it all the more sad that Stieg Larsson did not live to enjoy his worldwide success. He died shortly after delivering three completed manuscripts, of which this is the first. I\u2019m grateful that it was three and not one. Perhaps the publishing model is different in his country but I can\u2019t imagine an American publisher printing a single book; they would want the prospect of slowly building the readership with later additions to the inventory and access to the writer for publicity.

Loved it. It might have something to do with the incredibly LOW expectations that I had going in. For whatever reason, I refused to buy into the hype - only because the hype was so huge. I haven't exactly had a great track record when it comes to \"blockbuster\" books but I did my best to keep an open mind. I'm not particularly coming off as a snob - the amount of books I've read will clear that up - I just have been let down in the past. Most of the praise has been directed towards \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\" herself, Lizbeth Salender. I can understand it, she's a very strong female lead and I enjoyed her throughly but to me, she's pretty much on equal footing with Blomkvist. The two make a terrific team, it'd be hard to imagine one without the other. The fact that it's a trilogy is a little confusing to me - things are wrapped up pretty clearly at the end of this book. There are a few things left unanswered - but nothing major. That being said, I'm pretty happy that I get a chance to read about these characters two more times. There's talk about farming out the characters to another writer once the trilogy is over as Larsson passed away in 2004 - but I don't see the point.*** Not everything needs to go on forever.

Next to it was \u201cIf Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor,\u201d by the renowned thespian Bruce Campbell. Of course I might yet again read \"The Best of H.P.

I logged into my iTunes account and downloaded Steig Larsson\u2019s \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u201d onto my older, yet still efficient, iPod.The iPod had been developed in 2000 but not placed on the market until 2001. I was born in 1977 so I would have been 23 or 24 back then. Now, the time was late summer of 2014, and since I was born in autumn of 1977 I would be 37 in two months. I grew up in Port Jefferson Station, NY but was born in the neighboring village of Port Jefferson as Port Jefferson Station had no hospitals, while Port Jefferson had two: Mather Hospital and St. Charles. I was born in St. Charles Hospital, as Mather Hospital did not tend to natal needs (neither pre- nor post-), and is now renowned for both its cardiac and bariatric surgery centers (fortunate, no?)Incidentally, an American Rock Star named Elvis Aaron Presley donated some funds to St. Charles Hospital\u2019s many years back, as attributed to him on a 1x4-inch plaque located on the wall near the back elevator. (I would insert a joke here, but Larsson\u2019s writing doesn\u2019t allow for much humor. He was very serious. Before I ever saw a picture of him, I knew he\u2019d be a dough-faced man-boy, with steel rimmed glasses.) Port Jefferson was called Drowned Meadow back in the days of the American Revolution. It lies on the Long Island Sound, and on a clear day you can see Connecticut several miles across the water. The Port Jefferson, NY/Bridgeport, CT Ferry line has hundreds of travelers each day, thousands more during the busy summer season. My parents once took the ferry from Port Jefferson to Bridgeport soon after they married. They were married in 1976. As I was born in 1977, that would have made me negative 18 months old at the time. I don\u2019t remember much of it. Anyway--NO! I can\u2019t do it! I did not like this book enough to get that snarky about it. It bored me. And then angered me, and then bored me, and then angered me because it was boring me. I\u2019m not that talented a reviewer to skewer a book I hate by launching into an insightful parody.I will however launch into an inciteful tirade!I found BR Meyer\u2019s \u201cA Reader\u2019s Manifesto an Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness in the American Literary Prose\u201d to be a useful gauge in analyzing the Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo. No, TGwtDT was not published in the US, but it did become a blockbuster-literary-phenom here, so I feel using that book is appropriate. What differentiates books like \u201cThe Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\u201d from other lengthy blockbusters like, say Gone Girl is that the former takes itself much too earnestly to be appreciated. TGwtDT is a bestseller, yes, but it deals with a serious topic that NO OTHER BOOK has touched: violence against women!I read a review of TGwtDT that derided readers who complained the book was too slow, and chided readers for not knowing how to skim over the unimportant parts! That\u2019s how REAL readers read, don\u2019t you know! Look, I\u2019m no speed-reader, but I\u2019m a believer in that words have meanings. They exist for a reason. If I skim a lot, it\u2019s a sign that the author has lost my interest. This belief seems to be confusing for some. Like the literary critics in Meyer\u2019s manifesto write: \u201c\u2018If anyone has earned the right to bore us for our own good, it\u2019s [NAME REDACTED],\u201d writes Salon Martha Russo. \u201cSince [HE] is smarter than we are,\u201d intones John Leonard in the New York Review of Books, \u201ctrust [HIM].\u201dSuch is the early 21st century mindset about LITTER-A-CHORE.Since I do not own the physical version of TGwtDT, and don't intend to everagain listen to the audio, I cannot quote verbatim from his book. So I will borrow from Myer\u2019s manifesto when he criticizes Cormac McCarthy\u2019s tiresome writing from one of McCarthy's later works: \u201cHe ate the last of the eggs and wiped the plate with the tortilla and ate the tortilla and drank the last of the coffee and wiped his mouth and looked up and thanked her.\u201dReplace eggs and tortilla with sandwiches and bread and add in even more copious amounts of coffee, and there you have about 10%-15% of Larsson\u2019s book. It\u2019s tedious.As TGwtDT deals with rape and murder, it\u2019s not unusual that there would be explicit scenes depicting this. (view spoiler)[ Lisbeth Salander is raped by her social worker two various times, one orally in his office and the second time anally in his home after he has tied her to his bed. (hide spoiler)] These scenes are written in a slightly horrific, yet detached manner. It\u2019s not these scenes that I question; it\u2019s the revenge scene that follows. (view spoiler)[ Lisbeth turns the tables on the social worker when she returns to his home, \u2018promising\u2019 another night of sex for pay, then tazes him, ties him to his bed and rapes him. But the way the scene is written is done in an oddly titillating manner. Lisbeth stands at the foot of the bed, dressed all in black, wielding a whip, with her dyed-black hair, tattoos and piercings giving her a dark dominatrix look as the man struggles against his bonds and ball-gag. Lisbeth proceeds to rape him with an anal plug without the use of lubrication. She then tortures him by tattooing a message across his abdomen. Lisbeth finally ends his torture by showing the man a video that she recorded from the previous encounter when he had raped her. For an hour and a half she forces him to watch this! Frightening stuff, one would think, but the way it\u2019s written is done in such a kinky manner, that I\u2014a long time reader of subtle kink\u2014can spot it when I see it.  (hide spoiler)] This scene is supposed to be critical to the novel as it shows the true nature of Lisbeth and the depths she is capable of. (view spoiler)[But to me, it reads as a writer\u2019s fantasy of being dominated by a tough woman. It's more like, \u201cYes, I am a bad, bad, evil man. I am a filthy dirty man, and I must be punished. I understand you will stick painful things up my bum without lube. Oh, it hurts, oh it\u2019s painful...but\u2026now\u2026I am in a quiet, almost hypnotized state of ecstasy at your masterful female dominance. Oh\u2026yes I will do whatever you say. I will be your slave.\u201d (hide spoiler)]Many years ago I read Jane De Lynn\u2019s Some Do where a similar scene is portrayed. (view spoiler)[After a friend is brutally raped and dies as a consequence, several women avenge that savagery by raping her attacker. However in Some Do, the scene was disturbing. The man is assaulted in his office, blindfolded and gagged, and there is not even a sniff of subtly or eroticism; it was pure female anger at masculine \"oppression,\" replete with horror and a lust for vengeance. (hide spoiler)] Some Do was written by an American woman in the 1970s and TGwtDT was written by a Swedish man in the 2000s and there was just a vast difference in the way the parallel scenes were depicted. One was written with a raw anger beneath it, filled with a sentiment of \u201cWe\u2019re not taking this anymore! We will fight back and hurt you worse if you hurt us!\u201dLarsson, it seems, wrote his book as an aggrieved male figure for all the violence committed against woman by men as a dark-revenge fantasy. (view spoiler)[The initial rapes of Lisbeth were crude, but didn\u2019t disturb me. That sort of sexual violence is de riguer in murder-mystery books, sad to say. But it was Lisbeth\u2019s scene where I had my \u201cepiphany.\u201d  (hide spoiler)] As a person, I can\u2019t judge Larsson, but as a reader judging an author, I certainly can. His character of Lisbeth is not a true woman: she is an amalgam of all that is cool and \u201cballsy\u201d about women in media: a cartoon/manga/movie/porn version of what a \u201ckick-ass woman\u201d is. Ironic that in a book originally titled \"Men Who Hate Women\" Larsson used a female protagonist who is a caricaturized version of post-modern ideal femininity to conquer all the bad evil men. (Or perhaps Larsson WAS so smart he knew exactly what he was doing? Maybe. Even so, I didn\u2019t care.)Eh, if you\u2019re going to market a mass-murder/rapist book as feminist theory, at least make it a teeny bit based in realism. And interesting.And I apologize to Dan Brown for all the mean things I said about him. I won\u2019t take them back, because they\u2019re true! But in the literary sense, I should have kept it all in perspective. There\u2019s being a hack who knows he\u2019s a hack, and then there\u2019s being a hack that\u2019s pawned off as some literary genius. And then there\u2019s the fact that he died relatively young, so like Kurt Cobain, no one can EVER complain about Larsson\u2019s talent. Ok, that last part WAS cruel. But I won\u2019t take that back, either.Awful, awful and boring. \u00bd star ", "num_likes": 17, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["mystery-thriller", "heroine-hate-her", "fiction", "hero-hate-him", "own", "overrated", "reviewed", "incest-semi-incest", "characters-hate-them-all", "heroine-feisty-in-a-bad-way"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/195729033", "review_id": "195729033", "date": "Aug 07, 2011", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Lisa Kay", "user_url": "/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay", "text": "Leptospermum rubinette ~ Desert Snow\n\nAudio Review Note: While well narrated by Simon Vance, even he couldn\u2019t save the first part; however, he was very entertaining for the rest and does a good job differentiating the voices. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729 I have made several aborted attempts to read this international bestseller without success, so finally, when it became Book of the Month in one of my GoodReads groups, I decided to listen to it on audio. \nHa!\n I still ended up referring to the paperback copy so often that now I feel as if I\u2019ve read the book twice.

It's richly populated with distinct and memorable characters and it has a driving narrative style that left me never wanting to stop reading for the night. That's a rare talent for a writer to have, and even some great writers do not have it, the gift of being able to compel readers to turn just one more page. The titular girl, Lisbeth Salander, is a fascinating construct, a character with mysteries of her own beyond that of the plot, and she is an intriguing creation, one who as a fictional human being resists sentimental responses yet as a fictional device demands them. Both her personality and her intellectual gifts as depicted engage the reader intensely, and she is well matched with the investigative reporter Mikhael Blomvitz, a linkage which, while quite different in the details, reminds one of those between Archie Stout and Nero Wolfe or John Watson and Sherlock Holmes. Individually, each might be insufficient to the tasks of the plots or to the requirements of literature, but in combination is made a thing greater than the sum of its elements. The mystery at the heart of this book is far-fetched yet ultimately satisfyingly authentic, and the great twin drivers of exciting fiction, resolution and revenge, are effectively utilized.

I hate reviewing favorite books. There's something about the headspace you get in when you're reading one. It's just so passive and full of unthinking pleasure. I just let books happen to me when I'm like that. And I don't want to talk about it okay! It's private.I loved this book back when I first read it, and then again when I re-read it a couple years later, and now I love it again on this third read. Lisbeth Salander is just such a great character, complex and thorny, and very human. The world of finance and murder Larsson brings to life is weirdly fascinating. And it's got a great mystery/thriller plot mixed in with all the rest of the stuff. Blomkvist, I like, but I would also want to punch him a little if I met him in real life, so there's some nice cognitive dissonance in there as well. (He's a kind man with an appealing sense for justice, and he's very good at what he does, but oh my god he just sees a lady and needs to have sex with her, all the time and I do not understand him in that way at all. Although one of the things I like most in this book is that Lisbeth comes on to him, not the other way around; he's perfectly content to keep their relationship professional.)I enjoy the movie adaptations (and one of the comic adaptations; the other is an abomination) but there's no substitute for Stieg Larsson's phenomenal gift for cramming gobs of details into his story, and still keeping it interesting. Starting the second book re-read today, which is why I'm finally writing this \"review.\"February 2012: This is my second time through the Millennium trilogy, so I'm going to try and keep this review short and to the point.Everybody and their mother knows the story by now, or at least they should. Mikael Blomkvist, disgraced journalist, is hired by one of the richest men in Sweden to find out what happened to his sixteen year old niece, Harriet Vanger, who was murdered over forty years before. Lisbeth Salander, a socially introverted, genius hacker, collides with Blomkvist, and the two form an unlikely partnership. I first read the books back in February 2010, and since then I've seen both film adaptations (Swedish and American) multiple times. I am so familiar with the story by now that I've internalized it. I am completely unable to be objective -- as if I ever was able in the first place -- Salander and Blomkvist are real people as far as I'm concerned, and I think it's a damn shame we won't ever get to hear any more from them past book three.For those of you who haven\u2019t heard plot details \u2014 where have you been? \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say any more about the plot because part of the joy the first time is the discovery of all the twists and turns. What I am going to say is that even though Larsson\u2019s writing may not be stellar*, his imagination more than makes up for it. Lisbeth Salander is one of my favorite characters in literature, ever, and the ways in which he makes use of her to say his peace about the rights of the dispossessed \u2014 specifically the rights of women in male-dominated cultures, and the marginalization of the mentally ill and those that are perceived to be sexually or socially deviant \u2014 ultimately elevates the trilogy beyond mere thriller/mystery status. It\u2019s the reason I can sit here and read it (or watch it) multiple times and still the story will have lost none of its power, despite the fact that I already know all the answers to whatever mysteries it contains.*For instance, lots of people become annoyed when he starts describing in detail meals characters eat, or actions they take that are seemingly irrelevant. I happen to find this quirk of his endearing, and all of those \"irrelevant\" details are a part of what I love about his books.Part of what fascinates me about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo as a first novel in a series is that Larsson kind of sneaks up on you with the point of it. You could very easily read the book and then assume that sequels will follow the pattern set up by the first one, and would focus on Salander and Blomkvist as a team who will solve mysteries like it in the future. Instead, Larsson mainly uses the story of the Vangers as an extended \"meet-cute\" for Salander and Blomkist, and to set up Salander as the protagonist. Her story is the real center of the trilogy. This book is as much about setting up the next two books as it's about itself. Larsson wasn't interested in creating a series of grocery-store mysteries. He was interested in delving into the nitty gritty of Salander's life, and all the meaty stuff comes directly from it. She is the mystery and the challenge, not some murderer du jour.The last thing I want to say is that it puzzles me when people express their disdain for this series by saying it's misogynist. I have to wonder just exactly what kind of reading comprehension those people were taught in school, because these books are the very opposite of misogynist. Just because a story features misogyny as a theme, and characters who act in misogynistic or sexist ways, does not mean that story is espousing those misogynistic viewpoints. I can definitely understand people who simply object to the level of violence and dark sexuality that the book contains, but as far as I'm concerned, all that violence has a very salient point at the end of it.And now I've gone and lied to you about this being a short review. Whatever, I'm going to go make an omelet. - - -February 2010: Wow, this was awesome. On top of having a plot that's a weird mash-up between violent crime (think Law & Order: SVU), corrupt family saga, Raymond Chandler-esque mysteries (The Big Sleep comes immediately to mind), and high-tech thriller (ala Neal Stephenson and William Gibson), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has two of the most well-rounded, interesting, and original characters I've ever read in a thriller. Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are flawed but likable, and the secrets they uncover are disgusting, riveting, and scary. It is large book that reads very quickly.The title of the book in the original Swedish translates roughly as Men Who Hate Women, but the English title is just as apt. It's a pity that Stieg Larsson died before being able to complete more than three manuscripts out of a planned ten. Wikipedia tells me that an unfinished fourth manuscript exists, along with synopses for the fifth and sixth, so it sucks that he's dead (not only for him, because he's not alive anymore), but because I WANT TO READ THEM.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone.

I am officially in love with the character of  Lisbeth Salander.What I liked about this book1.\tIt\u2019s dark, gritty and the violence is not romanticised. I\u2019ve read my fair share of adult books and I\u2019ve found a certain romanticism regarding violence against women. The act is depicted as something based off lust, and sometimes, fake love, but rarely about power. It\u2019s uncommon to read a book written by a man where the violence is raw and un-romanticised so the true horror of such an act is put forward. It was refreshing, to say the least. 2.\tThe characters.One of the strong aspects of this book are the characters, their secrets and their interactions. Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are fascinating characters who play off each other in the best way. Even the secondary characters hold their own, and I can find nothing to criticise regarding character growth and their relationships.3.\tThe story.It\u2019s riveting. Truly, the mystery made me turn the page until I read every last word. Maybe I saw some things coming and maybe a few incidents were predictable, but the overall story was one brilliant detective story with twist after twist to keep you guessing. 4.\tThe writing.I cannot help but praise the writing. I confess that this is one of the few books where the first few pages cemented the 5 star rating in my head as we went forward. I already knew that this book would have a glowing review from me. It was up to Larsson to lose the perfect score I already gave him. Not once did my mental rating waver. The writing is impeccable. This man was meant to be a storyteller. Personally, there\u2019s nothing better than intelligent writing. 5.\tSubject matterI was impressed with the knowledge Larsson shared regarding quite a few topics. I was even more impressed that he took the time to discuss these topics. Besides the obvious murder-mystery and thriller aspect of the book, there were quite a lot of discussions of law, the economy, company and journalistic ethics and online privacy. However, my favourite topic (which should come as no surprise) is that he tackled the question of misogyny and feminism. Larsson clearly condemns misogynistic behaviour, but at the same time, he uses it for entertainment. After all, this entire book was about violence against women.

I even dnf\u2019ed it when I was around 13, as it just went straight over my head! I think it was one I was too young for, as there are some fairly complex financial passages in this, because now at 18, I was thoroughly engrossed in this. It isn't a new favourite, and I'm honestly not sure how to rate this at the moment, but it was a very entertaining read.This book has such a vivid, complex plot, where nothing is ever as it seems. We follow Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who has just been convicted of the libel of the boss of a major corporation. This aspect is quite minor in the grand scheme of things, as it very quickly turns into the mystery of an old disappearance and a race to flee a sadistic serial killer. The financial aspects are quite prominent and took a lot of work to understand, but they fit well within the story. Nobody can be trusted in this, and we doubt the word of characters who would not normally be suspected. Even so, I found myself very surprised by the conclusions.Lisbeth Salander is an iconic character and I can very much understand why. She is an intelligent, no nonsense hacker who relies solely upon herself and can be brutal when she needs to be. I pitied her and how the authorities had treated her, leading to her deep distrust of the police and officials. This mistrust leads to some frustrating decisions in the book. Some of the things that happen to her in this book are absolutely sickening and should carry a heavy trigger warning for those sensitive, and I can honestly say this might be the most uncomfortable I\u2019ve ever felt reading a book. Her relationships with others are fascinating, especially with Armansky, her boss, and Palmgren, her guardian, who both seem like very good people.Mikael Blomkvist is just as complex and dynamic, but I have to admit I just don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s a cheat, he plays with women\u2019s feelings and has no regard for hurting them, he\u2019s an awful father and seems far more devoted to brutal journalism than compassion for those he researches. His relationship with Salander seems quite exploitative. I do appreciate him for being a flawed character, however, and his was an interesting perspective to read from. I found him harder to identify with as he\u2019s a lot older than me, additionally.Shoutout to the Vanger family for being one of the most interesting collections of people I\u2019ve read about, but who would take a very long time to discuss!

It tells me that we have had quite a loss in Stieg Larsson's death. Larsson was a journalist who, as I understand it wrote his novels at home as relaxation. Three were left complete and have been published since his death. I've read that he left another partly completed and outlines and notes for 2 others. This book puts me a little in mind of an older style of writing that was more common maybe 5o+ years ago. The early part of the book introduces us to the players and their circumstances. It sets up the two somewhat interlocking stories (they aren't really \"interlocking\" but they are connected through the players). One story sort of frames the other giving us the rational for Mikael to get involved. Salander is then brought on board as a consequence of these two overlapping situations. My early take? I found the first half or so of the novel a bit slow moving and my interest wandered just a bit. I almost skimmed a part of it, but stayed with it picking up all the story about these background and early events. I've seen others who also said that the book starts out slowly. But stay with it. As Andy Griffith said about the opening of Hamlet \"now all do remember that 'cause you will need it later\". The book sort of \"breaks open about at or just past the halfway mark and things start to come to light and come together. The puzzle pieces begin to make sense and the novel pulls you in...it's one of those (I think) you'll hate to put down.I found the book well written and interesting and while the \"life styles\" of our protagonists are not life styles I could or for that matter have any desire to live, the novel is finely constructed, lucid and \"enjoyable\".

Because after 39 years alas I know myself.***Me reading the book so far: '....financial intrigue journalism Blomkvist yeah yeah....LISBETH! LISBETH! LOOOOVE....swindling setup elderly family retainer yeah yeah....' Picturing Michael Nyqvist does help. Yum. Think I am actually looking forward more to the second book -- the Complete Review complained Lisbeth is 'front and center' in that book and I was like 'DUDE THAT'S LIKE BITCHING THAT THE PONY YOU GOT FOR CHRISTMAS JUST POOPED ON THE LIVING ROOM RUG.' (What bad girl thing? I do not have a bad girl thing.)-- Also, based on the Nordic-type people I know, I bet this little excerpt is a good example of the author's humour buried under the clunk-ass translation: 'That morning he had also had an invitation to celebrate Christmas Eve with the Beckmans in Saltsj\u00f6baden [Moi is ignorant of city's location and also cannot spell it:]. He said no, but thank you, certain that there was a limit to Beckman's indulgence and quite sure that he had no ambition to find out what that limit might be.' (Erika Berger/Beckman and Blomkvist have been lovers for twenty years.) [Ah, apparently Saltsj\u00f6baden is a resort on the Baltic Sea. My, it looks fancy. No, I am not defensive about being an Ugly American.*:]*Yes, I've read that book and know that phrase actually means the opposite of what people think, but sadly the misconception has long since passed into popular use. Pretty good book, tho.***(Very) slightly more coherent review:Finished this last night (reading way too fast as usual) and while it's a lot more conventional than I thought it was going in (family saga! isolated island! locked-room mystery!** Nazi past!) I of course loved LISBETH, and am pining for the sequel to freakin' show up in my mailbox already so I can devour it. I should write up a more formal review -- these are basically notes I made as I went along. I liked it a lot! (duh OBVIOUSLY) Many of the Swedish cultural and historical references totally baffled me -- footnotes would've been nice, or even just an appendix explaining some references. \"Reg\" the translator apparently hand-drew a very nice map, which Vintage didn't include (WTF) so I had to print it out and stick it into my own copy. The style was weirdly clipped -- not a lot of time spent on description of places or people -- while tiresomely prolix in other places (did we REALLY need all those emails near the end?). I think the book could've been trimmed by 200 pp or so easily, but at the same time I enjoyed reading something more discursive with a lot of setup that wasn't slavishly following the 'HOOK your reader within TWO PARAGRAPHS by their EYEBALLS!!!111' ubiquitous writing \"advice\" everywhere nowadays. I'd love to read it in the original sometime, sigh. It was mainly a good fast ride, at least on the surface, altho parts of it still oddly stick in my mind:The book is very much about systemic evil -- the structure of capitalism itself; the historic references to genocide; the way Salander is at the mercy of her guardians, misunderstood and underestimated and abused by courts and clinics and foster families. Sweden, the cliche of the socialist 'nanny state,' is actually dark and dangerous as the fairy-tale forests. Lots of reviewers complained that the framing story of Blomkvist taking on financial corruption was pointless but I think it's included for thematic reasons -- not just to set up the plot of why he would take the detective/researching job, but as an illustration of how things work. This is a novel by an investigative journalist supposedly about how heroic investigative journalism brings down powerful rich criminal organizations which corrupt the system, only he can't do it: Lisbeth is outside the social structures, so she breaks the law and brings the swindler to justice, like an avenging angel. It's the same way she deals with her guardian/abuser, and the murderer. She's the only one who can enact justice because she's outside society and the law, as a rejected, isolated, discarded misfit. She's a self-made Fury. The murderer himself is set firmly within the patriarchal capitalist system as both the CEO of a huge corporation and scion of a completely fucked-up family -- that he's _also_ taught to be a serial killer by his father in abusing his sister is icing on the psychocake. Can I just say how happy I am not to see yet another genius Bach-happy overly cultured pretentious serial killer? (looking at YOU, Hannibal) altho I think this one was still fairly unrealistic given the actual psychopathology....but what the hell, it's a novel. Even the Nazis are brought in -- not so much for shock value but to point out that there were political parties in Sweden (and other countries, of course) which supported them and their ideas long after WWII, and even oh-so-charming Henrik (who actually got on my nerves) admits he succumbed to the lure of the propaganda. No one is innocent. Critics say the book is about how awful men are, or how all the men in the book suck except Blomkvist, which isn't true: Henrik clearly loves Harriet and Erika's husband, while offstage, seems like a good man; Blomkvist himself objectifies women somewhat by sleeping around and the bit at the end about how he judges himself as a bad father (paralleling Gottfried as the ultimate bad parent and Henrik as the good foster-father) is really touching. The hacker Plague and Salander's first guardian also obviously care for and help her. It's about the system, and how systematized socialized misogyny warps everyone trapped within it. I liked how the women wind up in charge at the end -- Erika runs the magazine, Harriet is now restored as the rightful CEO, and of course Salander has all that money. Maybe they'll be able to make some changes.This makes the book sound terribly dry and dull, like a thesis, which of course it isn't. I really liked the absolutely cold, isolated atmosphere Blomkvist is stuck in -- it was described without a lot of fuss but built up very strikingly over pages and pages. I enjoyed the old-fashioned detective work involving the photographs, making a mini-film of Harriet, trying to see what she saw, hunting down the other photographers....(I could practically see that sequence as I was reading it, I bet it'd make a great interlude in the film.) But of course, the main reason I picked the novel up and why I personally think everyone is raving about it is LISBETH, LISBETH, LISBETH. I adored her. She's like the brutal fucked-up 'perfect victim' of the system gone through hell and back to take her revenge as a fallen angel -- and yet she's a real person with too many noserings who never cleans her apartment and binges on pizza. I loved that she was a hacker and had terrible social skills and made people think she was mentally slow and couldn't trust anyone. She's truly vibrant. I loved how flawed she was, too: how she had no sympathy for Martin being abused himself, how she walks away from Blomkvist at the end, the fantastic trap she set for her guardian rather than relying on anybody else. Why would she?If it hadn't been for her I would never have finished this book (well, I probably wouldn't have picked it up at all, but enough people said 'YOU WILL LOVE HER' and they were right). It's way too long -- so much time is spent on trivial little details it was far too easy to skim; I actually hate family sagas; I didn't find a lot of the other characters compelling (I did love Erika -- and Cecilia -- and Isabella was terribly chilling even tho we didn't see much of her); the resolution of both mysteries actually felt somewhat anti-climactic; I prefer novels with more visual detail -- and so on and on. None of it matters, because there is LISBETH. Of course I also loved the Lisbeth/Mikael show and no doubt if I were in fandom I would 'ship' them and write terrible fanfic about it.

Start reading at the wrong time and it just will not do, you will not appreciate it. This book, for me, was one of those. I'm 100% sure that if I read it even 10-15 years earlier the rating would be completely different. And it's not even about the content, because the book is devilishly interesting, it's the style in which the author presented the material.There is no point in describing the essence of the plot - only the lazy didn't hear about this book or even movies (by the way, the Swedish version is better by leaps and bounds), so I better get at it from another side. I want to talk about how the author translated the most common things into a fascinating study of a puzzle which makes human nature. A piece here or there, a fragment in the corner of the table and in the center, and from a gray blurry mass appears a subtle, incredibly complex and eye-catching image - a girl with a dragon tattoo.The interesting fact is that there's not as much of Lisbeth in the book as you'd think the titular character would deserve. Her paragraphs were dosed in such way that it seemed the author was luring you in, making you strive for more. It's sad to realize that the finale to this story (if we ever get one) will be written by different hands, because Stieg Larsson truly was an extremely talented author.`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c. \u041d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f -

Does that count as a spoiler? Who cares, everyone and their mother has read this by now.My issues, however, stem directly from said structure. There is a solid mystery thriller in the middle, but it is sandwiched between an overly drawn out beginning and end. Plot A is a bit meh but then Plot B comes along and things start to get interesting. By the time you make it to Plot C, you\u2019re in for a ride. But then Plot C is resolved and after all the fun you think \u201cOh yeah, I guess we have to go back to solving Plot B now.\u201d It\u2019s alright, but not half as fun as C. And once that is done it\u2019s time to close the circle and wrap up Plot A, but at this point I really didn\u2019t care and just wanted it to be over. It was The Scouring of the Shire all over again. The writing doesn\u2019t contain a drop of literature, which is what made the first and third acts so thanklessly hard to get through. It\u2019s as dry and detailed as an insurance policy. This is clearly the work of a journalist and not of a writer, and I actually admire it as such. Not that we should take the plot to be remotely true (the third act was downright fantasy), but like Dickens and Hugo, Larsson uses the novel medium to raise awareness about real-life problems while entertaining his readers. And it's certainly interesting as journalism (it made me look up info on several things), but as a novel? Not what I'm looking for.I have been pondering a lot on the popularity of Lisbeth Salander. I mean, at this point in time she is larger than life. But having finally read the book I think she\u2019s cool but not someone I\u2019d consider a fictional legend. Larsson set out to write a feminist hero, and she comes very much across as a man\u2019s idea of a feminist hero. And that\u2019s not a bad thing! Larsson, by all accounts, was a manly man (his pastimes included beer and football), so the result of him writing a badass vigilante like Salander is a lot more efficient that if he\u2019d, say, tried to write a more conventionally female character (oh wait, he did, literally every other female character - they suck). A fortuitous decision, in any case, it clearly clicked with many people. As for me, I\u2019m glad to have made the acquaintance, but I don\u2019t feel like I was missing out on that much.", "num_likes": 15, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["thriller", "airport-fodder", "mysteries", "noir", "c-sweden"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/83417153", "review_id": "83417153", "date": "Jan 04, 2010", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Michael", "user_url": "/user/show/752739-michael", "text": "I'm going to warn you right off the bat that I'm going to spoil the hell out of this book, so stop reading this if you care...Let me preface by saying that I'm not really a big fan of quick-read murder/thriller books. I think the one Patricia Cornwall (Cornwell?) I read was an utter waste of time. I have no interest in books with flimsy characters who do brutal things to characters purely for plot reasons. It's really nothing more than a kind of torture porn, and I don't really understand the popularity of serial killers in books or movies. But occassionally, a murder myster/cop book will pop up that is so good, with characters so rich, and by an author who takes the content seriously and with respect, that it defies the rules of the genre. Mystic River is one example. The Long Goodbye is another. Homicide - though nonfiction - is a masterpiece.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is trash.The characters are paper thin. The plot is so contrived. The weight of the horror is so heavy, and dealt with so superficially that I'm not sure this guy ever even thought that rape was anything but a word that could be tossed around lightly. And he only has three or four rapists running around. The story goes on long after I had lost interest, and it took me a while to realize that was because the author had created a horrific serial rapist/murderer merely as a plot point, so that he could get back to the real villian of the piece: a stock market speculator. Seriously.Not that he ever creates that villain as anything more than a straw man. He exists solely so his main protaganist can write a book that not only drags the villain down, but puts plenty of money in his pocket, and revolutionizes the way the media handles financial news, proving the protaganist was always right, even in the face of grumpy old journalists.Um... what?This #$%^ing sucked.", "num_likes": 15, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/104533590", "review_id": "104533590", "date": "May 27, 2010", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Sarah", "user_url": "/user/show/705652-sarah", "text": "I booted up my HP Pavilion PC and launched a Mozilla Firefox browser in order to access www.goodreads.com. I then logged in so that I could write this review of the audiobook version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. (It's not encrypted.) There is a lot of this type of narrative in the book, and I found it to be boring because of it. Larsson just tells, tells, tells without creating any narrative technique or showing any talent for eloquence. Maybe it's the fault of the translator or maybe it's meant to mimic Salandar's lack of sociability, but either way it sure was bland. It came off as perfunctory and lacked any subtlety. In listening to this, I thought it was about to be over multiple times, only to find that the denouement lasts THREE discs.

The first plotline revolves around Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist with a specialty in exposing financial fraud, who has been convicted in the wake of a libel suit. He needs to keep a low profile while his magazine recovers from the blow. The second major plotline relates to the hiring of Blomkvist by Henrik Vanger, an octogenarian executive of a family-owned Swedish corporation, to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of his great niece, Harriet, in 1966 under mysterious circumstances. A substantial sub-plot concerns Lisbeth Salander, an intelligent emotionally-damaged 25-year-old computer hacker, who conducts private investigations for an electronic security company. This unlikely pair teams up to solve both the financial and murder mysteries. Once the groundwork is laid, this novel becomes a plot-driven page-turner. It is filled with the requisite darkness typical of many thrillers such as sadism, grisly descriptions of murder victims, psychopathic behavior, rape, and assault. I found it an interesting mix of unusual suspects, family secrets, financial corruption, magazine operations, and computer technology. I thought the middle portion was most intriguing, as Blomkvist and Salander dig into the past and assemble the puzzle pieces. The characters could have benefitted from a bit more depth, particularly regarding their inner thoughts and motivations. The \u201cwhodunnit\u201d was more convincing than the \u201cwhydunnit.\u201d The author diverts attention from the main story on several occasions, taking the reader down a few blind alleys that, in my opinion, were not required and made this book unnecessarily lengthy. I like to read books that have become sensations, usually many years after their publication. I can see the attraction of the eccentric and damaged computer geek (she of the dragon tattoo) in an \u201codd couple\u201d pairing with the sexually promiscuous but generally well-intentioned journalist. I am not particularly keen on thrillers, so I probably wasn\u2019t the best audience, but I think fans of the genre will appreciate it.

I'd be breaking her trust\"The girl with the dragon tattoo deals with a lot of issues, all can be summed under two major themes, which are:First, Financial corruption. Mikael Blomkvist is a well-known financial journalist. He publishes a story on one's of Sweden's large businessmen but he failed to stand on a solid prove, so he was found guilty and was convicted of libel. Wennerstrom is a symbol of corrupt businessmen, who intended to make profits out of illegal ways exploiting eastern European countries urge to recover after the cold war. \" The Wennerstrom empire of obscure companies was linked to the heart of the international Mafia arms dealing and money laundering for south america drug cartels to prostitution in New York and even indirectly for child sex trade in Mexico\"The second theme deals more with a social crisis \"Violence against women\" . Larsson wrote a statistic in the beginning of each part and chapter and then he set an example through two of his female characters , through whom the reader came to live their misery. 46% of the women in sweden have been subjected to violence by a man  18% of women in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man 13% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to aggravated sexual assault outside of a sexual relationship 92% of women in Sweden who have been subjected to sexual assault have not reported the most recent violent incident to the police. I was curious to know the percentage in the middle east & I was quite shocked According to WHO : 45.6% of females in Africa had experienced abuse. Southeast Asia followed with 40.2%To your information, Sweden occupied the 6th rank in \"The best countries to be women list\" Whilst the worst countries are AfghanistanCongoIraqNepalSudan GuatemalaMali Pakistan And the list goes on & onNow let's get back to the novel. After failing to expose wennertrom's, Blomkvist had no choice but to leave his life in stockholman and his post in Millennium magazine to move to Hedeby, a quite village.Despite being crushed, he Concentrates all his efforts on solving an old mystery of a 16-year old girl who disappeared in a long time ago. However, his battle with wennerstrom isn't over. To tell you truth, Historical mystery is really my thing. How not especially if Agatha Christie is one of my favorite writers. Overall, I enjoyed the whole process of investigations and was satisfied after the mystery was solved.To a great extent, I was convinced that larsson's characters' are so realIt was very slow till the first quarter but then I got hooked in the novel till the last pageThere are two things that I didn't like: First ,one can't deny that it was too long. Details, details and way more detailsSecond, I was extremely annoyed by the \"Casual sex\" in this novel. Is it very common in Sweden to have sex with 95% of the people you meet in your life. It was quite DISGUSTING !!A smart and well-written novel. I intend to read the rest of the series but not around this time.Recommended only for Adult readers as it contains rape and bdsm3.5 stars round up to 4 stars.", "num_likes": 17, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["crime", "mystery", "thriller", "european-lit-not-including-britis"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2008295207", "review_id": "2008295207", "date": "May 23, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Drew", "user_url": "/user/show/22104588-drew", "text": "\n\u201cEveryone has secrets. It\u2019s just a matter of finding out what they are.\u201d\nThis was probably the most disturbing book I've ever read. This makes Gillian Flynn's psychotic thrillers look like bedtime stories. I would rather meet Carrie White with a chainsaw in the middle of a dark road than cross the path of Lisbeth Salander.I debated whether I should give this five stars because of the purely genius writing and masterfully crafted characters and plot - I'm not exaggerating when I say that Larsson is one of the BEST writers I've ever come across - or one star, because this book was so dark and sick I was left wondering why I was still reading it at times. I finished it, thinking: was this a disgusting piece of literature that I would never touch again? Or was it a deeply disturbing, psychological thriller that oh so cleverly played with the reader's mind and left you feeling a little bit sick after you'd finished it?The answer is both. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a genius thriller that tackles screwed-up topics. It reads like a diary, switching POVs often and pulling us into the corrupt lives of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. Blomkvist is a disgraced journalist who gets hired by the wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve the case of Harriet Vanger, who was murdered nearly four decades ago. Blomkvist enlists Lisbeth Salander to help him with the case, a brilliant young woman with a haunted past who may be the best investigator in Sweden.The atmosphere was perfectly fitting for a long-buried mystery - a biting cold winter in Sweden at the huge, wealthy estate of the Vangers with sleepless nights and cups of coffee. As Blomkvist became engrossed in the mystery of Harriet Vanger, digging up old clues about her disappearance and investigating each of the Vanger family members, he found his relationship with Lisbeth becoming more and more tangled. And on top of that, someone seemed to be after him - someone who didn't want him bringing the truth to light.I wasn't kidding when I said this book was disturbing. The characters were utterly corrupt and unnerving - beneath their outside image, they were all deeply unhealthy, bitter individuals. This book also dealt with a lot of sexual assault against women. One scene in particular was so disgusting it made me feel sick. In between chapters, statistics were included about women in Sweden experiencing sexual assault.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a book as disturbed as its main characters. The whole time I felt like I was reading a long, exciting, well-written news article about a topic so revolting I could neither look away nor turn the pages fast enough.

There's several things I really liked about it. The violence, the evilness is never presented in a voyeuristic way. The reader isn't sympathetic to the murderer's POV, only with the victim's. Odd how refreshing that is. Also, the book examines the desire for justice from many angles. It isn't just about seeking Truth, or Prosecution, or even Revenge, the author considers again and again what is best for victims, and their families, and forces all the characters to consider these issues. In that aspect, I'm reminded of Dick Francis, who often ended his books with the prevention of further crime, rather than with prosecution.

Salander stays in my mind.I\u2019m discussing the trilogy first, and then I review this specific book (#1) at the end below. Most of my reviews are romance novels, but this series is not. I only mention it so that other romance lovers might consider it.THE TRILOGY:STORY BRIEF:The three books must be read in order. This is a hugely popular best-selling mystery suspense thriller about a few members of the Swedish national police organization forming a \u201cspecial section\u201d doing illegal things. To shut up a 12-year-old witness, they have her placed in a mental institution. Her name is Lisbeth Salander. Mikhail Blomkvist is an investigative journalist. In book 1, Salander who is now 24 helps Blomkvist solve a mystery about a woman who disappeared. In books 2 and 3, Salander has a variety of problems resulting from \u201cspecial section\u201d activities. A number of interesting characters are involved. Some are helpful and others try to hurt Salander.ABOUT THE TITLES:The primary theme for the books is \u201cMen Who Hate Women,\u201d which is the Swedish title for the first book. I much prefer the Swedish title over the English-language title. The tattoo title feels superficial and meaningless when compared to the Swedish title. The titles in order are:The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Swedish Title: Men Who Hate Women)The Girl Who Played With Fire (Swedish Title: same)The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet\u2019s Nest (Swedish Title: The Air Castle Blows Up) The Air Castle in Swedish means a complex structure based on nothing.REVIEWER\u2019S OPINION OF ALL THREE BOOKS:I want happy endings when I read books, and I was definitely satisfied and happy at the ends of books 1 and 3. I know I will continue to think about Salander and this story well into the future. Book 1 can be read as a stand-alone, but I wanted more Salander so I bought book 2. Book 2 stops in the middle of the story which is ok as long as you get book 3 to keep reading right away. I loved the three books. This is not a predictable, run-of-the-mill mystery thriller. There are a wide range of characters and plot intricacies that are wonderfully well done. I was so taken with these books that I bought the audio versions AND the paper versions for books 2 and 3. I\u2019ve never done that before. That way I could continue with the story when I was driving and doing kitchen work. I would switch to the hard copy when sitting.In the first book, Salander felt like a modern day replacement for Sherlock Holmes, but very different. They both are brilliant in their special skills, and draw my admiration. However, Salander is gritty, edgy, and anti-authority. She despises the police and refuses to allow them to have information about anything. There was a lot of action with Salander in the last half of the first book. I loved reading about her. I was hoping to see a lot of action with Salander in books 2 and 3 \u2013 seeing her solve other mysteries and doing damage to bad guys. But that didn\u2019t happen. Books 2 and 3 are more about other characters doing things \u2013 murders, cover-ups, and investigating \u2013 but it was all surrounding and relating to Salander. She had less action than I wanted in the last two books. But still, I fully enjoyed books 2 and 3.The English-language film of the first book will be in theaters in 2011. Daniel Craig will play journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Unfortunately, as with most movies, there\u2019s no way it will be as rich as the books.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Steig Larsson wrote these three books, submitted them to a publisher, and then died before they were published. He had written half of a fourth book which I believe his girlfriend may be finishing. He had an outline and planned to write several more in the series. I am sad for the loss of the author and for the loss of his further writing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW OF BOOK 1: THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.REVIEWER\u2019S OPINION:I listened to the audiobook version and sometimes found it difficult to keep the names straight. The narrator is good, but there are so many Swedish names (people and towns) that are hard to follow if you\u2019re not used to it. I recommend reading the book (not the audiobook) and taking a few notes with names. I can\u2019t remember if it was the first third or more, but it was slow. It was also setting things up. There is a lot of \u201ctelling\u201d about things happening in the past. The second half is more action and \u201cshowing.\u201d If you look \u201cInside the Book\u201d on Amazon, there is a Vanger Family Tree which is helpful. The last half was fantastic and definitely worth the read. I was surprised, amazed, and couldn\u2019t put it down. It\u2019s creative and excellent. Caution for sensitive readers: there is unsettling rear-door rape and torture.THE MAIN CHARACTER:Salander is haunting, intriguing, and powerful in unexpected ways. She has a terrifying capacity for ruthlessness. She is 24, 4 feet 11, weighs 90 pounds, has tattoos, and looks like a punk teenager. Some of her personality traits appear similar to Asperger\u2019s syndrome, but she is sociable if she wants to be. She is one of the best computer hackers in the country. Her mother\u2019s in an institution. Salander is a ward of the State with a guardian controlling her finances. The State believes she is mentally incompetent. She doesn\u2019t care what they think as long as she can get her money when needed, and they \u201cleave her alone.\u201d She becomes the top investigator for a private investigating firm.STORY BRIEF:Book 1 includes three stories. (1) Salander has problems with guardians and being a ward of the State. (2) Blomkvist is a journalist who printed an article about Wennerstrom, is sued for libel, and will be going to jail for three months. (3) Blomkvist is hired to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, which happened 37 years ago. Blomkvist learns about Salander and hires her to help investigate Harriet\u2019s disappearance which has something to do with a serial killer.DATA:Audiobook length: 16 hours.

Mikael Blomkvist is sentenced to three months in prison, which was deferred, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Soon afterwards, he is invited to meet Henrik Vanger, the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporation, unaware that Henrik Vanger has checked into his personal and professional history. Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply troubled researcher and computer hacker, has carried out the investigation of Mikael Blomkvist's circumstances.Henrik Vanger promises to provide Mikael Blomkvist with evidence against Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m in return for discovering what happened to his grandniece, Harriet Vagner, who disappeared in 1966. Henrik Vanger believes a member of the family murdered her. Harriet Vanger disappeared during a family gathering at the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island, when the island was temporarily cut off from the mainland by a traffic accident on the bridge.Mikael Blomkvist moves to the island and begins to research the Vanger family history and the disappearance of Harriet Vagner. As he does, he meets most of the remaining Vanger clan, including Martin Vanger, current CEO of the Vanger Corporation, Isabella Vanger, mother of Martin and Harriet Vanger, and Cecilia Vanger, a headmistress who was Harriet Vanger's younger aunt and friend, though Cecilia's sister Anita Vanger was closer both in age and friendship to the missing girl.Despite all expectation to the contrary, Mikael Blomkvist identifies new evidence into the disappearance of Harriet Vagner. One clue is a pair of photographs, detailing her sudden discomfort at the sight of a young man in a prep school blazer. Another lies in her journal, which contains a set of five names and five-digit numbers believed to be old telephone numbers.However, Pernilla Abrahamsson, his daughter, identifies them as passages from the Book of Leviticus. They describe rules about the treatment and punishment of women, and Mikael Blomkvist correlates one of them with the grotesque murder of a Vanger Corporation secretary in 1949. Mikael Blomkvist realizes that he may be on the trail of a serial killer, and the scope of the resulting research makes him request a research assistant \u2013 Lisbeth Salander.Lisbeth Salander is a computer hacker with a photographic memory and the titular girl. She was ruled legally incompetent as a child and is under the care of a legal guardian, Holger Palmgren. When he had a stroke, Nils Bjurman, who uses his position to extort sexual favors from her and eventually rapes her, replaces Holger Palmgren. After using a hidden camera to record her assault, Lisbeth Salander takes her revenge, torturing Holger Bjurman and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control of her life and finances. Lisbeth Salander then uses a tattoo machine to brand him as a rapist.When Mikael Blomkvist sees the report she prepared for Henrik Vanger, he realises that Lisbeth Salander has hacked into his computer. He confronts her and asks her to help him with the investigation, to which she agrees. The two eventually become lovers, but Lisbeth Salander continues to keep him at an emotional distance. Together, they continue their investigation and their suspicions are heightened when a local cat is left dismembered on Mikael Blomkvist's porch, and when he is fired upon from a distance during an afternoon jog.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is written rather well. It is a wonderful psychological thriller novel set in Sweden. It started and ended rather slow, but the middle of the book was quite invigorating. The novel perks up as their investigation gains speed, through it was quite difficult determining who's who in the Vanger family tree as there are various cousins, nephews, half-siblings, and the like that seem to populate the family.The last third (thematically) of the narrative seemed to slow down and to really concluded the narrative that started at the beginning with Mikael Blomkvist's dealings with Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m, while not as interesting as the Vanger case, it made a rather nice conclusion, despite it being a tad more boring. I am not sure, if it is the writing or the translation to blame, but this last part was a tad of struggle to finish. Finally, the characters seemed to be subdued or shallow, again not sure if it was the writing or translation or if it is the Swedish culture, but the characterization should be more in depth.All in all, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is written extremely well and is a strong start to what would hopefully be a wonderful series, which I plan to continue in the very near future.", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["mystery", "thriller", "crime"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4326157761", "review_id": "4326157761", "date": "Jan 09, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Fiz|\u0641\u064a\u0632", "user_url": "/user/show/71950525-fiz", "text": "Reviews to come (because uni assignments come first \ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13)", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["adult-fiction", "mystery-thriller-crime"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2610772483", "review_id": "2610772483", "date": "Dec 02, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Diana", "user_url": "/user/show/10479935-diana", "text": "Vid review coming on January, 2nd (2019) https://youtu.be/B33Tlhb_O7M3'5-4\u2605Some parts were boring but the majority was addictive.", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/33963654", "review_id": "33963654", "date": "Sep 27, 2008", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Lisa", "user_url": "/user/show/123380-lisa", "text": "I work in a bookstore and this arrived as an ARC several days before the promotional material, and thusly the hype surrounding it, arrived. I had no idea upon grabbing it that it was to become of falls \"hot new reads.\" That's my story and I'm sticking with it.The back story is this: Stieg Larsson, political journalist and activist in Sweden, completed a trilogy (with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo being the first), which were eventually sold to a publisher. Shortly before the publication of the book, Larsson died of a massive heart attack in 2004. Rumours of his death as not being natural have been swirling, which perhaps have lent greater mystique to the series. The books were published to great acclaim and became international bestsellers. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was released in the U.S. in September, 2008.Mikael Blomkvist, a middle-aged journalist/activist, has been found guilty of libel for a piece he wrote against Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m, a corrupt Swedish industrialist. Blomkvist, known for his insightfully and well researched pieces, leaves his old life defeated and broken. He is contacted by Henrik Vanger, an aging patriarch of a well-connected family to help him with one thing: Solve a 40 year old mystery of the possible murder and kidnapping of the patriarch's beloved niece while working under the guise of researching the Vanger family history. In return, Vanger will hand over evidence to Blomkvist that will nail Wennerstr\u00f6m to the wall for good.What follows is a twisting, complex and at times horrifying, thriller that scourges to the bottom of human nature. As Blomkvist continues to dig into the history of the Vangers, and discovering what actually happened on that fateful day in 1964, the more of the family horrors began to surface. There is a reason why the book was originally published in Sweden under the title, \"Men Who Hate Women.\" Larsson is graphic in his descriptions and at times, the brutality of what he describes is off-putting. One one level, are we really all that innocent or are we just oblivious to what happens around us? Are some family histories better left buried or will redemption come if they are unearthed? One would like to think that not all humans can be as bad as apparently some of the Vanger (and other minor characters laced neatly through the book) can be, but on the other, we hear and see about these horrors in our daily news consumption.Larsson addresses many themes in his novel, good versus evil, love and redemption, self-sacrifice and luck versus chance and fate. Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, has been discussed as an unforgeable character and enlightened character who works with Blomkvist on researching the mystery. What has happened to her, in her life, is as equally shocking and despairing as what occurred within the Vanger family - but Salander is not a victim and she despises those who, in her mind, who are regardless of situation and circumstance. She is a woman whom on some level we all want to be and yet on another, repulse from. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo will pull you in and and keep you hooked until the very last page. Some of the same reviews mentioned early stated that they found the ending incomplete and wholly unsatisfying. On one hand, I can see why that would think that, Larsson's intention for a trilogy (hopefully the next two books will be available in the U.S.) leaves a lot of things unsettled and unfinished. But do not let that dissuade you from reading this novel, it will make you think, act, hope and hug your loved ones close to you.

It isn\u2019t particularly interesting, I guessed the who done it theme within 70 pages, but it isn\u2019t put downable either. It took me a week to finish because I kept picking it up, reading about 75 pages, growing tired as nothing truly exciting ever happens, casting it aside, but feeling guilty about neglecting it, wondering if it would ever reach a break neck pace, and then succumbing to guilt and would begin reading it yet again. It never does change pace, it simply remains consistent in describing the day to day, or week to week happenings of these strangely perverse characters\u2019 lives and the circumstances in which they find themselves. One thing this book did accomplish was to allow me to finally grasp what I don\u2019t like about a majority of adult fiction. The characters are aloof. Even if the characters are colorfully described, as these characters certainly were, I never forgot that I was reading. I never immersed myself in their lives and traveled their journey alongside them as though I was experiencing everything with them. I was aware of ever turn of the page. No matter how well written a book is, as this one is, if I can\u2019t forget myself, I can rate it more than three stars.Stieg Larsson has also proven that female YA authors aren\u2019t the only writers that fall prey to writing wish fulfillment. Mikael was a Gary Stu personified. Here we have a character that is renowned for his moral dealings in the literary world and yet he has had a 20 year affair with his married colleague while he was also married. I must have missed where adultery was the definition of morals. And this moral writing guru is convicted of libel because he failed to check his sources. Shouldn\u2019t an accomplished writer know better? Furthermore, his wang is irresistible to every female character mentioned in this book below the age of 80, even the autistic savant/hacker/bi-sexual. LOL, men. But what really took the cake was the fact that Mikael, a financial journalist, is the one who solves a 40 year old murder case that confounded experts for nearly half a century. Please.I can\u2019t really mention Lisbeth as I don\u2019t truly understand her. She is a strange bird, but I liked her, of reasons I can\u2019t explain. She is an interesting freak show. I have only two qualms with her character. I couldn\u2019t believe that she was autistic, nor could I believe that she would have willingly put herself in the situation she finds herself in with her guardian. Neither contributed to her character development or the development of the plot and I felt as though both mentions were added for shock value purposes. After the above comments, it will probably seem as though I didn\u2019t like the book, but I am glad that I read it. There is something bizarrely enthralling about it that I can\u2019t quite put my finger on. I suppose it\u2019s the mundane mentions of some truly obscene characters. I just don\u2019t know. I suspect it\u2019s a Swedish thing as I felt the same way about Let the Right One In. Wish fulfillment and predictable plot aside, this book is written well.

I intially was interested in the Salander plotline and assumed, based upon the title of the book, that it would play a major role. In reality Salander is a plot piece, not a character. She exists to hack computers and do busywork that the male lead cannot be bothered to do. For a book that gives the appearance of adovcating women's rights Larsson has done an exceptional job of portraying women as reflections of men. Salander, Berger, Harriet and the minor female cast are acted upon by males and respond but their responses never appear to have any impact upon the male charatcers.Perhaps this was Larsson attempting to make a comment about women being exploited in contemporary society, the crime statistics would attest to this. However, if that was the case his attempt failed.The Harriet plotline was weak and illogical from beginning to end. From the first page I assumed that the person sending the flowers was in fact the supposed victim. It took 400 pages of nonsensical rambling plot for my intial thought to be proved accurate. The decision to hire a financial journalist to investigate a supposed murder is never properly explained. Also it is completely unbelievable that although repeatedly stated that anyone with any degree of contact with Henrik knows of his obession with Harriets disappearance yet, in 30 years Anita never told Harriet that Henrik assumed she was dead. The incest storyline seemed needless and the resulting coverup of Martins crimes was nonsensical. The crimes could have been revealed without revealing the incest were it not for the fact that Salander destroyed the evidence of Martin's crimes for no apparent reason. Even after that the photographs and the torture chamber remained as evidence.The Wennerstrom plotline dominated the opening and closing sections of the book but hardly rated a mention in the central portion. This uneven pacing gave the appearance that Wennerstrom was a contrivance that existed merely to give Blomkvist a (ultimately baseless) reason to take the Harriet case. The fact that the entire plotline could be solved by a handy piece of hacking demonstrates the weakness of the premise. The fact that the premise required Wennerstrom to be a complete idiot (depsite the fact he has apparently been getting away with his crimes for many, many years) was similarly discouraging.The 'global financial crisis' should establish a sense of realism within the Wennerstrom plotline and the crime statistics should do so with the Salander or Harriet plotlines but in actuality not one of Larsson constructs feels even vaguely realistic. Each appears to have been set up in order to precipitate the next whilst holding no intrinsic value. The overall effect is the impression of a solid novel but when considered beyond face value you are left with the feeling that it was all smoke and mirrors and wondering what the point was.

Mr. Freud may have a theory written, or even if there isn't, it can be explained by the fame of books/movies about serial killers like Erzsebet Bathory, Jack the Ripper... I just saw there is a list in listopia of Bathory books.Here are few things I want to mention to other readers after reading this book:*It's is either very poorly translated or very poorly written. I'm guessing both. Many repetitions! (spoilers perhaps) *This book contains some of the creepiest things I've read in the novel murder, Nazism, sexual sadism, creepy freakish serial killers, casual sex with crazy twists, incest, rape, really please... I think selection of one or two of the above will do to sell a novel. I admire writers with talents to come up with challenging characters. I just don't get the same spark with this author. Then, I just don't get the name of the book!!! Firstly she is branded by the author. No one is the story calls her \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" as a pet name or something, then Lisbeth Salander only gets active in the main plot after 3/4 of the novel. In the middle, Larsson tries to tell her story but I just couldn't get the connection. I was annoyed. Then all these \"ooh\"s and \"aah\"'s about Lisbeth Salander being a amazing character, please... She is badly written. What makes her unique is her tatoos, tough clothes, numerous piercings etc etc. Hello, it's call branding! I personally feel Larsson had tried to make Salander \"a social freak\".There's more to characterization than outer appearance. She is a unique character, I completely agree but if someone wants to compliment a character who gets social out-cast treatment but is amazingly talented; then should have changed the name of the book.

This is my first 5-star mystery/crime thriller for this year.I believe I have had been putting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo off for a lot many years but when one of my friends got on my nerves (LOL), I had to read and I am so freaking glad I did.This is an INTELLECTUAL story and not one story but a web of stories interwoven.Personally, I think the book shouldn\u2019t be named \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u201d because \u2018The Girl\u2019 here is just a part of the narrative, obviously a substantial part but this book SO MUCH MORE than that!!I was ashamed of myself when I was not able to comprehend the first fifty pages because I was like- What is this corporate crap?? But then it flowed so naturally that I was struggling to spare time because I didn\u2019t want to do anything else but delve into it! I finally found myself glued to this book somewhere in the middle when it actually started to get interesting.So without much ado, I would maybe try to summarise it because it\u2019s too much to be put in a few words--Harriet Vanger, niece of Henrik Vanger, CEO of Vanger Industries disappears out of the blue. Henrik hires Mikael Blomkvist, a reputable Stockholm financial journalist in Millenium, to solve the case.- Lisbeth Salander, a brainy sleuth and a hacker who lends a hand in solving Harriet\u2019s mystery with Mikael. (She\u2019s an amazing character... \u2018S.M.A.R.T\u2019)- Mikael along with his co-owner and occasional lover Erika Berger is already struggling with his corporate affairs with Wennerstr\u00f6m and deeply desires to unmask his corrupt practices.All of this plus a lot of men-who-hate-women stuff covers the whole narrative.This book should be on your TBR as number one read when it comes to Crime fiction or Crime thrillers and anyone who is sensitive to barbarism or violence should try to avoid or not mind the particular part BUT DO READ IT! PLEASE! Haha!I am sad to hear that Stieg Larsson couldn\u2019t write more than 3 books in the series so I am all the more excited to read the next two Stieg Larsson in the sequel.", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["emily-m-inspired"]}, {"book_id_title": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_id": "31111270-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo", "book_title": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/97193276", "review_id": "97193276", "date": "Apr 05, 2010", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Jackie \"the Librarian\"", "user_url": "/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian", "text": "Lisbeth Salander, the girl of the title, is kick ass. And kind of scary. I don't think I'd be friends with her, but I would respect her and never, ever, piss her off. She makes this book worth reading, despite all its other faults. This is not great literature, it's a mess of a book with elements that made me cringe, but I couldn't put it down because of Lisbeth.She almost takes too long to come into the story. Larsson makes us wait, and he almost lost me by starting out not with Lisbeth, but with a framing story about Mikael Blomkvist. Mikael is a reporter on trial for libel against a prominent businessman, and we get to learn a plethora of mind-numbingly dull details about financial shenanigans. For anyone thinking about reading this, don't sweat these details, just skim all this intro stuff quickly to get the basic idea. You won't miss anything.Add to that a thicket of interchangeable (to me, anyways) Swedish names, an intergenerational family with too many members to keep track of that plays a central role, and details about how many cupboards there are in the kitchen that I didn't need to know (although it's cute that the author thinks I might want to know, maybe it's a Swedish thing?) and you have a book crying out for an editor. But I'm glad I persevered.Lisbeth Salander is completely asocial, a computer genius, bisexual, and SO not afraid to use violence. She's a ward of the state with a mysterious past. Just like Mikael Blomkvist, who she joins forces with, we grow fascinated with her, and her ferocity. She's like Dirty Harry, she lives by her own code, which is not necessarily within the law. Something happened to her in her childhood, something evil, but what? WHAT??? I couldn't turn pages fast enough, and then I dived straight into the second book, to find out more. The other mystery, about the disappearance of a young woman years ago, was interesting, too, but took a disquieting turn toward the end that I found overly sensationalized.One last note: This book is not for anyone squeamish about violence towards women. I do NOT want to see the movie they recently made based on it, I had enough trouble reading certain sections, I don't want to see them depicted on screen.

At one point, he even describes the main character, Lisbeth Salander, assembling a bed from Ikea, incorporating the exact Ikea instructions, point by point, in his book.Another example that comes to mind: a mysterious person travels by train from north Sweden to Stockholm. Once in his hotel room, the author describes the stranger laying out his neck ties on his bed and describes them in detail. He also gives an account of what's in the room's mini-bar. A basic guideline for modern fiction writing: try to include facts that tell you something useful or interesting about a major character and/or that moves the plot forward. Train ride good. Irrelevant details about the hotel room, bad.....delete.As an author, I wondered what happened to the editing process. I finally tracked down an essay by his Swedish editor. (I'm afraid I don't have a link for it). She explained that the author wrote the entire trilogy before submitting any of it to her. She had not seen any of his writing before that, except for his political magazine, which is very different than fiction writing. Once submitted, the editor immediately saw numerous problems. But the author resisted any editing. (Not unusual for first time authors). Very soon after, Larsson, encountering an out of order elevator in his office building in Stockholm, decided to climb several levels of stairs which triggered a fatal heart attack. (The journalist character in the books, Mikael Blomkvist, is based on the author, including his horrible health habits). The editor decided to honor Larsson's \"wishes\" and not edit the books. Personally, I find this puzzling, as there are many obvious fixes that could only improve the books without undermining what Larsson was trying to do.So why such large sales of badly-written books?

What I do remember is the peculiar experience of reading it. I read it on two flights, and on both, flight attendants tapped me on the shoulder to say \"Isn't it great?! I'm on the third one now.\" It was a very odd experience, as people rarely seem to acknowledge what I'm reading. I don't think I've read a book that was this much in the zeitgeist in years. It was the closest I've come to a mass experience involving a book. So that was interesting.As for the book itself, it was...okay. I really enjoyed the early Lisbeth Salander sections. She's such a great Tarantino-esque female character (even as she later falls into the dreadful male fantasy aspects of the novel). Once she was more actively integrated into the story, the book really took off. As many people have noted, the beginning of the book was interminable, and the end was also surprisingly drawn out. It was like one of those movies that ends five times. But in between, I have to admit, it was a page-turner. Supremely creepy and very well-plotted. Was there too much coffee drinking? Yes. Was sex for Blomqvist always bizarrely consequence-free? Yes. Was the book still enjoyable? Yes. Am I dying to read the next installment? No. I can't entirely say why, but it wasn't the kind of reading experience that left me hungry for the next book in the series.

It is she who gets all the pieces to move and finally makes the breakthrough to find out just what happened to Harriet Vanger all those years ago.I can't say anything more without revealing important details. Just know that the book has many small, interconnecting plot lines, very complex and flawed character, complicated romances, and a great mystery. I can say no more without spoiling you.In the end, I only wish that the book would have kept its original title when it got translated into English.

The millennium has nothing to do with it, in the sense that Millennium is the name of the magazine specialized in journalistic investigations with a social and economic background, above all major scandals, involving well-known personalities. The protagonist, or rather, the co-protagonist, is the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Mikael Blomkvist; the other co-protagonist is Lisbeth Salander, an unconventional girl who in transverse ways is in the position of knowing and helping Mikael. In this first investigation, Mikael, who is back from a libel trial in which he was convicted, accepts a somewhat anomalous assignment compared to his journalistic activity, that is, to try to solve an unsolved case of 30 years before. The client is a very wealthy old man who, before his life ends, decides to try everything possible to find out what happened to his favorite granddaughter many years before. This is where Lisbeth comes into play, almost by chance, with her computer skills and competences, to help Mikael to arrive at the truly unexpected discovery that will conclude the investigation. I love Scandinavian writers and knowing that Stieg Larsson will never write any more books hurts me. His writing is ideal for this type of story, a bit technological, a bit sociological and very thrilling: dark, full of expectations, with sudden twists and turns, interspersed with pieces of daily life suddenly interrupted by unexpected events.

There's actually a pretty good mystery here, but it's buried under layers of tedious exposition, unnecessary description, and especially Stieg Larsson's transparent Mary Sue-ism. For those who aren't familiar with the term, a \"Mary Sue\" is a derogatory term in fan fiction for a character that is just a little too good to be true, and who is clearly an avatar of the writer. A Mary Sue character's painfully obvious purpose is fantasy fulfillment for said writer. In this case, the late Stieg Larsson, a middle aged Swedish magazine writer, has penned a novel about...a middle-aged Swedish magazine writer. Every woman in the book, including the title character, wants to sleep with him, because he's such a nice, mellow, undemanding guy. He solves a mystery that no one else could. After he solves the mystery, he spends a completely unnecessary 100+ more pages getting his revenge against people who were mean to him at the beginning of the book. And so on.
