Although most of her books deal with both the professional world and relationships, she has managed to make every story unique and immensely entertaining. Although I didn't enjoy this novel quite as much as I've Got Your Number, it still immediately sucked me in and wouldn't let me stop reading until I finished. I think if I hadn't read this right after IGYN (my favorite book by her), I would have given it a full 5/5 stars, but blame Sophie Kinsella for making her books like candy. I can't just read ONE and call it a day. As for the story, I loved how the main character, Samantha, was the high-powered career woman in the relationship instead of the man, which is seen in most of her other stories (although she does leave the job, but still). Also, Nathaniel was a total hunky dreamboat and I would like one for my own, please and thank you. All in all, I highly recommend it, just like all of her other novels.", "num_likes": 180, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "33722.The_Undomestic_Goddess", "book_id": "33722", "book_title": "The Undomestic Goddess", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/76026561", "review_id": "76026561", "date": "Oct 28, 2009", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Laura", "user_url": "/user/show/1040930-laura", "text": "As you\u2019d expect, the story is a sitcom come to life: a work-obsessed attorney loses her job in a dramatic way and then plunges alone into the countryside \u00e0 la Jane Eyre, only to wind up being taken in as a housekeeper by some nouveau riche couple. The twist is. . . get ready. . . she doesn\u2019t know how to cook! Or run a washing machine! You can imagine the hilarity. In fact, you have to imagine the hilarity, because there isn\u2019t much written for you. That\u2019s not to say the book isn\u2019t entertaining. It moves quickly, and it ends up validating the effort and skill involved in keeping house, which I liked. Plus I found the nouveau riche couple to be oddly engaging. (\u201cOddly\u201d because they reminded me of Southern caricatures written by someone who didn\u2019t know any actual Southerners and just created people out of stereotypes \u2014 like a hick couple who hits it big in the tire business and moves into a mansion but doesn\u2019t know to lose the big hair and get grammar. Of course the characters in this book are English, as is the author, which goes to show that mediocrity knows no nationality.) The big flaw is that even though this kind of book is bound to be contrived, it still needs to retain some believability. I can buy stumbling onto the one house that would take in a stranger (we buy it in Jane Eyre), finding skulduggery at work, true love next door, and a host of other improbabilities because at least they\u2019re possible. But our heroine, in disgrace at her law firm, googles herself and finds a million entries about how she\u2019s become a national lawyer joke; at one point the tabloid press even starts following her \u201cstory\u201d! The problem is that, in reality, lawyers show up on our radar only if we\u2019ve hired them. A criminal defense attorney may have his day in the sun with a celebrity client, but other than that, who cares? Quick \u2014 name a contract attorney! Anyone?? How about any kind of attorney you don\u2019t know personally? The fact is that nobody cares if a lawyer loses her firm a lot of money and then becomes a housekeeper; the whole public ignominy angle is too manufactured even for chick lit. It reminded me of Shopaholic, where a would-be fashion writer somehow becomes a national figure and then a national scandal. How??? It\u2019s as though Sophie Kinsella is projecting some deep desire to be in the center of the public stage, holding the nation\u2019s microphone tearfully in hand. (Actually, I wouldn\u2019t mind that either, but only to rail on the government power grab and people who talk during movies.) I wonder if her \u201cOh no! The world is watching me during my moment of crisis!\u201d fantasy was brought on by too much reality TV, or . . . more likely. . . if reality TV exists precisely because so many people do have this desire for public display? Chilling thought.At any rate, that\u2019s probably not enough to condemn the book. It has its moments. And I think if it had been written differently I would have had patience for the more unrealistic aspects. However, the style was so aggressively breezy that it became wearisome. The author should have put more effort into creating a story that holds together and less time trying so desperately to be witty.Mercy \u2014 three paragraphs on a Costco paperback!", "num_likes": 114, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["best-seller"]}, {"book_id_title": "33722.The_Undomestic_Goddess", "book_id": "33722", "book_title": "The Undomestic Goddess", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/217861118", "review_id": "217861118", "date": "Oct 01, 2011", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Sita", "user_url": "/user/show/5831199-sita", "text": "4.25This was the first Sophie Kinsella book I ever read and it will remain my favourite.

But Sophie Kinsella skillfully made it seem plausible. The story of a stressed-out lawyer, stripped of her job and accidentally ending up in the unlikely position of a housekeeper for a nouveau riche couple at a country estate, was very entertaining. In \u201cThe Undomestic Goddess\u201d, Kinsella obviously spent some quality time studying not only international finance, but corporate law and commercial cooking as well . I also bet that she looked into some really excellent scams, and spent a bit of time with some professional housekeepers. Few professors could have made the subject understandable much less as engrossing and enjoyable as Ms. Kinsella has. Samantha, a whiz kid corporate lawyer -- when faced with making coffee, toast and eggs Benedict -- is totally flummoxed. Poor girl! I giggled at her sallies into the laundry room, baking catastrophes, bed making disasters.... the situation is glorious! I just love it when the know-it-all gets her comeuppance. It can only make for a hilarious tale as she embarks on her new journey that leads to love, self-discovery, and peace.The first half was fairly obnoxious. I don't really know why I kept reading, but I'm glad I did. The second half, once Samantha began to get a little bit of control in her life, became quite enjoyable. Of course, when your weekends and evenings are suddenly free, romance can\u2019t be far behind. In \"Northanger Abbey\", Jane Austen quoted Samuel Richardson\u2019s straight forward romancing rule: \"It must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her.\" Samantha, of course in true Catherine Morland fashion, fails to follows Austen's very sensible advice much to the benefit of the story. Kinsella seems to imply that just being a woman is a pretty good deal, and being a woman who has attracted the love of a decent man is really a great deal! The story could be a bit extreme, and there is little reality to how this could happen. But I don\u2019t really care! The characters are rich and warm, and I want to meet them in real life.

She builds up the character development and story so, so well, only to have it all end just shy of the perfect HEA. The first thought I usually have after finishing her books is, \"Wait, what? That's it?\" More than in Kinsella's other novels, this factor is impossible to ignore in The Undomestic Goddess. Samantha comes a long way from being a lawyer-zombie to a content housekeeper, but that change isn't really explored as much as I would have expected. It's like as soon as SK decided she'd placed her characters exactly where she wanted, she lost all interest in finishing their story properly.In addition, Nathaniel should have played a bigger role in the book. Honestly, I felt a little cheated by the \"romance\". All the hints are there, but most of the scenes between the two MCs are simply skimmed over and told in retrospect.

The story was even more far-fetched and the main character even more daft than the other Kinsella heroines combined. The heroine (Samantha) was meant to be an Oxbridge educated lawyer with years of experience in the best law firm in the country, yet somehow she read more like a grade A idiot. I don't know why authors bother giving their main characters high IQ's and super smart careers when they can only portray them as complete thickos who can barely string a sentence together. -Really liked Trish and Eddie Geiger, they were such fun characters. I loved the way they bossed Samantha about and how they interacted with each other, they were pretty hilarious. I also quite liked Nathaniel, he was a normal, down to earth sort of guy instead of the usual rich, brooding, millionaire love interest.-How on earth do you accidentally become a housekeeper? Samantha lost her job at her law firm and took a random train to the middle of nowhere, she then knocked on a random house and acted weird and somehow that magically landed her a housekeeper job in a fancy mansion with a millionaire couple. Yea, right. She also got to stay in said mansion overnight after a two minute interview in which she acted like a nutter. Yea, because that seems likely.-Why would Samantha run away from her job? Sure, she thought she made a huge mistake costing her firm fifty million quid, but she was supposed to be a highly trained professional with years of education and training, and who worked well under high pressure and was ultra responsible and had a brilliant mind and work ethic. Yet she ran away like some sort of scared naive wet behind the ears idiot. Why would someone so hard working and responsible just ditch everything at the first sign of trouble? Why wouldn't she question everything? Why wouldn't she stay to investigate and defend herself? She worked all her life to be a top tier lawyer so why wouldn't she stay and fight for her career and reputation? It was all so nonsensical.-For a high flying lawyer Samantha sure was an idiot and a half. She couldn't follow basic recipes and cooking instructions without turning the kitchen into a bloody war zone. She even struggled with slicing bread and was unable to make a jam sandwich and hard boiled eggs (the silly cow put them in the microwave?!). She didn't even know how to iron without burning everything or wipe surfaces without making things worse. It was beyond ridiculous. Yes, not everyone knows how to cook well or do certain chores, but who the hell can't boil an egg or make a jam sandwich or wipe a surface?! I'm guessing Samantha's incompetence was meant to be funny or cute or something, but it was none of those things, it was plain stupid.-How was it Samantha was so unable to hold simple conversations? A top shot lawyer should at the very least be able to hold moderately intelligent conversations. Yet half the time Samantha just stuttered and mumbled and muttered her way through things. Also, when she found out she'd been set up at work and came across suspicious evidence that pointed to another colleague (Arnold) committing fraud, the silly cow couldn't confront him or make a convincing argument against him without looking like a demented psycho dumbo loser. She was meant to be a genius lawyer who regularly talked her way through all sorts of tricky situations and dealings yet when she confronted Arnold all she was capable of doing was stomping her feet and pouting, she did nothing to defend her reputation, she just talked rubbish. It didn't even occur to her to bring up the fact that Arnold had strong family connections to the company that took that 50 million. Ugh, she was the most unconvincing lawyer character in the fictional world ever. -Why was Samantha always yelling or mumbling or pouting? Would an experienced, professional lawyer really talk like that? I swear Samantha came across more like a belligerent child than anything else.-According to The Undomestic Goddess women can't have a glittering career and a fulfilling personal life at the same time. It's either one or the other. -So Samantha gave up her career and a chance of a lifetime to be a partner in a top law firm all so she could run off to Cornwall with a guy she'd known for a few months? I mean, she only worked her whole bloody life to achieve that level of success, it was her one ambition and dream but all that got thrown out the window because she was in lurve, and working as a lawyer was just too gosh darn difficult for her tiny woman brain. Ugh.If it hadn't been for the secondary characters, I don't think I would have been able to finish this. Even for a chick lit book, it was beyond ridiculous.

Sam leaves her job after making a huge mistake that costs her firm millions of dollars. She has put her whole life into this job, trying to become partner, and now it's over. She has a major meltdown, and ends up miles from home in the middle of nowhere working as a maid to a family that doesn't know anything about her true identity. She also doesn't know anything at all about being a maid as you can probably guess by the title. This makes for an interesting hilarious ride. At one point she has no idea how to use an iron and tells her boss that she can't figure it out because she's \"far more used to working with a Nimbus 2000\" These little comments pop up everywhere making the book fly by and making you really root for this poor girl who hasn't got a clue. A bit predictable, but I don't read her books thinking I'm going to be digging into a literary masterpiece. The romance was cute, but there really wasn't much of it. Nothing but fun and laughter all the way through. Sam was an extremely fun character to read about. She's funny, smart, and can really think quick on her feet. She shows genuine signs of maturity and growth throughout this quick read.I really liked how the ultimate message was delivered, though. In the end Sam has to take a look at her life and really figure out what is important, and what isn't. Perhaps you are putting too much effort into something that gives nothing back. This was my first book from Sophie Kinsella, but I will definitely read more of her books. Her humor is fresh, and if you go into this book solely expecting a light-hearted, fun read I think you will enjoy it.Recommended to all of Sohpie Kinsella's fans, and all chick-lit lovers.

Working every day of the week for seven years trying to make partner Samantha strives for perfection.One day though just as she is about to be named a partner in the firm Samantha comes across a paper on her desk that did not get filed in time costing a client 50 million. Samantha doesn't make mistakes but this time she did and she doesn't know how to face the consequences.Needing time to think Samantha jumps on the nearest train and heads away from the fallout that is sure to come from her costly error. Not knowing where she's ended up Samantha knocks on the nearest door and finds herself mistaken for someone applying for the job as housekeeper. Instead of correcting the mistake Samantha stays on until she hears word from her job.I have to admit the believability factor on this one is pretty low with a high powered attorney ending up cooking and cleaning but that's also what makes it so much fun. Very much a comedy of errors from the one mistake it snowballs into so much more that you can't help but chuckle and laugh along. The story then becomes a romance and looks at just what could/should or would make someone happy.

We, readers, often read to escape reality, to go through an entertaining adventure to shake off the daily stress we're put through. So I truly (and that's my own opinion) don't mind it being predictable or even unrealistic at times. I could even relate to it (and to Samantha) in many ways, especially when speaking of the daily pressure of work and how you have to be constantly at disposal, having no private life and no time for yourself. I could also relate to abandoning something you've always dreamed of just for the sake of your peace of mind. Yes, peace of mind is priceless!!Anyway, this is a perfect beach read.

But I have heard some good things about her and also didn't mind the couple books that I've already read. And The Undomestic Goddess didn't do much for me. Samantha Sweeting, London's hot-shot lawyer, with busy lifestyle, very hardworking and expected to be the youngest to make partner in her firm. Everything is looking great as she's getting what she's worked for all her adult life including some teen years. Just then she's made the biggest mistake of her career and runs away from London and her career rather than facing all her colleagues, employers and ends up in the countryside (I love the countryside) and is mistaken as a housekeeper. Since she's always had her domestic chores done for her, therefore she doesn't have a clue how to do any domestic chores, let alone do what is required of her as a housekeeper. It started out great and funny even though there were some parts where I was thinking, what the heck? She's a lawyer and she doesn't know how to operate a washing machine. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that simple a thing. Apparently it does. But fine, whatever.I still kept on enjoying this thinking it's okay these things are supposed to be funny and cute (not to me) but overall it's funny but when she says no to her career which she's worked for all her life just to keep working as a housekeeper, it all went downhill for me. I just didn't want to read anymore but kept on reading thinking may be she'll somehow have it all and my predictions will not be right. Nope, didn't happen. She just throws away her career and chooses love which is amazing but can't we career women have it all? Why is it always depicted in the books for us to make a choice between this and that? I mean this is very annoying. I'm so furious at the ending that I couldn't even enjoy Samantha getting her love life back. Not to mention all that tug and pull play at the end, which annoyed me further. It was going to be a 4 stars read for me until she throws away all her life's hard work, it's 2 stars from me now.2 stars", "num_likes": 20, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["romance", "fiction", "contemporary", "chick-lit"]}, {"book_id_title": "33722.The_Undomestic_Goddess", "book_id": "33722", "book_title": "The Undomestic Goddess", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1397536926", "review_id": "1397536926", "date": "Sep 21, 2015", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Sky", "user_url": "/user/show/32831460-sky", "text": "True rating: 3.5 starsSo lately, every book I pick up feels too heavy and serious and I just want a light-hearted laugh.

Samantha is a workaholic, a perfectionist, so used to never making mistakes that when she does she takes the first train she sees without caring where it\u2019s heading, and ends up as a domestic worker. And from there the story unravels. This is the type of book you\u2019d throw a blind eye at all the flaws just for the sheer pleasure of reading it.

I find this novel to be timely for many current women who are expected to know how to conduct many domestic duties without being taught by anyone. I know that I am hopeless at many of them myself, such as sewing on a button. To be fair, I know my grandmother and mother taught me when I was young, but I honestly would rather have someone else do it for me at this point.

I needed a flight of fancy after reading a number of more sombre books, one which could carry me along with the vaguest of attention yet still be enjoyable. Somehow I'd missed this cute little tale of the high powered London lawyer who makes a first error in her stellar career, which results in the devastation of her reputation and losing her esteemed place in a top ranking firm. In a daze, Arden hops on public transit only to become lost in a bucolic village and impulsively asks a resident for a glass of water and aspirin. Of course, this is the moment that the Shakespearian ploy of mistaken identity begins to cast it's delightful spell. After accepting the strong headache pills from the house owner Trish, Arden cavalierly interviews for the position of housekeeper which she didn't know about and would never have considered but for her terrible day. She impresses her probable clients with fabrications of Cordon Bleu cooking, expertise on management and cleaning a house, doing laundry and even ironing- none of which she knows anything about. The escapades which follow are great fun, lawyer life comes back to haunt her and the story finishes on a satisfying and very upbeat note.

An easy read, this comical story had me laughing out loud along the way finishing with a satisfying happy and romantic ending for all. I would recommend this as one you pack in your suitcase: not only is it set in the summer but the satisfying ending is perfect for reading by the pool.Samantha Sweeting is a workaholic and in the opening chapters readers witness how obsessed she is with her career and aspirations of becoming a partner in the successful law firm she works in. Her inability to switch off during a reluctant pamper session had me cracking up and I found Kinsella\u2019s descriptions familiar from my own observations of typical city workers. The narrow-mindedness towards life meant that Samantha just couldn\u2019t recognise she was giving up so much for a goal that would not be the reward she really wanted.So when she begins as a housekeeper in a small village in the country where nobody recognises her, I found myself waiting for the penny to drop with her employers. But the Geigers aren\u2019t quite clued up and Samantha manages to blag her way into becoming their housekeeper, even though she has no idea how to cook, clean or do anything domesticated.The Geigers are such comical characters and Samantha\u2019s observations really make you chuckle. For example, when Eddie is reading through a suspect contract, Samantha is desperate to tell him he is making a mistake but at the same time she fears showing she is more than just a housekeeper. The lengths she goes to are entertaining but at the same time I found myself wishing she would reveal her identity and get the recognition she deserves.As Samantha adjusts to her new life (which allows time off from work \u2013 quite a novelty for her!), she finds herself becoming attracted to the Giegers gardner, Nathaniel. This romance is charming and sweet and you know that this is where Samantha should be. But when she discovers he has a hatred of lawyers, you are left wondering what will happen when he learns the truth about Samantha?This is a great read and entertaining every step of the way. One you can easily dip in and out of, I found myself liking Samantha more and more, and found I could relate to her in so many ways!

This novel follows Sophie Kinsella's typical format, although this protagonist is much smarter than any of her other lead characters. This book follows a character named Samantha, who is a hot shot lawyer for one of the most prestigious law firms in London. She works from morning until night seven days a week and doesn't ever spend any time for herself and never cooks herself any meals. She has a housekeeper because she definitely doesn't have time for mundane activities such as hoovering, as she can earn up to \u00a3500 an hour, so why on earth would she waste time cleaning? Samantha doesn't ever bother to clean her desk at work either, it is organised mess that she thrives from. She wants nothing more from life than to achieve a partnership at the firm and to potentially end up in a relationship with a colleague named Guy. Then one day, her messy desk comes back to bite her from behind and leads to her making a massive career error. Unable to face the consequences of her actions, she runs away and ends up at a house and accepting a housekeeper position without even fully realising what she is doing. From there we follow Samantha as she struggles with her new life.This book sent me on a rollercoaster of emotions, I laughed out loud, I cried several tears and I can honestly say I felt the stress Samantha was under. I feel this is some of Sophie Kinsella's best writing, and at this point I have read most of her work.I loved the vast amount of characters in this book, especially Nathaniel, who is the gardener at the house she runs away to. It was a joy seeing characters interact and watching various different relationships be built. I particularly enjoyed the role that Nathaniel's mum played, as she essentially became the mother figure to Samantha that her own mum had never been.There are just so many messages hidden between the lines of this seemingly lighthearted contemporary romance. This is so much more than just some entertainment, you learn that life is what you make of it, and how working yourself into the ground isn't always what you need. Money really isn't everything, and meanwhile no one is too smart to do a specific job. In this day and age, people find it so easy to look down on someone just because their job isn't some high flying career. Samantha is an example that sometimes you need to follow your heart, not your bank account.I absolutely adored this novel, and it would be amazing if there could be some sort of sequel one day. If you have enjoyed Sophie's other novels then you will definitely enjoy this one, meanwhile if you have never picked up a book by her before, this is a great place to start.

All of her Shopaholic books are great as well as her stand-alone novels. I wasn\u2019t planning to re-read The Undomestic Goddess but I read the first page and found it so funny I decided to carry on reading.It tells the story of Samantha Sweeting, a lawyer about to make partner at her firm, Carter Spink. One day, whilst tidying up her desk she realises she\u2019s made a huge, career-altering mistake and panics. She leaves the office, finds herself in Paddington Station, takes a train and finds herself in the middle of nowhere.

She takes the job but there\u2019s only one problem \u2013 Samantha is no Domestic Goddess\u2026This is the second time I\u2019ve read The Undomestic Goddess and I found it just as funny the second time around as I did the first. That\u2019s the one thing you can count on with Sophie\u2019s novels \u2013 they\u2019re going to be amusing.It\u2019s told in the first person so we get to know all of Samantha\u2019s thoughts and at the beginning of the novel you can feel how fast-paced her life is and you find yourself reading quicker. The first-person view also allows you to see how Samantha\u2019s life changes and slows down when she meets the Geigers.I liked Samantha and I loved that she was so dedicated to her job, she had no idea how to work a toaster or the washing machine. It shows that just because someone has an IQ of 158 it doesn\u2019t mean they can work simple appliances! Reading about Samantha\u2019s struggles during the first few days of her job was hilarious and I could see all of the situations she got herself into. I also like how salvation came and Nathaniel\u2019s mother showed Samantha that she could bake a cake and iron clothes. And that, when she puts her mind to it, Samantha could do whatever she liked.I thought Nathaniel was well written and loved how amusing he found Samantha. I thought they got on well together. I found the Geigers amusing \u2013 all the demands they ask of Samantha and how impressed they were that she was English. They were completely bonkers but I loved them anyway! As I mentioned, Nathaniel\u2019s mother, Iris, helped Samantha with her cooking skills and domestic skills. I loved the scenes between Samantha and Iris, they were sweet.One of my favourite parts of the story \u2013 and of any story \u2013 was when Samantha pulled herself together over her error that cost her her job. I love when any heroine of any story goes out to find out the truth and realises, actually, there might be more to it than meets the eye. I loved how Samantha defended herself and tried to explain herself and, in the end, was given a chance to exonerate herself.The Undomestic Goddess is definitely a favourite of mine. The story wasn\u2019t really about Samantha\u2019s job but the chance in Samantha as the novel wore on and I felt Sophie Kinsella wrote that brilliantly and realistically.

This one did not fail to disappoint and is high up on my list of favourites.It's based around work life balance. Samatha a high flying loyal has a brilliant job or does she? After believing she's screwed up and no one believes otherwise she runs for the first train out of London. She becomes quite the opposite of her old life. In her new life she's much calmer, happier, healthier and has a life. When the two worlds collide I was desperate that she didn't go backwards to the old life. I agree with her going back to clear her name though. Clear your name and leave Samantha. Then whatever you do don't lose Nathaniel. It was hilarious when in the pub it mentiones him not liking lawyers. He's still ten of the other guy in Samantha's life. Slimy Guy who only wants to know her when she's considered successful. I love how Samantha discovers it's not what you do and how it looks good. Its how it makes you feel. A lawyer, a housemaid, anything that makes her happy not miserable. It's a good motto to have.The ending happened a little quickly but at least Samantha didn't get backwards she is going forwards as a much happier person. Fantastic read from start to finish.

They are supposed to be funny but sound rather dumb and silly instead. Samantha Sweeting (29) is a bright, nervy, intelligent lawyer and she\u2019s about to be made partner of her law firm. Until she discovers she has made a mistake. A huge mistake that can wreck her career. She freaks out, run off and gets herself hired as a houskeeper. The problem is that she has no idea how to boil eggs or use the washing machine \u2013 all she has ever cared about is her work, work and more work. But rest assured nothing is too difficult for Samantha. Soon she learns how to cook, clean and iron shirts. But what if Samantha\u2019s old life catch up with her? And when it does\u2026will she want it back?Okay, its understandable that when your life is planned by the minute, one day you will get tired of it and may want to enjoy your life at slower pace. But I hated the way this story was written. I was told things but actions didn't confirm it. Simply telling that Samantha is a brilliant lawyer is not enough to make it believable. At the first problem our \"smart\" heroine run away and fail to deal with her problems. She lie, lie and lie. How on earth could she be a top lawyer and also be such an airhead and failure? If you want to write about an intelligent female protagonist, then make her smart and astute! Samantha's actions sounded silly and stupid. She's a top legal mind but she never thinks to work out some sort of suitable arrangement? I truly hate when female author write a story which show that women can not stand the pressure and demands of large scale jobs. That is always big no-no-no because it send out wrong message by implying that women can not handle stress and pressure!!

Though she doesn't have time to cook, clean, or have a relationship, she's finally ready to get the brass ring. However, a mistake she makes causes her life to go sideways and Samantha goes into hiding as a housekeeper. Problem is Samantha has no idea how to do anything domestic. I laughed a lot. Samantha hit me in my feels a bit. She has a best friend, but rarely sees her. Her mother and one brother is a workaholic and her other brother is still suffering from a breakdown. You wonder really if Samantha ever wanted to be a lawyer, or that's what her mother had planned for her. When Samantha goes into hiding, she starts to find herself and takes pride into learning the domestic arts.

At some teeny-tiny bits it was funny too. Also, far fetched books are pretty much okay for me, cuz well, it's fiction, but this one...lol, it was ridiculously unrealistic and preposterous.Too absurd. But still, I liked reading it.It's certainly not the best work of the author.

I thought the MC Samantha was fairly well developed. But there were times that I found her actions quite unbelievable and irritating. I did enjoy the overall precise of the book about following your dreams and finding a balance to life. However, sometimes I felt that so much of the story was centered around Samantha getting used to her new job and letting go of her past that the romance which was crucial to the plot got overlooked. I felt Nathaniel 's character was completely sidelined and the lack of interactions between the characters left their relationship to come across as very wanting and unsatisfactory. I also felt throughout reading the book that some of the MC's decisions were very selfish when it came to someone she claimed to care about so deeply. It is a wonder the book ended the way it did honestly.Overall, I would recommend this story if you are looking for a quick summer read.", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["chick-lit", "romance"]}]
