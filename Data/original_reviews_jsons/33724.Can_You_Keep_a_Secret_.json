Or even what it is. \" and honest to god, i just grinned like an idiot. i had to read it. i actually went to a nearby cafe right after buying this from the store just so that i could begin.which turned out to be a bad idea cos it was literally difficult to keep a straight face once i read the first few chapters.you ever had that experience when something is really really funny but you can't laugh outright or even smile cos people around you will start getting wary? this book is deadly. you have to read it on some secluded (preferably enclosed [okay make it enclosed and sound-proof]) place so you can laugh without being hampered.this book may even be funnier than her shopaholic series. there's just something so natural and so human about the insecurities and then the delusions of Emma. and though this might be a comic story first, this was a very cheeky romantic romp for me. and is it just me or was Jack sexy?? i just wanted to skip on the next scene where he'll appear--i can't wait what next secret he'll be dangling for Emma to squirm over.it's not even your run-of-the-mill chick-lit cos there were some parts that became serious they were heartbreaking. all in all, this is a highly recommended, feel good story. you'll never want to put it down (even when you know that someone soon will approach you and politely ask you to leave their premises cos you're scaring some people...)", "num_likes": 605, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["romance", "fiction-for-women", "favorites", "contemporary"]}, {"book_id_title": "33724.Can_You_Keep_a_Secret_", "book_id": "33724", "book_title": "Can You Keep a Secret?", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/274336363", "review_id": "274336363", "date": "Feb 08, 2012", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Anzu The Great Destroyer", "user_url": "/user/show/2278800-anzu-the-great-destroyer", "text": "Goal: Read a light book and laugh my ass off.Result: Read a stupid book that made me want to cut it into little pieces.Overall Goal: Happiness.Overall Result: A sh*tty headache.All my friends gave Can You Keep A Secret? a high score, all of them loved it, all of them asked me to read it.So I did.Yep.

I was determined not to allow myself to be one of \"those girls.\" You know...the ones who plan ladies night out to watch Sex and the City. I've never had a desire to read Bridget Jones' Diary or The Devil Wears Prada (although I do hate to admit that I actually liked Devil as a movie) I mean, it's Chick Lit. Fluff without the smut. What fun is that?Turns out, it's more fun than I was expecting. The book started out in such a way that I was expecting to give up before making it past a few chapters. I practically sighed with exasperation over the flighty, bumbling, office girl who embarrasses herself in front of her boss without knowing who he is. The thoughts in my head were practically burning a hole in the Nook. No, I don't care about what crappy fashion you're wearing to the office. No, I don't care that you're really a size 12 but tell people you're an 8. No, I don't care that you have a lame ass boyfriend who listens to jazz and likes bad movies.Just as I was about to hit \"delete\" and ditch the book from my ereader, something happened. I started laughing. A LOT. Not the polite little giggly \"oh that's cute\" type of laughter. The snorting, choking, oh-my-god I'm dying laughter. My husband even looked up from his zombie like trance mid-video-game to give me a wtf? look.It took several chapters for me to warm up to the book and truth be told, if I hadn't promised myself that I wanted to finish at least one chick lit book just to say that I had given the genre a shot, I would have quit out before getting to the part where it started to get good. Once I got past the mediocre parts revolving around the main character's office and family life, and got into the part where she was spending most of her time trying to figure out how to make a relationship with her boss work, I was along for the ride. It was quite the fun ride, too. I was pleasantly surprised.Will I continue to read chick lit after this? Hmmm...I don't know. This book was fun and I'm completely glad that I read it, but I still am not fond of the office girl/modern day girl formula that seems to be pretty big in this genre. Even with as funny as this book was, I've browsed some reviews for the author's books and it looks like she tends to stick with a similar subject matter for most of her books.", "num_likes": 252, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["contemporary-romance", "adult", "made-me-laugh", "chick-lit"]}, {"book_id_title": "33724.Can_You_Keep_a_Secret_", "book_id": "33724", "book_title": "Can You Keep a Secret?", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2885149646", "review_id": "2885149646", "date": "Jul 06, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "KAS", "user_url": "/user/show/20691061-kas", "text": "How hard is it to keep your deepest, darkest secrets, especially if you think you are about to die?

you ever been on a plane ride through hell and you got so scared, you thought it was better to say what you have been dying to say all your life before you crash? I feel that way every time, honestly! Although I wouldn\u2019t go into so much detail as Emma did in \u201cCan You Keep A Secret?\u201dOnce again Sophie Kinsella delivers a heroine that we want to cheer for and chastise at the same time! Emma is a lovable neurotic dreamer that I feel protective of. Spilling your deepest secrets, only to have them resurface at a very inopportune and public moment is a shame beyond measure. Yet she endures -- and triumphs. Kinsella builds these characters that we want to see succeed, although we hope they do learn a lesson or two along the way. The story is a big mouthful of pink cotton candy -- a light and fluffy romance. Fearing a plane crash, The heroine spills all her deepest secrets to a total stranger. Fortunately, their plane didn\u2019t crash. Unfortunately, the total stranger turned out to be the CEO of her company. (view spoiler)[ Worse, he manages to spill all her secrets on national television. Of course he didn't use her name, but she gave it away by her behavior.  (hide spoiler)] This is a delicious book!There were some very hilarious moments in this story. Emma is absolutely engaging \u2013 she\u2019s an adorable mess! It would be a delight to be around such a woman, although she has the morals of an alley cat. She's a \"self-made career girl\" and a future marketing executive. All in her head of course. So it's no wonder she gets herself into such tangles. She lives in her head! I think everyone knows people like this and can't help laughing at them when they get into trouble. I love the fact that she gets herself into constant binds, but good things invariably end up happening to her in the end. I think we all like a lovable loser, don't we?Not much I can say about the hero, just another closed-mouth guy, but he did come through in the end. He eventually learns that communicating with someone you are interested in is the key to trust and a lasting relationship. A couple of snarky characters, and an imbecile ex-boyfriend made for good story telling. Only wish the ending was longer. Lots of buildup and ends in a few pages, and epilogue was not informative enough. Nevertheless, I was completely hooked on this book, and was immensely entertained. This story was so funny and so far-fetched that I could actually imagine it happening to me. I will never ever spill my guts to a perfect stranger on an airplane no matter where I am going or under what circumstances.

Supposedly, this was a HI-LARIOUS rom-com, and I was in the market for exactly that.However.Sometimes what makes me smile doesn't match up with everyone else in the room...So was it funny?Yes. No. Kinda?I mean, it wasn't the sort of humor that had me doubled over, gasping for breath, but there were cute moments. It was the kind of jokey stuff that would have done well with a laugh track or something. <--if that makes sense?BUT.Even though this wasn't exactly what I was initially looking for, I still had a reallyreallyreally good time reading it! It was just a super cute romance-y little story about a young woman in the middle of getting serious about her career path, finding a man she loves, and simultaneously growing a set of balls. I've noticed that I never really find the resolutions to the assy family and/or assy friend drama in Chick-lit to me sufficiently, um...resolved, I guess? And this one was no different. The ending felt sort of rushed as everything gets kinda built up to this crazy-dramatic showdown, then everyone whistle-farts away into a Happily Ever After. <--I've come to expect that, it's not even a deal breaker anymore.There was quite a bit of the ridiculous in this as far as nonsensical plot stuff goes, but I don't read this genre to get a glimpse of realism. So, a lot of the nuttier aspects of the story, (view spoiler)[like the way her co-workers figured out he was talking about her on television (hide spoiler)], get a pass from me.If you're looking for something fluffy to get you through the week, I would say Can You Keep a Secret? is a great choice.", "num_likes": 100, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["kindle", "chick-lit", "read-in-2018", "romance"]}, {"book_id_title": "33724.Can_You_Keep_a_Secret_", "book_id": "33724", "book_title": "Can You Keep a Secret?", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1567306964", "review_id": "1567306964", "date": "Mar 02, 2016", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Beverly", "user_url": "/user/show/13095060-beverly", "text": "OMG, this book is laugh out loud funny, like sitting in my cubicle at work just giggling to myself.

This book is, hands-down, the funniest book I've ever read. I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes and cramps in my tummy throughout. This book should come with a warning label, something like, Can You Keep a Secret?... AKA The Sole Cause of Death by Laughter World-Wide! It's nearly impossible to hate a book after it makes you feel so warm and fuzzy inside.Most of this book is solid 5-star material. There's humor, romance, lesbian fantasies, drama, and good decision-making, along with some of the most outrageously hilarious characters ever to be created (yes, I mean you, Jemima). Unfortunately, the ending sorely lacks closure, and is the main reason why I didn't give this a higher rating. All my other problems mainly stem from this one issue. The ending left me entirely unsatisfied and highly doubtful about the future of Emma and Jack, as a couple and otherwise. Basically, it didn't feel like an ending. It was rushed and anti-climactic, in addition to being slightly unrealistic. It would have been the perfect ending had this been a series, but since it's a stand-alone novel, I got the distinct impression that there were still several chapters left, and they were simply missing from the version of the book I read. Not the greatest feeling to have after finishing a book, to be sure. Emma is a lot better at confrontations and standing up for herself than the other two heroines of Kinsella's I've read, namely Poppy from I've Got Your Number: A Novel and Lexi from Remember Me? I'm sure most female readers can relate to her in one aspect or the other. I really loved Jack too, until he (view spoiler)[betrayed Emma (hide spoiler)]. I never truly accepted his excuse, nor did I entirely forgive him for it. After everything that happened between Emma and Jack, especially the whole deal with their respective secrets, I would have really liked to see more of them as a couple, to genuinely believe they had anything lasting going on. These are two individuals from vastly different backgrounds, and let's face it: the man's a multimillionaire, and the girl's his employee. In real life, these kind of relationships hardly ever work out, and I would have liked Kinsella to prove me wrong by actually showing Emma and Jack in a stable relationship, one where they both learn to talk their problems out instead of jumping to conclusions. We never really get to know Jack as someone besides \"Jack Harper, the man who founded the Panther Corporation\", and the trust between Emma and him seems too delicate and fragile for anything but a temporary affair.I guess I was simply expecting more from this book, and while it was one of the best light reads I've read in a while, that annoying feeling I got, the one where I really don't feel the ending did justice to the story, sort of ruined it for me. That aside, this is truly a fantastic book, one of the rare ones I'll certainly be re-reading in the years to come. THANK YOU to everyone who urged me to read this book ASAP!

The heroine (Emma) blurted out every little detail of her life to some random guy sitting next to her just because the plane she was on was going through some turbulence. Naturally, the random guy turned out to be her sexy, bazillionaire boss who used her secrets against her the first chance he got (never mind professionalism and good work ethic). -All the female characters were men obsessed idiots, their only goal in life was getting married and having babies. Nothing else was important, career and family didn't matter, it was all about landing a man. That was the ultimate achievement.

She was seriously deluded. -Why did Emma keep saying Jack was in love with her? Not once did he tell her he loved her and there was nothing in his actions that suggested he was. They'd had two dates and one night of sex and that somehow made Emma think Jack was in love with her. What a stupid cow.-Why didn't Emma ever stick up for herself? Why are all of Kinsella's heroines such doormats? Emma was on a whole other level of doormat, she just smiled and kept her mouth shut whenever her family or someone else bitched at her. It was beyond infuriating to read the POV of someone who was so unable to stand up for themselves. -Emma's parents were such dicks, they treated her like crap and never showed her any love or support. They saved all that for their niece (Kerry), and treated her better than their own daughter. Emma was the one who needed love and emotional support, not Kerry. When her jerk parents finally realised how they'd been favouring Kerry over their only child for years, all they did was give a lame apology and act mildly remorseful. And silly cow Emma immediately accepted their apology and was over the top grateful for them finally acting like half decent parents. Yea, as fucking if. A halfhearted apology doesn't erase years of rubbish parenting, Emma's reaction was so unrealistic. In reality she would have still been hurt and bitter about how unloved she'd felt growing up, I didn't expect her to rant and rage at them but some real emotions would have been appreciated. Instead she went on like they were the best parents in the world, and magically forgot their douchey behaviour after a sentence or two of mild remorse. Yea right.-There was more passion and emotion from Jack and his dead friend than Jack/Emma. The way Jack talked about him, it was like they had an epic love affair or something. I ended up wanting to read about them instead of Jack/Emma's relationship.-Jack spilling all of Emma's secrets on TV was a dick move. And then him acting like it was unintentional was beyond ridiculous, he revealed every little thing about her and then he was all 'duh, it was an accident. I'm sowwy.' The whole thing was ridiculous, and Emma was bonkers to let him off the hook.

This was my first book by Sophie Kinsella and I decided to read it after reading the review of my dear friend KAS, so thank you. This book made me grin, a lot. And I really felt embarrassed for Emma.

A couple of days ago I was sick and in bed all day. I had just finished another book and was wondering which book to start next. I saw this on my Nook and remembered you said it's her best book. This book really made me feel better when I was under the weather.Emma is 25 and has been through many jobs. She has had a job in marketing for over a year now, and although she does okay, she's not exactly moving up the corporate ladder. She lives with her bff Lissy and has a boyfriend that she thinks is almost too cute and perfect. One day on a terrifying plane crash she turns to the man next to her and starts blabbering every random secret she has to the stranger next to her. She tells him everything including several things that could get her in trouble at work. A few days later when this stranger walks in her workplace and she's made aware that he is the founder of her company she is mortified. Can he keep her secrets?I've gotten to the point where I feel like if you have reviewed one Sophie Kinsella book you have reviewed them all. The same things always apply. Laugh out loud humor, a loveable but usually quite clueless heroine, some barely there romance, and a picture perfect ending. They also usually include a subtle message from which the character learns something important about life. The fact that you know what you're getting when you go into one of her books can be a good thing or a bad thing. For me I like it. I know what to expect and she never lets me down. Note: I have read a few of her singles, but still haven't gotten to the Shopaholic series, so don't hold me to that.My only complaint and reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the predictability. See how I said it could go both ways? I like knowing what to expect, but I would also like a bit of surprise with the ending. This one had a formula that seemed so similar to \"I've got Your Number\" in regards to the boyfriend factor. Why bother giving the heroines a boyfriend at the start of the book? We always know how that's going to end. I know Sophie Kinsella has it in her to write something more original and unique for the chick-lit genre and when she does that's when I will give her my 5 stars.Fans of Kinsella will not be disappointed with this one, and I agree with Jasprit.

Beware spoilers ahead!I have been a fan of Kinsella's since\u00a0Finding Audrey.\u00a0Naturally I went through all of her books and tried to decide which one to read.\u00a0Can You Keep a Secret?\u00a0stood out the most. I am happy to say that I loved it!Emma has gone to represent her company Panther Cooperation in a meeting. As per Kinsella books the meeting turns into a disaster whilst Emma spilling a product on one of the other company's worker. Emma goes back in a bad mood and has quite a bit to drink. The plane she is on experiences turbulence. Out of panic (and she's drunk) Emma tells all her secrets to another passenger. All's fine until Emma goes to work on Monday to find out that the passenger is the CEO of Panther Cooperation.Can You Keep a Secret?\u00a0was so funny and relatable! The writing tense is in first\u00a0person all from Emma's point of view. There are numbers for the chapters. As well as emails and notes.\u00a0I related to a lot of Emma's work woes. It's really hard to prove yourself in a workplace that doesn't appreciate you. Emma's co-workers like Artemis reminded me off some of my co-workers. There's always that one person that's just fake. On the bright side Katie was fun to read about! She was actually really sweet and a good friend to Emma.Emma lived in an apartment with two flatmates. Lissy and Jemima. Lissy has been Emma's best friend since they were 7. Lissy and Emma constantly support each other throughout Can You Keep a Secret?\u00a0There friendship was absolutely adorable! I'm a bit conflicted about Jemima. She definitely thought she was helping. But Jemima's suggestions were terrible. And didn't really make sense. I do have to give Jemima props for trying to help.Emma's family play a huge part in\u00a0Can You Keep a Secret?\u00a0Emma feels that she's disappointed her parents. Her cousin Kerry always tries (and succeeds) to one up Emma. Nev (Kerry's husband) also pokes at Emma about her career changes. Emma is able to sort everything out with her family.Prior to\u00a0Can You Keep a Secret?\u00a0Emma begins dating a co-worker named Connor. Connor works in another division at Panther Cooperation. During the plane ride Emma realizes that she doesn't really have feelings for Connor anymore. Emma is in denial about this. She breaks up with him much later on.I personally found Connor to be annoying! Emma asks Connor to keep their break-up to himself for the time being. Seeing as they work together. Instead at a party (while drunk) announces their break-up. Their office blames the whole situation on Emma as she is the one to dump him. And he doesn't even apologize! It didn't help that the co-workers didn't bother to see it from Emma' point of view.Connor also tries multiple times to confront Emma about who she is dating. He acts like a martyr and always has a way of patronizing Emma. I also found him to be totally inconsiderate. To try and look professional during a staff meeting Connor shuts down Emma's point. Just because Jack Harper was present. I honestly don't understand why Emma blamed herself for everything. Connor has a brain too. He can realize himself that not all women keep secrets.As far as Emma's secrets go I didn't find them that bad. Some of them were really dumb while the others hilarious! What was troubling is how easy it was for Emma to lie. And she did so constantly. Emma did develop and started actually admitting the truth. She even started to stand up for herself! Emma stood up to Kerry and Paul (her boss). I especially liked how she handled Paul. And in the end it paid off as she got promoted.I really liked Emma and Jack's relationship! When Jack appears in at the Panther Cooperation, he spends quite a bit of time poking fun at Emma's secrets. It was honestly so assuming! Through their relationship they grew. Jack learned to become more open. And Emma learned to stand up for herself and be honest. They made a really good couple. Also Jack's actually American.\u00a0Can You Keep a Secret?\u00a0takes place in London.I didn't have any problems. Expect for Connor but I think it was well handled.

In honor of this book\u2014and because I absolutely suck at writing reviews for books I love, I am going to spill to you, strangers of the Internet, all of my secrets. Okay, not all, but five.1. I used to be majorly obsessed with Seventeen magazine.  Back then, I begged my parents numerous times over the dinner table to buy me a subscription (all the savings!), but they always refused. In hindsight, that was probably a good thing because I soon got tired of all the high-definition pages of clothes, shoes, and make-up. The real sustenance was located in the back and only covered 4-5 pages. I'm proud to say that nowadays I blow my money on more worthy things, like badly-written YA novels that induce headaches.2. That's a biggie.3. I'm a huge fan of Taylor Swift, even though liking her is an extremely uncool thing these days. Her lyrics are prose spun into music, that's all the reason I need.4. I sometimes think The Book Thief is better than the Harry Potter series. Then I make a pro-vs-con list in my head and all is right in the world once more.5. I love Kinsella's work. A lot of people hate them and I get it. Her heroines are essentially recycled book to book. The love interest is usually American and a logical businessman compared to the scatterbrained MC. They're filled with first-world problems and limited character growth. The problems work themselves out most of the time and the MC and Mr. Businessman go home happy and schmooze.But at the same time, they're also fun, compulsively readable, and keep me up reading til 2am on a school night because I can't stop flipping the pages. They remind me that reading is indeed a hobby and something I look forward to after a long day, unlike some books I could mention *cough*The Death Cure*cough* So the next time someone asks me who my favorite authors are, I'll say: \"Stephen King, J. K Rowling, George R.R.

We went to a supermarket before going to our campsite to buy some basic stuffs.One of my friends, Jeffrey was with me.(I don't know why he keeps on tagging along with me)I know my period is just around the corner so I was looking for some tampons. Now, tell me ladies. Can you buy a tampon with a straight face if one of your very male, very virile friend is with you? Even if he is the kind of friend who I share a single lollipop without having second thoughts, I tell you, NO. Bad: the store is SO big I can't find where they put the fucking tampons and I'm having a hard time looking for it. The freaking sales ladies were not around at that times so there's no one to ask.The time came when he noticed I'm not buying anything, just strolling around. He asked me if there's something I'm looking for and I'm too embarrassed to tell him I'm looking for a you know what. I just can't tell him to leave me alone because he'll know I'm hiding something. (In his universe, the only reason I'll send him away is when I'm planning to buy chocolates and I'm not planning to give him anything.)Worse: Jeff is the type of guy who won't stop badgering you if he knows you are hiding something so I just can't send him away. I'm getting antsy because we only have a limited time in the store and I still can't find the tampons, so no other choice, I whispered:\"Quiet you, I'm looking for some tampons.\"To which he replied: OH YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A TAMPON?! WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?! LET'S LOOK FOR YOUR TAMPONS! HOW MANY TAMPONS DO YOU NEED? Did I mention that he keeps on saying-excuse me- shouting the word TAMPON? I was so mortified because a group of guys were looking at us and some high-school girls were laughing. I wanted to punch the son-of-a-gun and maybe cripple him a little but I can't because he was one of the people I love so much and no matter how embarrassing that scenario was, my fondness for him was bigger than the mortification. Same with this bloody book. It was embarrassing in a way that I was embarrassed for the heroine when she found her self in those certain situations. I died a little when the secret was out in her workplace. But no matter what, I just can't hate or put the book down because I learned to love it. I love it and it was worth it. Now, why did I keep on remembering that scene with me, Jeff and the tampon? Hell, I don't know.

However, I couldn't stand the love interest, and was disappointed she forgave him. ***Spoilers ahead***As soon as he started talking about her on TV I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, because by then it was too late to introduce another romantic interest, and Connor had already been revealed as a foil for Jack, so there was no hope that she wouldn't end up with Jack, and what he did was, to my mind, close to unforgivable. Of course, Emma is pissed off at this interview and the humiliation she suffers as a result, and that made me hopeful that at least there'll be some decent levels of grovelling to beg for her forgiveness. But when she's given the opportunity to confront him, she doesn't. She wusses out. Eventually, she just sort of complains that she doesn't know anything about him, which annoyed me because she wasn't sticking to the point and was letting him get away with major arseholery. But Jack, making sure we know he's an unchastened arsehole from start to finish, tells her that his secrets are more important than hers. AFTER AIRING ALL HER SECRETS ON TV. At that point he crossed the line firmly into irredeemable wanker. Not that he isn't obnoxious and horrible from the start. I'm not a fan of romances, where the disparity between the partners is as big as it is here. He's her boss, he's extremely wealthy, he holds all the information. She's poor, she's his employee and she knows nothing about him. It's a pretty terrible set up for a romance, if you ask me. But anyway, Jack does absolutely nothing to mitigate these circumstances.He, a super-rich man who owns the company in which Emma works, uses every opportunity to mock her for things she spilled out to him in a moment of panic when they were on a plane together and she thought they were falling to their deaths. Then he invites her out on a date, during which he ORDERS ALL OF HER FUCKING FOOD. That was cringeworthy in the extreme, and I was waiting for it to be revealed that he has some sort of social disorder, maybe he's autistic or on the autism-aspergers spectrum, which would have excuse such complete tone-deafness as to normal date behaviour. But no, there's no hint of that. He's just your ordinary, garden-variety arsehole. Then, when he won't speak to her, at their date, and she asks him if he's all right, he actually tells her to \"quit it.\" And when she wants to leave, he won't let her. He pays the bus driver to drive her to her door. Which again, is done without her consent or knowledge. Shortly after this, he meddles in her family affairs, completely without her consent, too. And then, of course the TV interview happens. So, yeah, he's pretty terrible. In fact, besides being rich and handsome and good at his job, he lacks any other admirable qualities, which makes me think that Emma must be a shallow fortune-hunter, just like Jemima. Except Jemima is at least open and up front about it. In the end, when he thinks that Emma has spoken to a journalist about him and he walks off in a huff even after she swore to him she hadn't spoken to the journalist at all, I was so furious with him I was hoping for a car crash in which he was the only victim. AFTER TELLING THE WHOLE WORLD ALL OF HER SECRETS ON LIVE TV HE DARES GET HIS KNICKERS IN A TWIST BECAUSE HE THINKS SHE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN TO A JOURNALIST?!? AND WON'T EVEN LISTEN TO HER EXPLANATION? So yeah, when they got together in the end, I felt pretty horrified.

When the meeting falls apart, that\u2019s only the beginning of her troubles. Now that she sees her chances of a promotion slipping away, she can\u2019t stop the downward spiral.

Well, it goes without saying things just keep getting more and more complicated, but in the truest form of hilarious entertainment.I absolutely adored Emma Corrigan\u2019s narration.

To some (or many), I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what this story was, and it was for me, too, for the most part, at least for the first half or so... until it wasn\u2019t. In the beginning, I was totally in and totally charmed by heroine Emma Corrigan and her predicament of blurting all her deepest (mostly silly) secrets to her plane-mate on a rocky flight \u2014 a man by the name of Jack Harper, who serendipitously turns out to be the CEO of the company Emma works for.For 200 pages or so I was enjoying myself, zipping through the pages at lightning speed. Even though I found Emma to be a bit flighty and immature as the story progressed, I was still having fun, enjoying her awkward interactions with Jack, who held promise of being a truly memorable romcom hero. Honestly, I\u2019m not really sure where it went wrong for me. Perhaps it was around the time Emma (and I) lost trust in Jack \u2014 trust that Emma gave back out to Jack after a good solid portion of the story was lost to melodrama and silliness. I guess I\u2019m just an unforgiving sort because I actually found what Jack did (view spoiler)[divulging all of Emma\u2019s secrets on television (hide spoiler)] to be reprehensible, and certainly not something I would have ever forgiven myself \u2014 hot millionaire or not!But it wasn\u2019t even Jack\u2019s folly that ruined this for me, it was the sheer craziness of Emma\u2019s behaviour, along with the outrageous actions of her roommate Jemima (a character who singlehandedly took this story from a possible 5 star read to a borderline 3 star read for me). And that\u2019s not to mention Emma\u2019s mindless family and her co-workers, the majority of whom were straight-up bullies and should have been whacked over the face with workplace harassment. Truly, the secondary cast here were just super extreme and highly unlikeable, which was a shame because I\u2019m definitely one who finds enhanced joy in my reads when the story features a great cast of support characters.So, besides the fact that I felt the last 100 pages were one big clusterf*ck of nonsense and frustration, I can still admit that I really enjoyed myself during most of the first half, to the point that, even when things turned sour for me, I still ate it all up like my life depended on it. It just bugs me something fierce when you think you\u2019re reading your new favourite romcom, but it devolves quickly into the same silly, OTT melodrama that led me away from M/F romance reading (and firmly over to M/M reading) in the first place. Le sigh. Putting my too rational, possibly a tad too cynical brain aside, I\u2019m trying my best to accept this for what it was, which was a light and amusing read \u2014 one with a fun, albeit far-fetched little set-up for an office romance, which many readers will enjoy.", "num_likes": 25, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["borrowbox", "tstl", "mf", "romance"]}, {"book_id_title": "33724.Can_You_Keep_a_Secret_", "book_id": "33724", "book_title": "Can You Keep a Secret?", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/27845768", "review_id": "27845768", "date": "Jul 21, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Serena", "user_url": "/user/show/1349220-serena", "text": "Sophie Kinsella's \"Can You Keep a Secret?\" blew me away with its wit and humor.

In some ways, the turbulent plane ride becomes a metaphor for her life throughout much of the book after meeting a fellow business executive, who turns out to be her firm's founding owner--Jack Harper.Emma spills all of her secrets to this stranger on the flight while others on the flight are praying that they will land safely in London. These secrets range from her hatred of crochet to her attempts to kill a co-worker's plant with orange juice. She thinks nothing much of it at the time because he is a mere stranger on the plane. However, she soon gets back to the office to discover that the man on the plane is none other than Jack Harper, the partial owner of Panther Corporation.The banter between Emma and Jack sets the stage for the ultimate betrayal. Emma runs the gamut of emotions in this book from pleased with herself that she and the CEO have a secret understanding to head-over-heels in love to disappointment, embarrassment, and betrayal.***End Spoiler Alert***This books examines relationships in their many forms: love, romance, friendship, family. Emma learns a lot about her familial relationships and that even the best of friends have secrets from one another. She learns that honesty may be the hardest option in some cases, but it generally is the best road to undertake. Her evolution throughout the novel is fantastic and well-paced. I enjoyed Emma's struggles, which often reflect many of the struggles other women have in balancing the many relationships we have.It begs the question, who do you trust you secrets to?

She\u2019s so busy trying to get people to like her that she lost sight of whom she was or who she can be.Bottom line: she\u2019s way too hard on herself.Honestly, at first I didn\u2019t mind that Emma was so pathetic, na\u00efve, and obnoxious, but enough was enough!She\u2019s not a woman. No. She acts, talks, and thinks like an immature and timid fucking teenager and needs to get her shit straight. She's one of the most melodramatic and boring characters I've ever encountered.There is not a single moment of peace in her life. I\u2019m dead serious. She spends the ENTIRE book either panicking, feeling mortified, or wanting to cry when something doesn\u2019t go her way.\u201cI feel like crying with disappointment. I just don\u2019t understand it. It was going so well.\u201d\u201cI almost want to cry. My beautiful flattering dress is lying in a calico bag, ready for the collection at the end of the day.\u201d\u201cSuddenly I want to burst into tears. I want to sink down on the pavement and bury my head in my hands and sob.\u201d\u201cI was so totally mortified. I never told anyone. Especially not Mum and Dad.\u201d\"I have never felt so mortified in my entire life. Ever.\"\"I can barely talk. I am beyond embarrassment. I just want to disappear into the rug and never be seen again.\"\"Every time anyone walks into the department I feel a little spasm of panic.\"\"A wave of panic overcomes me.\"\"I look up and down the street, trying not to panic.\"\"Outwardly, I\u2019m still quite calm.

There's nowhere to hide! Without thinking twice I almost run to the glass doors, push them open, and hurry out of the building. I scuttle down the steps, run about a hundred yards down the road and stop, panting. This is not going well.\"\"Without quite meaning to, I find myself running back down the steps and along the street again.\"\". . . that I\u2019m really sorry, that basically I want to die . . .\"\"I want to die.

It's the only thing I want in the whole world, and I'll work so hard, I promise, I'll come in at weekends, and I'll - I'll wear smart suits.'\u201dFucking boohoo. Go ahead and cry and beg and kick and scream and pout, Emma, because you are one fucking sore loser. You boring, insecure, shallow, clueless excuse of a woman who thinks she knows what hard work is. Your pathetic self can't evoke any sympathy from me.At first, Emma's thoughts were funny, but they got old really quick. (Not to mention: the stupid first person pretense sense.)The upside: I almost stopped at 59% but good thing I kept going to see Emma (final-fucking-ly) tell Kerry (her cousin) off. She finally did something right. Technically, it was the second reasonable action she took. The first was when she broke up with Connor. All outsiders ever said about this couple was \u201cYou two seemed so perfect.\u201dNot \u201cYou two seemed so happy.\u201dBut \u201cperfect.\u201dConnor is stupid.Emma is stupid.Everybody in this book is stupid and I don\u2019t have the energy to rampage their characters.Another thing! After Emma was \u201cbetrayed\u201d on TV, she forgets the lesson (the one she was taught mere hours earlier) about not revealing her secrets and inner thoughts to strangers because what does she do?She goes on crying in the streets and blabbers her feelings to some guy she hardly knows!Yeah, way to go, Emma. You don't fucking make a lick of sense.And you pick your friends so well. Not. Your flatmate is a man-eater.The only thing I can appreciate about Emma's character is she starts to be more honest with her colleagues, friends, and family. That's about it.Oh, and Jack, don't think I forgot about you.Go to your room and stay there.Can You Keep a Secret? is one of the worst chick lit I\u2019ve ever read.

For example, I really enjoyed THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS, REMEMBER ME? and TWENTIES GIRL (in that order). The first Shopaholic book was okay, but the second made me very angry, because in it, the main character quickly devolved back into her own habits, neatly erasing any character development that occurred in the first book, and making me wonder, \"Why am I supposed to give a f*ck, again?\"CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? is about Emma Corrigan, a girl with lots of \"secrets.\" Secrets is in quotes, because most of her secrets are actually lies. Here are a few samples of Emma's secrets: Emma steals her roommate's expensive designer clothes & then lies about it. Emma tells her work friend that she loves the crochet she makes for her, when in actuality she hates them & throws them away (bitch). Emma wears a size four thong that is super uncomfortable because she lied to her boyfriend about her weight. And so on, and so forth.One day, she gets on a plane that goes through some severe turbulence. Thinking she's about to die, she confesses all of her \"secrets\" to her seatmate. Spoiler alert: the plane doesn't crash, and Emma lives to lie another day. She thinks this embarrassing but seemingly harmless incident is behind her, until she sees her seatmate/confessor again...and realizes that he is the man who owns the company where she works. In other words, he's her boss's boss's boss, Jack Harper.I actually really liked Jack. I thought it was hilarious, how he tortured Emma about her secrets. I laughed out loud at some of these passages. Later on the book, he does something that is, admittedly, rather insensitive, but since I had already decided that I didn't like Emma, it didn't bother me - especially since it triggered another chain of hilarity (at Emma's expense, even better). I also loved Emma's roommate, Jemima (the one Emma steals clothes from). I think I was supposed to dislike her, but dear lord, she was funny, and so much more interesting than Emma. And her \"Mummy\"! I loved Jemima's Mummy's advice about men - she is so deliciously evil. It kind of bothered me how casual Emma and Lissy were about breaking into Jemima's room and stealing her stuff, even though she told them not to; I wouldn't want anyone using my things, either. And since this was an act of stealth, they obviously weren't washing them after! Gross and a total invasion of privacy.That's actually the meat and potatoes of my dislike for this book - Emma was not a sympathetic protagonist. I could understand if she was meant to be unsympathetic or if she was the \"before\" to a redemption arc (Marian Keyes does this to great effect), but no, we're supposed to embrace and relate to Emma as the every girl. She was very whiny and self-centered and immature, and I could not relate to her, at all! I mean her reason for why she should get a promotion is \"I'll wear smart suits!\"As if the author knows how dislikable Emma is, the villains in this book are almost cartoonish caricatures of villany designed to make the protagonist seem sympathetic in comparison. Take Kerry, Emma's cousin, and family favorite, who is so oily and repulsive that you would probably see her picture under the dictionary definition of \"smug.\" Or Artemis, who is basically Jemima, without the sagacious \"mean girl\" wisdom. She's just a mean girl without the subtlety.CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? is not the worst Sophie Kinsella book I've read (SHOPAHOLIC TAKES MANHATTAN receives that honor), but it is far from being the best. The three books I mentioned in the second paragraph of this review are all much, much better.

At first, I could excuse her a couple of times because she really was being set back by her family and she did just have a lot of terrible people around her and what not. So I could comprehend it that she was scared to let them see the real her but when the story continues her behavior only gets worse I think and that\u2019s what bugging me most. Even with small things she just almost never told anyone the truth. Her first reaction to everything is her telling the exact opposite of what she thinks and it just annoyed me so much. And aside from that, I just couldn\u2019t care for most of the other characters. Most of them were so incredibly mean and fake and I know the real world can be a hard place to be but being surrounded by THAT many wrong-doing people is laying it on a bit too thick I think. The way her parents ignored her and at the end they turned around completely because of 1 thing said about Kerry, her cousin, and all is forgiven then? One of her roommates Jamima was just cringeworthy and annoyed me so much, lol. Everything that came out of her mouth was hateful and condescending and I can\u2019t believe she had quite a large part being a minor character. Lissy, on the other hand, was one of the few likable characters and she was a great friend. She and Jack were the most likable characters to me. The only reason I finished the book is because I was just curious to see if things would progress and to see how it all ended but well.. I just wasn\u2019t impressed with it all to say the least, unfortunately. The romance wasn\u2019t quite believable as well I think. I feel bad for Connor -her boyfriend at the beginning of the book- because he believed her to be this person who had a lot of the same interests as her, not knowing most of their interests are really a world apart and she\u2019s just \u2018lying\u2019 to him to make him happy of some sorts - this had been going on for years, ever since they started dating. And then the way they ended was just so sad for him I think, when she bombards him with the truth all of a sudden and he gets really insecure because of that - which I can understand when you\u2019ve been played and lied to like that. The main character was so unstable. She was running hot and cold within seconds. One moment there\u2019s an extreme outburst of truth out of the blue and the next there\u2019s a sh*tload of lies coming out of her mouth again. And then there\u2019s Jack, one of the two characters I did like. but even he couldn\u2019t seem to get things right by her. She told him about how her perfect first date would look like and he rearranges it all for her as a surprise and it was really sweet and then she\u2019s like \u2018well, why don\u2019t I get a choice in the matter of what to eat and such and I would\u2019ve liked that a whole lot more then everything you did to surprise me..\u2019Ugh, my review is all over the place, lol.

I was hysterical with laughter. I don't read many books that make me laugh quite as hard or as much as this one did. So Emma Corrigan is on her way home from a business trip when the flight gets a little rocky. She doesn't handle flying well so when the plane hits some turbulence she thinks she is going to die and ends up spilling all her secrets to the man sitting next to her. When she doesn't actually die, she eventually learns the man who knows all her dark secrets, is actual is one of the founders of the company she works for and is headed back into the company spotlight. Of course, she is totally screwed and it makes a fantastic read and hilarity ensues. I totally loved how Emma would not just shut up sometimes or how she tried to do something right but then it ended up totally wrong. I love how the relationship builds between her and Jack. How because he knows her secrets there is something easy in their building relationship. It is like he gets her even before he really knows her (if that makes any sense). The other characters are great. Lissy is a wonderful friend and Jemima is totally crazy but in a good way. There were many times when I felt embarrassed for Emma. She put herself in a horrible situation, but it became worth it in the end. I will definitely be reading more of Sophie Kinsella's books. I love being able to laugh while reading. I don't read many funny books like this one. I would recommend this to a slightly more mature audiences because there is cursing, sex, and some more adult appropriate topics mentioned. I'm still laughing as I reflect on this book. It's funny, sweet, embarrassing, and not one to miss. Overall: 5 starsRecommendation: Yes! So funny, I'm still laughing.

The characters are basically in love after a week. A WEEK. The female protagonist is sympathetic enough, though. The bits about fashion left me scratching my head - these must be some of the most oddly dressed girls in the world. Those parts really took me out of the book (stupid and shallow, I know). Another thing - weird word usage. Things like the male protagonist hit himself in the head with his fist after he said someone's name wrong. You may slap yourself on the head (open-palm-like, I mean). You may just kind of touch yourself on the forehead with your fist, but seeing that he 'hit himself in the head with his fist' just made me blink. There are lots of other examples of strange word usage like that.Also, the main male character is supposed to be American, but often uses British-isms. \"Eight nines.\" No, in America, it would have been \"eight times nine.\" Also, he says \"zowee.\" What kind of man says zowee, unless he's eight? Stupid little things like that really took me out of the book, because I pay attention to stupid little details, it seems, and am easily distracted. But still. Ugh. Basically, it was just dumb. Not charming or adorable. There were plenty of parts in there that felt so unnecessary, so frivolous, so ... unrelated to the main plot. It didn't seem like a 'tight' book, like most of the other chick-lit books I've read. Granted, I haven't read that many chick-lit books/romance books, and also, I hate calling them chick-lit because that phrase is just a way to diminish women's writing (Oh, yeah, it's *just* chicklit, or it's *just* romance, it can't sit on this shelf with all the srs bzns fiction), but the similar books I have read have been tight. I'm thinking specifically of Julia Quinn's books, which I LOVE. Every single damn one is just so tight. There's not even a frivolous sentence in there, and that's why it's so engaging: because on some level, you can just tell that every scene matters, every sentence matters, so there's no time for you to get bored and zone out while reading and start wool-gathering. This book was not at all like that. I read this as kind of a palate cleanser.

I really do. Marian Keyes is one of my favorite authors because her characters are clearly developed, her stories are engaging and relatable, and so many bits are laugh-out-loud funny. I like to be moved by what I read: moved to laugh, moved to tears, moved to think... This book will do none of those things (well, it moved me to think \"I want those hours of my life back!\")I thought \"Can You Keep a Secret?\" was one of the worst books I've ever read--it was definitely the worst piece of women's lit I've ever encountered. I was VERY close to closing the book halfway through and counting my losses--but so many people seemed to like the book I thought it might miraculously recover. No such luck. In fact, it gets worse.Our main character is an insecure loser--no wit, no charisma, and no common sense. Every sentence of hers starts with \"Err, Umm, Uhhh...\" She's bumbling in a totally un-charming way. The \"romancing\" between the two main characters consists of 2 disastrous dates, one where he is cold, controlling and pre-orders everything for her and one that lasts all of 2 minutes before he runs off with no explanation. So the next time she sees him she sleeps with him. Naturally. And we're supposed to get goosebumps when they end up together? Urgh? The ONLY reason we're given for Emma liking Jack is that she's a lowly assistant and he's the hot owner of the company and has tons o' money. True story. The way Emma treats her boyfriend is really despicable. She tells him she'll move in with him, but at her boss's provocation she breaks up with her boyfriend and goes on a date with her boss the next night! And this is after her boss spends the evening consoling the boyfriend. And the author doesn't present this as a flaw in their characters. What a joke--these people are hot messes.And Emma's relationship with her parents/cousin is so fake and ridiculous. Her parents favor the cousin--laud all praise and attention on her, and when Emma finally points it out, they're shocked, send the cousin away, and finally tell her that they love her. My, what wonderfully crafted storytelling! SNOOOOORE!!!This book was unfunny, predictable, boring, and insulting to the reader. It reads like it was written for 13-year-olds. Example: Emma crosses her fingers behind her back every time she lies. Gag. I like my chick lit to have a STORY and some WIT--for the main characters to be strongly developed. Alas, this book is none of those things. I would give it no stars if I could. And if I could write in library books, I would write on the first page: \"Halt! Close the cover!

Emma gets on your damn nerves for a lot of stuff she thinks or does. She is supposed to be this super relatable air-head, but if I\u2019d ever be able to relate to her for even one bit, I would honestly want someone to shoot me in the head. She also has way too high expectations for things she really has no reason; for example, Emma wants to get a promotion, but she literally, without any exaggeration, seems to suck at every aspect of her job. And to make matters worse, she doesn\u2019t just want a promotion, she actually thinks she is going to get one (fairly so, in her opinion), but girl.. for what? For what reason would anyone want to promote you? Mad. Absolutely bonkers.I have to admit though, Emma did have some personal growth in the end, but not enough by a long mile and I wasn\u2019t impressed to say the least.Then we get to the main romance: Emma and Jack. Oh.. where do I start? Simply said: I just wasn\u2019t having it. Their chemistry was non-existent. I didn\u2019t like either of them and I also couldn\u2019t quite understand why any of them would like the other so much. It felt forced and kind of came out of nowhere.As opposed to the main romance, this book does have a good female friendship in Emma and Izzy. They go way back and are always there for one another. They even do these little things together that make their friendship seem organic and realistic. I liked it.Now.. the humour. I was promised a humorous chick-lit, but instead I got an eye-roll worthy cringe fest. I think most of the things that were meant to be \u201chilarious\u201d just made me uncomfortable or annoyed. Well no, alright, alright, I am overreacting. It was indeed enjoyable at times, but not what I\u2019d call funny. I didn\u2019t laugh out loud one time, maybe a smile once or twice.

So many witty quotes, comedic flukes, and engaging relationships fill this book, particularly past its midpoint. If the really gripping situations had begun earlier, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more.

It was just adorable. It really was. If there is one thing that Sophie Kinsella knows how to do, it is fluffy books and fun dialogue. Honestly I spent most of the book snickering and giggling. I even laughed out loud at times which is rare for me. Emma is a typical young adult. She is trying to find her place in this world. She also has a bunch of secrets she has kept from her friends, family and co workers. On a super scary plane ride, in a fit of panic, she tells a complete stranger every single little secret. Then that stranger turns out to be her boss. Emma was fun. I love her dialogue and her thought process. She was completely irrational at times but she meant well. I enjoyed learning about all her secrets. In all honesty, her secrets weren't that bad but they did hurt the feelings of several people she knew. I was really rooting for her and Jack. They had such a fun chemistry even though it was kind of insta love. Sometimes, insta love isn't always a bad thing. If you are looking for an in between book or a light read after reading some heavy stuff, I suggest this book.

This was a book club pick, as I hadn't read any Sophie Kinsella before, but had certainly heard of her. A little more chick lit than my usual tastes, and it's probably the Barbie dream house pink cover, but I wouldn't have picked this on my own. Isn't that why we go to book clubs though, to read books we wouldn't have selected? So I read it, and it was light and fluffy and a very easy read. Certainly lighter and fluffier and a more enjoyable read than Tangerine which I just finished yesterday. It was a breath of fresh air. I loved that she was totally pulling off first person present tense, all from Emma's POV. This is my favorite POV, and sometimes people say it's only acceptable in YA lit. Emma's not ancient, but she's no teenager. Jack was a decent protagonist, but I really thought his big secret was that he wasn't really American because he said some things that really aren't American. He said some beverage was his favorite tipple. What? And he didn't ever mention what part of America he's from. We Americans can't help ourselves, and there are huge regional differences. And then, at the costume party, he's dressed like a cowboy? This whole scene reminded me of an episode of Peppa Pig where the nursery school kids had to dress like the countries of the world and the dog character was supposed to be American so they dressed him like a cowboy.

Then again, don't all her books?Emma is a typical twenty-something year old, fully complete with a self-depreciating inner dialogue and a whiny, melodramatic, over-the-top, I-want-to-slap-the-moron-out-of-you personality...but she seems quite aware of that, which makes it a bit more bearable. The plot is one of your run-of-the-mill chick-lit types, including and not limited to; (view spoiler)[ revenge on her bitchy, all-adored, arch-nemesis cousin Kerry that has always been putting her down; dumping her wonderfully attractive boyfriend Connor because she didn't realize UNTIL THE VERY MOMENT SHE MET JACK, that she was blinded by his looks and she never really had any actual feelings for him; revealing to her parents that they adored the wrong child for years and that they should have been on her side all along; having a sweet and supportive best friend/roommate called Lissy who stands by her side no matter what, having another annoying roommate called Jemima who is a spoiled rich kid but somehow decides to live with two roommates in what I gather is a not-so-palace-like flat; co-workers that are mostly mean and spiteful, except that one really sweet airhead; and finally, Jack, the man of her dreams who also comes equipped with a ton of cash, his own company, excellent bedroom skills, a fancy car, a bodygaurd/friend/what-is-this-guy called Sven, a secret that only Emma knows (kind of), and is ABSOLUTELY SMITTEN by Emma for the very traits that she doesn't find special. THEN it goes a little something like this...there's a betrayal, then some desperate clamoring and clattering while Jack tries to explain things to Emma who is ADAMANT that she not hear him out, followed by forgiveness because it was all a big misunderstanding, then another betrayal that wasn't a betrayal but looked like one and thenEmma has to explain to Jack and he doesn't want to listen and he walks away but then HE REALIZES SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT and comes back and apologizes and opens up to her and so begins their wonderful life together. Cut to the epilogue, Emma still has a few secrets that are endearing and innocent and can't possibly cause any more drama. Thus, implying that she will live her life free of any unexpected debacles and together forever with the super-rich man of her dreams and everything she has ever wanted.

There is literally nothing about this book that is good. The plot is terrible. The characters are not even remotely likeable and you don't really get to \"know\" any of them. The main character, Emma, is a shallow, entitled, flakey, mess that has absolutely no self-respect. She acts like a dramatic teenager who doesn't know how to control their emotions. She's either on the verge of tears or stunned by panic. There's no in-between. That would be okay if the things she experienced warranted that kind of behaviour, but it's usually something incredibly menial like picking a restaurant that ended up being closed for a private function. After completely botching her first client meeting, she spills her \"secrets/unnecessary lies\" on a turbulent plane ride to her seat mate and the story just gets worse from there. Every secret Emma has is stupid and her efforts to keep them secret are a wasted investment, but she's so concerned about being liked by everyone that she just manufactured a fake version of herself. One that pretends to like jazz just because her loser boyfriend does or pretends she weighs less than she does because...who the hell knows?! She has to do this because, somehow, every single person she encounters in her daily life from her parents to her roommates to her co-workers are absolutely horrible people. Emma is the kind of woman I would never want to be and I genuinely wonder if women like her even exist outside of trope-y books that require spineless dimwits in order to propel weak plots and create faux drama. She's struggling to find herself and her passion which is completely normal and yet she and her ridiculous family have this warped idea that she should already be a CEO or some shit when she's only 25. Seriously, her family is THE WORST! They are the farthest thing from supportive and even go so far as to make her feel like she's less than because her piece of shit cousin has managed to find success. For her family not to realize what a bag of trash the cousin is while simultaneously being patronizing pricks themselves is so unbelievable it almost manages to quell my rage every time I read their interactions. Instead of calling her family out on their bullshit, Emma spends her time obsessing over achieving a promotion that she is 100% not entitled to in an effort to \"show them!\" Her priorities are so remarkably skewed, I don't even know how she's managed to keep the job she's in; certainly not out of skill or performance.**SPOILERS AHEAD**Eventually it is revealed that the man on the plane that knows all of her silly secrets is the founder of the very same company Emma works for, Panther Cola. Jack has the personality of a wet mop and while I assume he must be at least 10 years older than Emma given the level of success he has achieved, the book avoids the subject of his age altogether. Somehow, Jack develops an interest in Emma despite the fact that she is a bumbling fool and encourages her to break things off with her boyfriend, Conner. To be fair, Conner is insufferable, but up until the moment she met Jack, Emma was perfectly content being insufferable alongside him because people thought they were perfect together and appearances are all that matter to Emma. After they meet again, this time in a professional setting, Jack leverages the information Emma revealed to him in a moment of fear against her to make little comments that make her feel uncomfortable and/or worried. His reason for visiting is never really elaborated on or developed, nor are any of the relationships that Emma has. You really never get to know any of the characters at all. The entire focus of the book is on Emma's attempt to keep up her fa\u00e7ade while simultaneously trying to have a clandestine relationship with Jack that is rife with drama.Jack has no charisma. He's bland and boring and he and Emma have no chemistry. Indeed, the lack of chemistry is so palpable that I can only surmise that the reason Emma enters a relationship with him is because he's good looking and wealthy. He thinks that because she spilled the beans to him on the short flight from Glasgow to London, that he somehow knows everything there is to know about her. Despite being a supposedly intelligent business man that has risen to success by building a brand based on knowing his target market, he has remarkably little insight into Emma. To be fair, Emma has no insight into Emma, so expecting Jack to is probably a bit unfair.They go from zero to sex in less than a week even after Jack learns that Emma, an alleged adult, has a Barbie bed spread. Apparently he likes that in a woman and Emma must have the orgasm of her life because suddenly believes she's in love. Yup. Love. She knows absolutely nothing about him because he is a closed off robot, but I guess the sex is good so Emma falls in love. Emma's roommate and friend Lissy tries to inject some common sense into the conversation by asking Emma what she really knows about Jack, but she won't listen. She's convinced herself that he loves her too and sure, they've kept their relationship a secret at work, but that's because they've only known each other for 5 minutes (certainly not for HR purposes).Randomly, Jack is set to give a live interview and apparently it's the most watched event on TV because everyone in Emma's life tunes in to see it. Somehow, this brilliant, successful business man gets lost in thought on national TV and starts describing the target market for a new product that ultimately ends up being a very obvious description of Emma. In the process he reveals most of her secrets and everybody figures out he's talking about her. Even though she's gotten herself into a situation where she's been making up unnecessary lies, she is rightfully embarrassed to have them revealed on national TV. Everyone in her life acts like a bunch of tactless buffoons and start prying further into her life because nobody in this book has any boundaries or common courtesy. Emma cries to her roommates and one of them, Jemima, recommends seeking revenge by revealing one of his secrets to the public. Since Emma doesn't know him, there's not much for her to go on other than the fact that they met on a flight back from Glasgow that he asked her not to tell anybody about. Jack comes slinking back to apologize before Emma has the opportunity to formulate a revenge plan and provides the lame ass excuse that Emma was on his mind and that's why he had verbal diarrhea. She was on her way to buying it when Jack inadvertently let it slip that the reason he doesn't share his secrets with Emma is because his are actually important and then acts like he did Emma a favour by spilling hers on national TV.Emma's parents throw money at her in an attempt to salvage their relationship. Her father trips over himself while trying to apologize because apparently it's much easier to cut your own daughter down on a regular basis than it is to tell her you love her. Emma gets a backbone for 5 seconds and tells her coworkers that she was the one with the idea to put an ad that ended up being successful in a bowling magazine and her boss gives her a promotion even though she hasn't demonstrated any proficiency at her job. Jack, being the creepy guy who can't take no for an answer, tracks Emma down at her roommates dance recital and reveals to her why he went to Glasgow. To be fair, he had every reason to keep it a secret and for Emma to expect him to be 100% forthcoming with a big secret that has far reaching implications after only a week of knowing one another demonstrates the level of high-school thinking she has. Things are looking like they are about to be smoothed over when Jemima, Emma's sociopathic roommate calls a journalist and tries for force Emma, despite her numerous objections, to reveal dirt on Jack. Jack walks in on Jemima, Emma and the journalist and Emma does a classic Emma and can't form a coherent sentence to explain what's happening and Jack storms off. I wish the book ended there because they all would have gotten what they deserved and I would've felt a lot better about having spent my time reading this garbage.Instead, Emma sits and throws herself a pity party. Jack comes back and starts prattling off his \"secrets\" which are really just pieces of information about himself that any normal person would eventually tell someone as their relationship developed, like when he lost his virginity and that he doesn't like caviar. Emma is, of course, beyond impressed with this mediocre display and even goes so far as to tell Jack that he doesn't have to tell her anything else. Honestly, Emma is so weak it's infuriating. Her expectations for the people she surrounds herself with are so low and she's so needy that she would put up with a totally unbalanced relationship over being alone and/or getting her shit together. The book ends by attempting to show how Emma has grown and learned lessons from this whole mess, but it rings hollow, just like everything else in this miserable book. Emma got the hot, rich boyfriend and the title of Marketing Executive, both of which she doesn't deserve and is probably going to screw up if she doesn't invest as much energy into getting comfortable with herself as she does in petty secrets/gossip. Not that I expect rom-com books to be pieces of feminist literature, but everything in this book is so awful that I am genuinely sad it was written by a woman. If anything, it could double as a guide for women on what not to do in life. Maybe that's the silver lining...", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "33724.Can_You_Keep_a_Secret_", "book_id": "33724", "book_title": "Can You Keep a Secret?", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2834250472", "review_id": "2834250472", "date": "May 27, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Melissa", "user_url": "/user/show/4912586-melissa", "text": "This was a four star book that gets bumped up to a five because of the WONDERFUL Kate Reading narration. Seriously, she was AMAZING. Can You Keep a Secret? is a chick lit book that is witty and fun, and I really feel like half of the fun was hearing Kate Reading's narration of Emma's first person narration. She brought Emma to life in a way that few audio narrators manage to pull off. I could feel her anxiety and her irritations. I could feel her vulnerability and her anger. I really felt like I was inside Emma's head. This is my first Sophie Kinsella book, and I can see why she is a popular writer. I see why this book is compared to books like Bridget Jones' Diary. It has that same sort of feel to it. The premise of this story was super cute. Emma has a fear of flying, and on one trip her plane hits some severe turbulence, causing Emma to start blurting out all of the secrets that she has never told anyone. I loved that scene. The plane does not crash, but that shouldn't be a problem, right? She'll never see her seatmate again, right? Well, it turns out that she does see him again. He is the owner and founder of her company. Lots of anxiety and fun ensues. As far as the story goes, I really enjoyed it. I think that there was a lot of time in the middle of the book where nothing was really going on. I didn't mind it so much because I did enjoy being in Emma's head due to the great narration. But I wonder if I would have been as patient if I was reading it myself. I don't know. I enjoyed the romance too, but when compared to other contemporary romances, I could probably only rate this as average. But I couldn't help but root for Emma and hope that she could find a beginning to a happily ever after. Jack was okay. His grand secret seemed a bit lame when it came out, but I forgive him.

I wasn't supposed to read anything before my exams were all done. And here I am, writing a review for the book I wasn't supposed to read and I\u2019m sure there will be a couple more such books this month. Drat!The book is about Emma Corrigan, an ordinary, nothing-special girl living in London. She, like every other woman on the planet, has a few secrets that she shares with nobody. Until, one day, she spills them all to a stranger on the plane. Unfortunately for her, this man turns out to be the CEO of the company she works in.I\u2019ve decided to share a few of my secrets involving this book. Can you keep a few secrets?1. I read a majority of this while on public transport and my expressions attracted a lot of attention. Some people gave me strange looks and I\u2019m quite sure they thought I was a mad person. Eh, whatever!2. I read a part of this book till about 5 o\u2019clock in the morning. When I was supposed to be sleeping. My father must never know this. Never!3. I may have a little crush on Jack Harper. That was before a very stupid thing that he did. He did try to redeem himself but I couldn't forgive him completely.4. I didn\u2019t like Emma as much as I thought I would. (Does that count as a secret?)5. Okay fine, I hate Emma because she took Jack away from me!! I have been crying ever since. I still haven\u2019t been able to overcome the trauma.6. I did not like the ending at all. It felt too rushed and I was left wanting more. That\u2019s one reason I knocked off a star from my original rating of 4 stars. Had this been a series, I would have understood the reason behind such an ending, but it isn't. It\u2019s a standalone book and the ending did not do justice to the fun ride that this book had become.7. This is my third book by Sophie Kinsella, which includes her Shopaholic series and I don\u2019t like the fact that she keeps writing the same thing over and over again. The books that I've read all have an adorably clueless heroine, a relatively rich, crush-worthy hero, funny banter and a happy ending with lots of embarrassing moments thrown in. It\u2019s predictable and I\u2019d like to read one book by her that doesn't have all this again. I\u2019d really love it if she writes about some other character in another scenario because I think even with that she can make the reader laugh out loud. Well here\u2019s hoping..8. In spite of it all, I\u2019m going to re-read this book someday. It was quite funny and the embarrassing and awkward moments were just HILARIOUS!9. Now comes my funniest secret regarding this book. I convinced a guy friend that this book is a mystery involving government secrets and he is actually currently reading it. He was a little put off by the pink cover but after I told him it was supposed to be ironic, he agreed to read it. I just keep imagining what will happen when he finishes reading the book. I will probably get to hear some lovely cuss words.10. I've already started another book. Goodbye to my No-reading in July pledge. Oh well.And now, I bestow upon Sophie Kinsella the title Queen of Awkward Moments. I wonder how she comes up with such hilariously awkward moments that make you laugh out loud. My shrieks of laughter on the train while reading this book did attract some horrified looks from co-passengers. But I don\u2019t even care. Some of the humour might not work for others but there sure are moments in the book that are genuinely adorable.
