The author doesn't have to introduce the universe or the characters, as they did in the first installment, but they don't need to worry about wrapping up all the plot points either. Instead, the focus can be on 'the good stuff': elaborating on the story, teasing us more, giving action, chopping off Luke's hand and so on. Instead of the good stuff, in The Subtle Knife I feel as though we've had a bait and switch pulled on us.In The Golden Compass, we were treated to a rich alternate universe that had elements that were similar to our own, like some of the geopolitical structure, and elements that were entirely fantastical, like armored polar bears and witches. The Subtle Knife, however decides that most of this is insignificant and takes place almost entirely in different universes. It seems like Philip Pullman wanted to reel us in with fantasy before he could preach at us.Some of these elements are expanded upon in The Amber Spyglass, which I'm currently reading, so forgive me if they don't all apply. I had heard before I started the series that they were 'about killing God.' This seemed highly unlikely, and was probably a knee-jerk reaction from people who heard it from other people who read a synopsis of the book, etc. But... no. Some of the main characters have decided to wage war on 'The Authority.'Herein lies my main concern with the series as a whole: it's not (excuse the pun) subtle. I'm an agnostic, so these complaints don't come from someone insulted by the material, they come from someone unhappy by their handling. I love plots that put a spin on traditional religion (Waiting for the Galactic Bus, for example), but it seems like Pullman came up with a story involving a culture's religion and then decided to make it fit with the Judeo-Christian framework no matter how hard he had to push.The concept of Dust is interesting. Adapting it to fit with concepts of physics in our world works because it uses something we only know a little about. Once you try to toss in angels and consciousness and so on (which is insulting in a children's book, as he's claiming that children are entirely self involved until puberty), though, it seems contrived and silly.I may have been more willing to swallow his philosophy, such as it is, if there hadn't been a complete lack of the elements I liked in The Golden Compass: there were no Gyptians, there were no panserbj\u00f6rne... they seem to make a reappearance in the final book of the series, but why spend so much time on their culture in the first book if you aren't going to include them in the second? (I know that the panserbj\u00f6rne's culture is basically that of any warrior society, but they're still armored polar bears and the ten year old in me think that's awesome)It's not so much that the book is bad, per se, though I do think it becomes too dark for the age group I initially thought it was written for. I just don't think Pullman is writing for the same reason I want to read: he wants to write religious commentary while I want to read fantasy.", "num_likes": 233, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1110169977", "review_id": "1110169977", "date": "Nov 19, 2014", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Sean Barrs ", "user_url": "/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs", "text": "When I read this the first time I completely overlooked a main component of the book. I approached it as if was the second book in the series, a massive mistake. I wrote a review criticising the fact that the novel felt awkward; it had no beginning or end: it just felt like the typical content you\u2019d find in the middle of the story. The ironic point of this is that most critics take the trilogy as one whole book, rather than three separate works. And this really is the best way to approach the story.  The Golden Compass  is the beginning of it all, the setting of the stage. This, then, is the middling part of the work. The second protagonist of the series, the Adam to Pullman\u2019s Eve, takes the lead here. Initially, I was very resistant to this idea. I had grown to respect Lyra; she\u2019s a really strong heroine, but after a while it started to make sense. Pullman has expanded his story considerably. Lyra has three chapters told from her perspective. The same amount, roughly speaking, is told from the perspective of Will. The rest of the chapters are from side characters of the previous book. So there\u2019s a strong move away from a Lyra centred story.  I have mixed feeling about this. It felt like an odd authorial decision. At times this felt like an entirely different series altogether, again, something I eventually got over. There is no sense of closure at the end of this. The first book had a strong ending, but this has very little. This book seemed to be a mere set-up for the next instalment, which makes it rather difficult to review; it\u2019s like picking out the middle bit of a story and trying to criticise it as a separate entity from the rest of it: it\u2019s not easy to do. Any criticism you make are negated by the fact that this is not a separate book: it\u2019s a chunk of a greater work. So I\u2019m going to read the third book before I speak any more about this- I need to see where these elements Pullman added go to. Perhaps a review of all three works together would be the best option. At this moment though, I find the witches one of the most interesting aspects of the work. I\u2019m not entirely sure what to make of them as of yet. Hopefully, the third book will give me all the answers I need. \"All through that day the witches came, like flakes of black snow on the wings of a storm, filling the skies with the darting flutter of their silk and the swish of air through the needles of their cloud-pine branches. Men who hunted in the dripping forests or fished among melting ice-floes heard the sky-wide whisper through the fog, and if the sky was clear they would look up to see the witches flying, like scraps of darkness drifting on a secret tide.\"  ", "num_likes": 154, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "sci-fi", "children-of-all-ages", "3-star-reads"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4460795933", "review_id": "4460795933", "date": "Jan 09, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Lea", "user_url": "/user/show/38055348-lea", "text": "\u201cI found folly everywhere, but there were grains of wisdom in every stream of it.\u201dI\u2019m a bit torn about the second instalment in His Dark Materials, The Subtle Knife. The whole story feels a bit rushed and short, on which I feel Pullman put a lot of weight on, wanting to introduce new characters, giving the old and the new characters psychological depth and development, having a lot of action, engaging in scientific thought experiments, commenting on politics and anthropology and giving a critique of religion and Christian God. It is a lot of expectations for ya/children's fantasy book with 250 pages. But one thing is certain, Pullman knows how to write a gripping story, as the pace is perfect and prose simply flows which makes the reading process undemanding and pleasurable.I like the newly introduced character of Will Perry, the male protagonist that accompanies Lyra on her adventures. Will is a child of a mentally ill mother that he needs to take care of, and an absent father explorer he is endlessly longing for. The rawness of emotion that this longing is described with made me think Will is in a way mirroring Pullman himself, and interestingly, later on, I found out that Pullman sadly lost his father when he was 7 when his father was killed as a pilot in a plane crash. \u201cHe wiped the sweat out of his eyes with his right hand. What he couldn\u2019t say was that he longed for his father as a lost child yearns for home. That comparison wouldn\u2019t have occurred to him, because home was the place he kept safe for his mother, not the place others kept safe for him. But it had been five years now since that Saturday morning in the supermarket when the pretend game of hiding from the enemies became desperately real, such a long time in his life, and his heart craved to hear the words \u201cWell done, well done, my child; no one on earth could have done better; I\u2019m proud of you. Come and rest now.\u2026\u201dWe again have a strong theme of parent/authority figure absence in the life of a child, that is present throughout the trilogy. Lyra grew up with no parents by her side, and Will has no memory of a father and has a mother that is not well, for who he has to take care of as she is his child. Here we see the reverse of the role of parent and a child, so often seen in real life, where a child is in a way robbed from his own childhood due to the fact it has to take adult responsibility prematurely due to the parent inadequacy. Which can be caused by the mental or physical illness of a parent, substance or alcohol abuse or even just emotional immaturity, when the parent expects their child to solve his own problems and carry his burden. That can eventually create all kinds of psychological disturbances in a child identifying with a role of savior, creating overly expressed altruism, neglecting his own needs in relationships and having immense guilt about having own thoughts and emotions, depression, as well as a feeling of discomfort living for self, not exclusively for others in constant effort and overwork. \u201c...and partly his longing for his mother. He was afraid for her, of course, and he knew she\u2019d be safer if he was there to look after her; but he wanted her to look after him, too, as she\u2019d done when he was very small. He wanted her to bandage him and tuck him into bed and sing to him and take away all the trouble and surround him with all the warmth and softness and mother-kindness he needed so badly; and it was never going to happen. Part of him was only a little boy still. So he cried, but he lay very still as he did, not wanting to wake Lyra.\u201dA lot of stories also revolves around the theme of the chosen child, in both Lyra and Will, exploring the pressure children carry on themselves in being a new beginning for the generation, somewhat the savior that can lift the sins of predecessors and finish all the good deeds in which they failed and even do much more, having the pressure of righting all the wrongs in the universe, and in a way birthing a new way of life for the world. \"You witches know something about the child Lyra.... Tell me the truth.... Name her!\" \"Eve! Mother of all!... Mother Eve!\"\u201cOne day, you\u2019ll follow in your father\u2019s footsteps. You\u2019re going to be a great man too. You\u2019ll take up his mantle.\u201dContinuing on the theme of multiple universes we are introduced to the world of Cittigazze, the children\u2019s world where only children prevail as the adults are haunted by Specters, creatures that feed of consciousness and induce a state of disintegration, the madness of the mind. Pullman toyed around with the idea of consciousness connecting it to physics of the dark matter in scientific ideas, and to Angels, spirits, in a religious manner which as an end result seemed somewhat confusing, but acceptable in the vain that different disciplines may explore and try to understand the same thing under a different name. As Katia N brilliantly pointed in the comment of my review of the first instalment, Pullman\u2019s theory of dust is akin to panpsychism, the concept of consciousness in which \"the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe\". Panpsychism has a long history in philosophical traditions of both East and West, and is also revived in analytic philosophy. Contrary to dualism, for Pullman, mind and matter are not fundamentally different kinds of things.  \u201cAngels are creatures of Shadow matter? Of Dust? STRUCTURES. COMPLEXIFICATIONS. YES.And Shadow matter is what we have called spirit? FROM WHAT WE ARE, SPIRIT; FROM WHAT WE DO, MATTER. MATTER AND SPIRIT ARE ONE.\u201dPullman certainly becomes more prominent in the theme of moral inversion, as he is bluntly opposed to the Church while depending heavily on Christian symbolism, basically creating a multiverse of different worlds, all Christian, in striving to re-write Paradise Lost and Genesis, making the original sin the act of liberty in creating a new dawn for mankind and fallen Angels rightful rebels against the tyrant God. Pullman gives not an only critique of the Church, he declares a war on Christian God he wants to overthrow. \u201cThe God who dies is the God of the burners of heretics, the hangers of witches... [T]hat God deserves to die. The Authority, then, is an ancient Idea of God, kept alive artificially by those who benefit from his continued existence.\u201dHe perceives a Church as the morally corrupt, the wrong side of good, the machinery of lies, propaganda, cruelty and deceit for thousands of years of human history. \u201cThat is what the Church does, and every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\u201dAgain, I already talked about how I think Pullman is influenced by  Nietzsche's philosophy which also becomes even more evident in this instalment. Pullman has a similar standpoint to Nitzsche's notion of Christian morals presented in The Birth of Tragedy; that unconditional will of Christianity to recognize only moral values is dangerous \u201cwill to disown life\u201d in its core, and it surfeits life in the hatred of the world and fear of beauty and sensuality. \u201cIt is the Magisterium, the Church. For all its history\u2014and that\u2019s not long by our lives, but it\u2019s many, many of theirs\u2014it\u2019s tried to suppress and control every natural impulse. And when it can\u2019t control them, it cuts them out. \u201dThis also confirms the opinion I expressed in the review for Northern Lights, that I believe that Pullman's main philosophy is Gnosticism, believing that evil creator God and his angels caused ignorance and imprisonment. And fallen angels are consciousness and they lead others to consciousness, freedom and the greater state of being. \u201cThere are two great powers,\u201d the man said, \u201cand they\u2019ve been fighting since time began. Every advance in human life, every scrap of knowledge and wisdom and decency we have has been torn by one side from the teeth of the other. Every little increase in human freedom has been fought over ferociously between those who want us to know more and be wiser and stronger, and those who want us to obey and be humble and submit.\u201dHe puts the emphasis on personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis), found in alethiometer, shaman experiences, devotion to science experiments or magic of witches, above the teachings, traditions, and authority of religious institutions. And to reach that kind of spiritual knowledge, Pullman gives instructions with quoting Keats; you have to be \u201cCapable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.\" You have to get into that state of mind.\u201dHere is where I get confused about the genre of the book. The problem is, the book is written in style children or ya fantasy would be written, as I would expect for the adult fantasy to have a more solidly constructed world and characters and to be much more elaborate in ideas. But the thing is, for understanding the concepts Pullman unveils in the trilogy, you have to be fairly well-read and acquainted in both theology and philosophy, favorably even physics. I don't think that a child or even a young adult could grasp the essence of Pullman's ideas, which left me quite confused when I was reading His Dark Materials as a child, not even being able to pinpoint what I don't like (spoiler; I did not like that I could not understand the concepts I vaguely understand now, many years of education and books after). I'm struggling to determine who is the perfect audience for the novels, as they are not (at least the first two) in ideas enough developed to satisfy you as a philosophical debate and are maybe too philosophical for younger reads who just want to read fantasy. (As someone wittily put in their review; I just want to read fantasy, and Pullman wants to have philosophical debate). But, no matter if one agrees or does not agree to core beliefs presented in the novels or with all the choices the author made, it is undeniable that Pullman is a brilliant craftsman of fantasy that created a legendary trilogy worth reading.", "num_likes": 110, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "philosophy", "fiction", "owned"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2555410225", "review_id": "2555410225", "date": "Oct 15, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "~Poppy~", "user_url": "/user/show/59201076-poppy", "text": "\n\n\u201cEvery little increase in human freedom has been fought over ferociously between those who want us to know more and be wiser and stronger, and those who want us to obey and be humble and submit.\u201d \n\n", "num_likes": 156, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/444030962", "review_id": "444030962", "date": "Oct 29, 2012", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "user_url": "/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "text": "The Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials, #2), Philip Pullman The Subtle Knife, the second book in the His Dark Materials series, is a young-adult fantasy novel written by Philip Pullman and published in 1997.

A friend, or an enemy?\u201d...\u201cHe is a murderer.\u201dThis book has the introduction of Will; a young man/boy who is compassionate, caring, brave and a warrior. After a frightening account, Will has to go on the run where he escapes to a different world to the deserted city of Cittagaze, and meets an interesting girl called Lyra Belacqua, her Daemon; Pantalaimon and her ability to read a strange instrument called the alethiometer. This strange world runs parallel to his own. They learn to begin to trust each other and their fates become intertwined, each relying on their developing friendship, courage and bravery. They discover strange mishaps in this strange city and learn of a powerful weapon- the subtle knife that is so powerful it can cut through worlds. A knife that will only respond to the hand intended to wield it.Like the first book, this was a wonderful literary adventure. This book takes off where the first book ended and Lyra has travelled to another world, staying in the deserted city alone for a few days before the surprise meeting with Will. I loved the developing dynamics of Will and Lyra\u2019s friendship.This hold more multiple points of view than in the first book, with storylines from Lee Scoresby and Serafina Pekkala especially. This, again contained heartbreak, deaths and dark creatures/story lines. However, there is the brightness of a developing friendship, strong bravery, and many connections between the plot lines are made and fit into place.

It was well over ten. Ten people wanted me to send that email on to everyone I know, telling them the same thing. Don't see this movie! Don't read these books! Alert! Alert! Alert!Nothing like calling attention to something like a planned boycott. I haven't seen the movie, because I'm cheap and it's not something I'd take my kids to or something I'd be prone to see anyway, but as I had already read the first book in the series, enjoyed it and hadn't found it to be Anti-God, I was curious to read the next to see what the fuss was all about.I don't know if the emails worked and I read with a bias, but I did not enjoy this second book. Not because it is Anti-God...which it really isn't, but more anti organized religion and organized religion's version of god, but because the writing is bad.Dialogue - choppy.Descriptions - cliched. (how do I get that little accent marking over the e?)Storyline - totally falters.I felt enormously disappointed in the direction of this book. Lyra, the young female protagonist in search of dust and her father, all but disappears in this second story. She still plays a part, but now as the sidekick to Will, a new character who is a giant \"young adult fiction\" stereotype (in search of the father he never knew while protecting his mother from bad guys and seems to be gifted in the combat department). I don't remember the writing being bad in the first book. I thought it descriptive and unique and thoughtful. Not so, in The Subtle Knife. Pullman changes gears and loses focus. There is a lot more going on and none of it is developed well. I stopped caring about the characters and their goals.I think these books had great potential. There could be a lot to discuss with adolescents (not young children...at all). The nature of the soul, the natural man, the costs and benefits of religions. All appropriate things to discuss with youth ready to question and discover on their own.Pullman takes that conversation away with his lack of metaphor. It becomes impossible to argue, \"I think the dust means this.\" or \"what do you think The Authority is for Pullman?\" when he throws his opinion at you with real life Christian beliefs. It's inappropriate and unfair. Write a fantasy or a satire or a parable if you want to. Other authors have done it...and done it well.Pullman didn't.I won't be reading the third book.", "num_likes": 59, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/409232252", "review_id": "409232252", "date": "Sep 07, 2012", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Dave Schaafsma", "user_url": "/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma", "text": "I share this review again in the fall of 2017 as a fourth volume (though Pullman later wrote two companion pieces to the trilogy, entitled Lyra's Oxford, and Once Upon a Time in the North), The Book of Dust, has been released, to encourage all ages to read. As with most great \"children's\" books, there are a range of levels on which Pullman is working. He's taking on the Roman Catholic view of reality, C.S. Lewis (in The Chronicles of Narnia), and is in conversation with John Milton, whose Paradise Lost he both loves and contends with in places. But you don't need to know any of that to love this series.This is the middle book in the trilogy, and I like the first and third volumes more, big surprise. More exposition, less action, more trudging to final destinations, but you know, the writing is still exquisite, and it has surprises. One key surprise is that after focusing on Lyra in the first series, this second book opens with a focus on yet another central character, Will. When I first read this I was confused, and more than a little disappointed, as I saw a wonderful strong girl character shoved aside as usually happens in all books for a BOY main character. That isn't quite how things work, really, though, as they share the stage, and they open up new vistas and back stories and new worlds together. This is seen as a sixth grade children's series, but in truth, the older you are, the more you will get out of it, as in all of the greatest \"children's stories\" of all time, including The Wrinkle in Time, and so on. Pullman is taking on our limited view of \"reality\"-- he's engaging in physics, theology, anthropology--with a laser beam on the Holy Roman Church in particular. It's not so much an attack on The Church as an exploration of the nature of true religion, and a wider, more generous, less sin-obsessed view of the world. It's a wonderful series, which I listened to while traveling around the country with the family, a wonderfully produced cd series. It's the second volume of a trilogy, so you obviously don't begin here, but you won't regret the time you spend on the adventure. It's awesome. And whether you have read it or not, I recommend this audio version, with Philip Pullman Himself narrating, joined by a wonderful cast of characters.

Why? Well, because there was all that talk about how it got made into a movie. I read the book, and found it very thought provoking. As for the movie it's a watered down version of Pullman's work, but not bad for the most part. I mean, I don't think it would go over too well with audiences who haven't read to book to know that Lyra's friend Roger is killed by Lord Asreil and that Mrs. Coulter actually wants to control Lyra and in The Subtle Knife decide that yeah, she has to die. Just for a quick overview of Phillip Pullman's contraversal work and why it's a contraversy. There are three books in the series called, His Dark Material: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. The title of the series comes from a phrase Milton uses in Paradise Lost, which for those who don't know is a 16th century epic poem about Satan's great Fall from Heaven and the mischief he does in getting Adam and Eve to commit Original Sin. The books are about a rebellious girl named Lyra Belacqua, who comes from a world like the one we know, but is also very different. I guess you could say it's a warped version of the Victorian period. In Lyra's world, people have \"deamons,\" which are external forms of people's soul in the form of animals(Lyra's daemon is named Pantalaimon). She gets a hold of a golden compass, a device called an alethiometer, which at first she doesn't know how to use, but soon finds that it allows her to see into the past, present, and future. There is also the issue of a substance called Dust, which surronds all human life. The Church, also called the Magistrium, a very tyrannical and oppressive hand that acts first and questions later, wants to destroy Dust and Lord Asriel (who we think is Lyra's uncle but, da da da!! it's actually her father). Mrs. Coulter, being a very powerful figure in the Church, tries to seduce Lyra in a world of privilge but soon realizes that Mrs. Coulter is trying to control her. Lyra, being a free spirit, doesn't take kindly to this. So she runs away, meeting up with gyptians, where she learns to read the althieometer; gets badass texan named Lee Scoresby (and his daemon Hester)talking armored bear named Iorek Byrnison to work with her; she gets kidnapped by Tarters and sent to Bolvanger discovers the sinister secret of the Church: they cut daemons and children apart in a process known as intercision and finds that Mrs. Coulter (who is da da da!! her mother!) is in charge of the whole operation; plans an escape for all the childern where she mets the witch queen, Serafina Pekkela, and the queen helps Lyra on her quest to find her father; and her friend Roger is killed by her own father Lord Asriel which results in the creatation of a bridge from his world into another. The story ends with a very pissed off Lyra following Lord Asriel into the new world.So yeah, a lot to take in. I just gave an overview! There are so many carefully thought out details that I have left out. For example: as a child, their daemon's have the ability to change from animal to animal. When the child reaches to adulthood, their daemons settle into one animal. Very cool right? So, what's the contraversy all about?One: Phillip Pullman is an out spoken atheist.Two: His Dark Materials are catagorized as childrens books. Three: You find out in The Subtle Knife that the big plan is to kill God.Yeah. The Subtle Knife introduces Will, who stummbles across a window to city called Citt\u00e0gazze on another world. There he meets Lyra. I would explain more, but you've already put up with me talking about the first book, so let me sum up for you by what the back of the book says:\"In this stunning sequel to The Golden Compass, the intrepid Lyra find herself in the simmering, hauinted otherworld-cittagazze, where soul-eating Specters stalk the streets and wingsbeats of angels sound against the sky. But she in not without allies: twelve-year-old Will Parry, feeling for his life after taking another's, has also stumbled into this strange new realm. On a perilous journey from world to world, Lyra and Will uncover a deadly secret: an object of extraordinary and devasting power. And with every step,they move closer to an even greater threat-and the shattering truth of their own destiny.\"I know you want to read it now just see what happens. Anyway, it's very amazing and disturbing and fantasic and all those things. I just finished reading The Subtle Knife today so I have yet to read The Amber Spyglass. When I do, I'll let you know.But why are these books good and why is Pullman on my Influential Writers list along with Donne, Plath, and Hemingway? Because he wrote a children's book version of Milton's Paradise Lost! Have you ever read it? Holy Crap! I had to read it twice while I was in college. Don't get me wrong. It's awesome. It is awe inspiring. Everyone should read it. But damnit, it's long and can be a little hard to read if you don't have someone there explaining it or Cliff Notes. In Milton's poem, Satan leads an army of rebellious angels in an attempt to overthrow God. The attempt fails, and Satan and his followers are cast out of heaven. Satan, seeking revenge, convinces God's creations, Adam and Eve, to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge, thus causing their fall from grace. In Pullman's take on Paradise Lost, God is an oppressive, senile old man, and Satan is a dashing heroic figure. But the real hero and centerpiece of Pullman's story is the Eve figure, Lyra Belacqua, on whom the salvation of the universe depends.Really? A children's book? Wow! That's what I said. So I raise my glass of Cranberry-Pomagrante Crystal Lite and vodka to Phillip Pullman for being the writer I want to be: original, brave, and honest. And to go off an a rant real quick:How can people protest and get all up in arms when they haven't even read/watched what they are getting upset about? Understandably, if you read Pullman's His Dark Materials, and you are against it, awesome. You know what are you talking about. I got really upset when people started attacking the movie without having read the book or even seen the movie. How do I know? Well, because I asked. Are people so afraid to have their ideology put into question? Do they not want to think critically, analyze what they believe in? I love being challenged. Good lord, what else do I have to do intellectualy until I light a fire under my ass and get my teaching certificate? It's okay to question what your faith and your beliefs. It allows you to see how strong you are in the decisions you have made.Sorry about that last rant there...but that had been building up for a while. Not just from Pullman's work, but also from a few other things that I would talk about but this blog is already long enough.Well, I hope you enjoyed me getting my nerd on.

On the one hand, it started off great. On the other hand, there are now quite a few POVs, some I care about, some I don't, and the world has literally been blown apart and expanded. I think I somehow prefer reading fantasy set in our world, maybe because it lends the reality I live in a touch of magic. And also because a new fantasy world is unknown territory and that can be scary sometimes. Which is not to say I dislike it. I'm a huge (high) fantasy fan. But I remember reading Inkheart by Cornelia Funke - I never finished reading the final book in the series because most of it was set in the fantasy world whereas the first two books were mainly set in our world. Anyway, all that pondering aside, I liked the beginning and the introduction to the new main character a lot. I liked seeing Lyra in our Oxford and I especially enjoyed the chapters with Mary Malone. Then Will and Lyra found themselves in Cittagazze and I really didn't like that world. The witches and Lee Scoresby got their own chapters and while they obviously added a lot to the story, I preferred reading about Lyra and Will.Honestly, it's super difficult for me to define what exactly I didn't enjoy in The Subtle Knife. The writing is great, the story is original and imaginative. Maybe it's the fact that Lyra's world was already rich enough without the addition of dozens of alternate universes. I enjoyed Lyra's Oxford, and I love reading about Iorek. Maybe it's one of those cases where you read a story and love it but it takes a completely different turn from what you expected and you're just not satisfied with where the plot is going. And additionally, while I think it's an exciting story, there are few characters that I really care about or find interesting. There's Iorek, there is Dr Malone, there is Mrs Coulter, sometimes there's Lyra. But Will doesn't spark any enthusiasm in me, and neither do most of the other characters. Overall, I feel...detached. Maybe that's the right word.I also can't get the fact out of my mind that a year ago, Pullman tweeted about the \"trans argument\" and didn't know what \"side\" he should be on. That leaves a very bitter aftertaste and while reading I always wonder whether I should be supporting an author who is so utterly confused about the mere existence of trans people.Find more of my books on Instagram ", "num_likes": 57, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["owned", "finished-series"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/179317938", "review_id": "179317938", "date": "Jun 24, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Shayantani", "user_url": "/user/show/5686305-shayantani", "text": "Two very strange things happened last week.

Lyra Belacqua reappears with her daemon Pantalaimon and although she doesn\u2019t play as central a role as the previous novel, she is so charming. I can not wait to find out the form Pantalaimon will finally take. Marisa Coulter and Serafina Pekkala are back and as interesting as ever. Lee Scoresby and his daemon are absolutely heartbreaking. A bandwagon of new and amazing characters like Stanislaus Grumman, Will Parry, Mary Malone is introduced. The friendship between Will and Lyra and Will and Pantalaimon were some of the best parts of the story. I would read the next book just to meet all these characters again. I am so glad I already have a copy of the next part. After that abrupt ending and the revelation about Lyra towards the end, having to wait for the next part would have been sheer torture.

And I suppose these days it is difficult to get on the training course and who knows if the pension scheme will be all that it was cracked out to be?Reading I thought this business of the human mind and the flow of consciousness through a multiplicity of universes reminded me of something else. As always it takes some days for this kind of thought to percolate down to the answer - I recalled something very similar from Anathem!At first my reaction was how marvellous it was that different authors had read similar things and developed an idea along related lines in parallel book universes, however once I double checked the publication dates I did feel a slight, entirely unwarranted, sourness towards Master Stephenson.In contrast to Northern Lights the story here rans over a much shorter time period, the cast of characters remained large, the deft reworking of Blake, Milton, and the Bible appeared to give away to Dark Matter, consciousness, and multiple universes, while the pace of the book was not maintained by one desperate fight after another. As much as I enjoy Zeppelins and Armoured Bears I appreciated the deployment of colours from a larger palate by the author. Continuing the theme of children in children's literature from my previous review the absence of parents from both Will and Lyra's lives is strikingly traditional. For Will he has had to become the adult figure in relation to his mother - and while the role of child carer is contemporary the fight between father and son each ignorant of the other's identity has a long history although here it is presented with a mild twist on the traditional tale (view spoiler)[ in that one doesn't kill the other (hide spoiler)]. Lyra in a way is a child without parents. Technically there are two people in the story who performed the physical functions both sufficient and necessary for Lyra to exist, but in regard to their behaviour and attitudes terminology such as parent, father, or mother seems cruelly inappropriate. Sometimes I hear the idea of there being for instance, a Catholic Atheist, told as a joke, admittedly I have had my sense of humour surgically removed, but the concept seems an entirely serious one to me. This trilogy is a strong example of it. The author does not share the faith of his ancestors but this is a work that could not exist without a tradition of religious dissent in England from the Geneva Bible, via Milton, and Blake. The power of their faith, the notions of predestination, free will, sin and grace, energise this trilogy. Fantastically, at this mid-way stage the rights and wrongs of rebellion and authority are still from clear cut, leaving the heroes, as every child is left, with untrustworthy, partisan, or uncertain guides as to their course of action.", "num_likes": 31, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["20th-century", "fantasy", "childrens-ya", "fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1410632557", "review_id": "1410632557", "date": "Oct 07, 2015", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Dannii Elle", "user_url": "/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "text": "This is the second instalment in the His Dark Materials series.Windows can be opened leading from one world to another and fearless Lyra has no qualms about venturing there.

This was a series that I\u2019d missed out on as a kid, and truth be told I was a little bit wary about starting them as an adult. Luckily, the first book in this series knocked my socks off, and this sequel followed in its footsteps and actually improved upon the original \u2013 in my opinion!The Subtle Knife picked up immediately where the first book ended, with Lyra waltzing out of one plane of reality and into another. From page one, Pullman packs this book with near nonstop wonder, intrigue, danger and excitement! It was actually quite surprising to see the ways in which this series has evolved from book one to two. Who knew that a book following a child\u2019s exploration into the arctic alongside her polar bear guardian to find her uncle would turn the tables so many times and end up becoming a universe-hopping fairytale filled with so many memorable characters? One of my absolutely favorite types of fantasy staples is the idea of portal fantasy \u2013 a function which allows one character to step from a familiar world into ones that are mysterious, dangerous and filled with wonder.Pullman takes that premise and expands upon it \u2013 and no, there\u2019s no blue box required for interdimensional travel. Lyra\u2019s universe has become a multiverse, one in which multiple worlds are converging on top of each other \u2013 basically meaning that anything is possible now in terms of where this story is headed. As much as I liked the adventure in the first book, I found this one even more exciting! My main issue with the first book was the way it starts. The reader is dropped right in the middle of a very important scene, given no context for anything and no idea what to consider important or not. It made for a really confusing start. Because the basics have already been told, this book was much clearer and more exciting from page one. The action and plotting felt tighter here, and I was overjoyed at the inclusion of Will \u2013 a new character to this book. He was a perfect foil for Lyra. I loved the way that they played off of one another, and how close they became as the result of actions within the plot.The one aspect of this book that I struggled with from time to time is the dialogue. I just don\u2019t really care for the way Pullman has his character\u2019s speak to one another. They\u2019re not so much engaging in dialogue as they are speechifying in long monologues said without pause, and then the next character picks it up right afterwards with a dramatic speech of their own.It seems to be less a fault of the writing than it is a stylistic choice of the narrative though, so I can\u2019t fault it greatly. There are just a few moments during these exchanges that I felt a bit pulled out of things, wondering when the next character was going to speak. Like the last book, this one is surprisingly dark considering it\u2019s marketed for children and teens. There was one surprisingly affecting scene that moved me way more than I expected it to, so good one for you there Mr. Pullman. I\u2019ll guard my heart a bit more carefully going in to book 3! This was a great read. It taught me to expect nothing and absolutely everything in the final book of this series. Can\u2019t wait to start it next month!\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272f = 4.5 out of 5 stars, rounded up for Goodreads______Follow me on Instagram @bookbastion", "num_likes": 29, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/412806678", "review_id": "412806678", "date": "Sep 12, 2012", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Mari", "user_url": "/user/show/7013001-mari", "text": "[May 21, 2019]Reading my original review from seven years ago is wild. I came back to this story and found something completely different here; I found myself completely different. There are still quibbles-- yes, some of the messaging is heavy handed and yes, Pullman's story style and world building is just slow-- but I was so focused on what this story wasn't that I couldn't appreciate what it was. I'll have full thoughts after we cover this on Snark Squad Pod, but for now, I'll say that I'm bumping this up to a 4.5 stars.[October 25, 2012]3 starsThis was hard. I think I should mention a couple of things: I'm reading HDM for the first time as an adult. I really, very much enjoyed The Golden Compass. I come from a religious background, which makes me sympathetic to the faults of organized religion, but I also still firmly believe in God. I started reading the books not because of the \"controversy\" per se, but more because I have a few dear, dear friends who call this their favorite. I was only vaguely aware of certain anti-religious elements of the story. For me, The Subtle Knife was not as good. The fact that I made it through the end is mostly a testament to my love for Lyra and Pan, and my (small)(but growing)(new) love for Will. I was interested in these characters and kept reading for a chance to know what might happen to them. Pullman, however, made it difficult for me. It wasn't even so much about the religious metaphors per se, but more about the fact that they stopped being metaphors somewhere along the line and became hammers. Anvils. I was in the middle of a sermon before I knew what happened. In book 2, we lose the intrigue of Lyra's world. We lose a lot of possibilities. Yes answers are good, in some cases, but here as we learn for certain what Dust is and what Asriel's mission is and what Lyra's part in it all is, you get tied down and suffocated by Pullman's big ideas which you! must! believe! Even though I was reading about her, I missed Lyra. I missed my brave girl on grand adventures, who cried yes, but was as courageous as any armoured bear. She became something lesser in this book, and I was sorry to see it. I really, really, really missed Pan. He was so absent here, and the beautiful and intricate relationship between Lyra and Pan was mostly gone, perhaps for a reason I'll discover in book 3, but it's absence was felt here. I missed being able to take my own interpretations and apply them to the book. Pullman abandons his clever and well thought out position of communicating his stance on the church through his fantasy world and the Magesterium. He abandons that and the head pounding begins:\"That is what the Church does, and every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling. So if a war comes, and the Church is on one side of it, we must be on the other, no matter what strange allies we find ourselves bound to.\"It was just all a bit too heavy handed for me and it weighed the story down, a story that already missed the high mark set in The Golden Compass.I'll keep reading.

Not that it matters. What matters is that The Subtle Knife is too fast, too plot driven, and too much \"a set-up\" book to be an effective second book in the trilogy. Second books are generally strong because they give the reader a chance to breathe and get to know the characters. Not so in The Subtle Knife. Instead, Pullman introduces new characters, and not just peripheral characters, but Will, a character who seems to be the primary protagonist of His Dark Materials, and Mary, who will create the amber spyglass of the third book. Meanwhile, characters who seemed important in The Golden Compass, Azriel, Iorek and even Lyra are either supporting cast or merely spoken of. Perhaps this would work if the series was longer, if Pullman took more time with his stories, gave us greater detail, but he doesn't. Everything is fast, too fast, and the characters suffer, making it difficult to care about what is happening.The Subtle Knife is definitely a let down after Pullman's quite good The Golden Compass, and I have little hope for The Amber Spyglass, but I will know soon enough since I feel compelled to finish the series.One sidebar: for those who insist on calling this series \"atheist,\" you should understand what atheism is. This series is anti-god, but that means the book MUST NOT be atheist. To be anti-god a story must posit a god, and by assuming the presence of a god (or god-like force) a story cannot be atheist.

We also see small hints of the rebellion that will be raged across the worlds, but more importantly we see the beginnings of Lyra and Will. In Will we see someone who's had responsibility thrust upon them unwillingly, forced to deal with issues far beyond the usual imaginings of a 12 year old boy. In Lyra we see a character who's already seen and done extraordinarily things as a child begin to grow into herself, and learn to follow instead of lead. Its really the perfect bridging novel that The Amber Spyglass needs to develop characters and storylines ready for that all important final chapter.

You have this daemon in you, all of us, just as the story goes. And as a child it is anything, it has the fantastical vision that children have, there is nothing to stop it. But then we mostly grow up and we mostly lose the idea that we can do anything, we lose imagination, we lose the unconscious bravery of our childhood, we lose the intrepidness and curiosity with which we were born. And so our daemon can no longer be anything. It is a static reflection of the settled thing we become as we move into adulthood.

They die because they were fighting for you, or because you couldn't fight hard enough for them, or because they are spurned - there are at least some things your daemon can be that thrive on the nourishment that is given them by others. You can't fight to save it because you can't force people see it the right way. They take away the thing that succoured your daemon and made it and you blossom, you see it lying on the ground, dying, and there is nothing you can do. You can't save it, only other people can.If you think about it, when you read these books, the reason you feel so utterly gutted whenever one of these creatures dies, is because you know what it feels like. You know that what is being described is exactly something dying in you, a process of loss that makes you a lesser person. Grey replaces lit-up, fear replaces joy, a sick pit in your stomach replaces a heart that beat too much from happiness. These things happen and in a heart-beat something infinitely precious is being severed from you. And I feel as helpless in their path as a small child watching something monstrously large taking their daemon away.

We also had Will, who is a new \u2018protagonist\u2019 in a way, in that he seems to be almost as equally as important as Lyra in the story after the end of the book.It\u2019s not really a problem in the sense that it is bad or anything, but rather the fact that I found it a bit strange that for a series that is, I assume targeted towards middle-grade readers due to the age of the two main characters, that there would be so many point of views, so many different story arcs to follow(Dr. Malone, Lee Scoresby, Grumman, just to name a few), not to mention as many have pointed out, there being lots of talk about politics and philosophy, and in this book, lots of science stuff in a fantasy story\u2019s way, which, which I can\u2019t help but think may turn off some readers of the \u2018intended audience.\u2019Aside from my little ramble, I did really like many aspects of the book and found many parts to be incredible fascinating, and loved at how the travelling between world\u2019s happen and we even spent a few good chapters on good ol\u2019 Earth(our Earth that is). The whole thing with the Spectre\u2019s was very creative on Pullman\u2019s behalf and I really do think that he is quite the guy when it comes to creativity and making up mystical and magical things. Quite honestly, the creativity of the book was one of its most alluring points about it and is something that is to be both savoured and remembered.The plot, which was beautifully crafted together felt like one smooth ride without any bumps on it, which in a way, also made it sort of uninteresting from a certain perspective in that nothing really shocking happens, or when it does, the author does not emphasis a great deal on it and instead decided to continue his flow, which was fine since it did work here, so I\u2019m not really one for complaining here.I will be hopeful when reading the conclusion to the His Dark Materials trilogy and hope that Pullman has pulled off a satisfying conclusion that will tie the story to a grand close. 7/10", "num_likes": 21, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2019", "fantasy", "adventure", "children-s-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/20813614", "review_id": "20813614", "date": "Apr 23, 2008", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Brigid \u2729", "user_url": "/user/show/886144-brigid", "text": "So, I'm re-reading this trilogy for the first time in like twelve years! I was curious to see what my stance on it would be after all this time. I remember loving the first book as a kid and then being a little iffy about books two and three ... and well, I think I liked this second installment a bit more as an adult, but I do still feel it's not quite as strong as the first book.There are still a lot of things I love about The Subtle Knife:\u2022 The world-building continues to be very entrancing, especially as it gets more into the concept of multiple universes.\u2022 This book also has the first appearance of the Specters *shudders* which are pretty terrifying.\u2022 I like Will, although I don't think he's quite as endearing as Lyra. But the two of them together make a cute team, and I like that they feel like actual flawed, stubborn twelve-year-old kids. I find some things a little lacking about this book though:\u2022 As the second book in the trilogy, I think it does kind of fall prey to that \"stepping stone\" syndrome where it feels more like a transition between books than anything else. It introduces Will, the multiple worlds, the Specters, etc. etc. but I don't feel like it has much of a self-contained plot. It's a bigger piece of a whole, which is fine and all, but it does feel kind of unsatisfying in some ways. \u2022 I'm still not really sold on the whole anti-religion aspect of the books. I love the world-building, the characters, etc. but when it really gets into the religion/anti-religion I get a little bored. It has some interesting messages on the subject, but it feels very heavy-handed to me and I feel like it could afford to be more subtle. I remember this being the main reason that I was not a huge fan of the second and third books when I was younger, and as an adult I'm still finding it a little annoying. Well anyway! Over all, I still really enjoyed this book and had fun reading it a second time. There are some kind of tedious parts, but in general it's still a very good book and I look forward to re-reading the third one.

This one is MUCH darker which is fine, some of the ideas are complex and has some philosophical ideas which the target audience may struggle with. I had to read some sections a couple of times to see if I\u2019d understood. This one focuses a lot on religion and control and in the case of Lyra\u2019s world the two are one as the religious based Magisterium controls her world. In this one we meet Will who is going to be critical in the war that Lord Asriel is preparing for and in many ways this book feels like the bridge to that grand finale. Will is in the run in his world and he inadvertently finds a door into another world which is a terrifying one with Spectres killing adults. Here though he meets Lyra Silvertongue (Belacqua) and their partnership grows into a good friendship. We learn why Will is so important especially after he acquires the subtle knife which is going to be critical in the upcoming war. The story is told from several perspectives including the witch Serafina Pekkala (I just love that name and am seriously considering a name change) and Will and Lyra. This book is action packed, there are gruesome creatures, there\u2019s the usual evil, treachery and double crossing (yes, of course, Mrs Coulter) several deaths but there also bravery and the continuing search for truth.

I quite enjoy Will, and found him a great counterpart for Lyra. Their personalities are very different, but they are both defined most by the protectiveness that fuels them and the fierceness that courses through them. Will is both more civilized and more violent than Lyra, which shines a softer light on our original protagonist than we saw in her first book. The two children on the cusp of their adolescence are quite obviously being set up as either the salvation or damnation of the countless worlds they now know exist. \u201cIt\u2019s like having to make a choice: a blessing or a curse. The one thing you can\u2019t do is choose neither.\u201d  I enjoyed how Pullman made some of these alternate worlds so similar, with just enough differences to be jarring. The further implications of the importance of d\u00e6mons, whether they be externally expressed or contained within a person, are fascinating, as is the relation of Dust to dark matter in our own world. Even though I enjoyed these philosophical elements, this book felt far more like a thriller than the adventure story found in The Golden Compass. And yet, I also felt this book was a good deal slower, suffering in places from middle-book syndrome. There\u2019s no was that this book could stand well on its own, at least in my opinion. The events of the previous book are absolutely necessary knowledge in order to understand what\u2019s going on in The Subtle Knife, and the cliffhanger ending would have been infuriating had I not been able to immediately pick up the final installment. \u201cI found folly everywhere, but there were grains of wisdom in every stream of it.\u201d Besides the philosophical questions and wonderfully fleshed out child protagonists, my favorite elements of this series are the title objects. The Golden Compass, or aliethiometer, of the first book was a fascinating concept and was so well described that I could almost feel the weight of it in my palms. The namesake of The Subtle Knife is just was intriguing and easy to visualize. I\u2019m already excited to find out the significance of the finale\u2019s title, The Amber Spyglass. As a side note, I was also taken with the adult characters from The Golden Compass who have developed a love for Lyra and determined within themselves to do all they can to stand in for her parents. They\u2019re lovely individuals, and the hard choices they made were so incredibly worthy of respect. \u201cEvery little increase in human freedom has been fought over ferociously between those who want us to know more and be wiser and stronger, and those who want us to obey and be humble and submit.\u201d I didn\u2019t love The Subtle Knife as much as I did its predecessor, but I still enjoyed it and found myself excited to pick up the final installment. While I definitely don\u2019t share the worldview conveyed in this series, I don\u2019t feel at all like Pullman was trying to preach through his trilogy; he\u2019s just telling a good story that feels both vastly different and sometimes similar to series that shaped my childhood. As much as I love Narnia, it\u2019s definitely a series that pushes its worldview, because that was the intention behind its authorship. I\u2019m interested to see how I feel about The Amber Spyglass, and if I can maintain my objectivity in the face of the events that were spoiled for me so many years ago.You can find this review and more at Novel Notions.

I still think it sounds better that way - it gives the word a sort of dull power that I think depicts the mysterious magic of the knife much better than the silly, flippant 'suttle'. Saying 'sub-tle' opens up previously-unimagined worlds which extend indefinitely into the distance. And this is what is good about this series. I've come up with a list of the main qualities that stand out in the fantasy books I enjoy, which is as follows:1. Engaging, complex characters combined with a realistic, convincing plot.2. A tragedy so heart-rending that it is somehow beautiful.3. An intriguing world.The fantasy books I have enjoyed most over the years all seem to have at least one of these characteristics. The first point, obviously, is not unique to fantasy, but I had to include it because there are a few fantasy books that I have read where magic and so on are fairly irrelevant. They are not the centre of the plot; you get the impression they were included simply because the author wanted to give themselves a different set of specifications, as a challenge perhaps, or maybe they felt bored or limited by the confines of reality. Example of this kind of book include anything by Diana Wynne Jones, as well as Robin Hobb's Assassins trilogy, which doesn't have either of the other two qualities, though the Liveship Traders trilogy that follows it has plenty of the third point.The second point relates to books whose denouement hinges on an event so sad that it is unutterably perfect, and you knew it could never be any other way. It was so sad that it was beautiful and the reason you cried was as much for that beauty as for the tragedy. The main books I can think of that have this quality are Cecilia Dart-Thornton's Bitterbynde trilogy and Sheri S. Tepper's Beauty, and there was another one by Juliet Marillier (I think). A disproportionate amount of Celtic mythology in there, anyway. But: I haven't read any of these books for years, so it's quite possible that my obsession with their tragedy was just a product of adolescent romanticism. But anyway.The third point is, I believe, the most important for fantasy. Books that are set in the equivalent of a medieval England with magic would be boring if that was all there was to it, so they have to have at least one of the other two points to be a good book. The truly great fantasy books are the ones that make you want to know more about the world in which they are set. A single novel is really quite a small number of words to depict an entire world, and I hope no author would be stupid enough to try it. The ones who really have talent can suggest, though, in just a few chapters, enough to inspire a fascination in you that will never leave. The word 'intriguing' is nowhere near strong enough to describe it. Garth Nix's Abhorsen trilogy is one of these, and Susannah Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is the queen of them all, and probably my favourite fantasy book.His Dark Materials is a book of the third point, though it has elements of the first and second points too. Pullman's genius is to create a world that is very similar to ours, and then say that in fact there are infinite numbers of other worlds that are also very similar to ours, and that they all overlay each other, and that it is possible to travel between them. The contrasts between the different worlds allow him to make much of all sorts of different ways of looking at something. It's important to note that no one in these books ever thinks of what they are doing as magic - it is science, or it is religion. It is theoretical physics and experimental theology. The lines between science and religion and magic, three things that are not supposed to intersect, are blurred beyond all recognition.It's not badly written, but the best thing you can say of the prose is that it never distracts, which in this case is perfect. And of course, the characters are all right. Will and Lyra are cool, but despite their so-called 'flaws' they're also brave and good and perfect in a rather boring way. The villains aren't bad, and I like the way there are groups of characters, such as the bears and the witches, whose societies work differently to ours and who think differently to us and who do things differently as a result. The clashes between these different ways of thought (such as the one that leads to the death of Jopari (attempting to avoid spoilers)) are very well done. But nothing is really out of the ordinary.Most important, though, are the daemons. I don't think it does anything special character-wise - it's not a radically new way of creating personality or anything - but it does have a lot of tragic potential (think Lee Scoresby and Hester in the ravine, trying to call Serafina Pekkala to save them), and it is a crucial part of what makes the world so intriguing. That one's soul can live outside of oneself is something, and that this soul can then be separated from oneself is something else. That this soul can be eaten by strange spectral beings, whether within the body or without, is another thing again. That there is a mysterious substance that is attracted to this soul, and that this strange attraction varies according to the age of a person, that is brilliant.I think what I like about Pullman is that he takes his ideas much further than would occur to most other people. And somehow you can sense, like the alethiometers' invisible layers of meaning extending down to negative infinity, that the ideas ramify back endlessly too, and all you have to do is think about it and you can get there.

He belongs to 'our' world, not the one Lyra lives in, but soon the two children will meet, because they are destined to. Will is a troubled child. Unlike Lyra who is an emotional orphan (she has parents who care nothing for her), Will has a mother. Unfortunately, Will's mother happens to be mentally ill. Since he realized that, Will has been forced to grow up quickly and learn how to both take care of his mother and hide it before others, so that she wouldn't be put in an institution. His father has been missing since forever, and the boy dreams of finding him, especially since some nasty people turn out, torturing his mother with questions about his father. Will is forced to hide his mother and flee. He finds the door to another world where he founds Lyra as well. A world haunted by Spectres, who eat adults but leave the children alone. When Lyra consults her device, it tells her that Will is a murderer, and she feels reassured because...? I don't get it. Is she is in some kind of shook? The first novel ended with the murder of her dear friend, so why would Lyra feel reassured that someone she meets is a murderer? I liked Will and I sympathized with him, but it is an understatement to say that he stole the spotlight from Lyra. This whole novel could have happened without her, that's how big the role she plays. For most part, Lyra turns into less than a sidekick. Alright, Lyra does make some research into Dust ( which in our world is known as dark matter), and this meets this scientist Mary, an ex nun, so there is a parallel plot but I can't tell yet how strong that one might be since it is all left hanging at the end. Witches also make another appearance, and this is what disappointed me the most. The author has the chance to teach us more about them, but he totally missed it. I was happy when Serafina appeared again, but soon I was left wanting. She is supposed to be this wise and fierce witch queen, but she seems awfully indecisive. I rolled my eyes at her not being able to glance at Will's eyes for fear of him. Moreover, there is another witch queen Leta who is head over heels with Lyra's father. It seems that witches hate Mrs. Coutlier because of what she did to children in the first novel, but they don't hate the child murderer that is Lyra's father- why, is it because he is a guy? If they are so ready to stand on the side of everyone who is against the maker and the church, why haven't be told so before? All the female characters in this one seem to be portrayed as being very weak and needing the men to come to their rescue. The only exception being Lyra's wicked mother. How disappointing! What is more, Lyra as a character didn't seem nearly as alive as she did in the first book. To be frank, I was a bit disappointed by this one. It seems that author is more interested in making himself sound smart, than in actually telling the story. The wold building felt messy. I loved the first book in this series, my only complaint being that it wasn't really suitable for young children, but that's fine because I think it was originally intended more for YA audience. Nevertheless, I was impressed with Northern Lights and the world Pullman created. However, I found this second one lacking in many ways. Nothing is really explained in terms of theology, the author just keeps adding new ideas, events and worlds. What bothered me the most? Maybe Lyra- the protagonist of the first book. Lyra is there but is like the Spectres got her, she doesn't have any life in her. She turns into a damsel in distress who desperately tried to please Will. Does that sound like Lyra from the first book? I mean I could have bought it if Lyra has been a little less desperate. It was lovely seeing these two kids form a bond, but I wish it was a more even relationship between them. I don't know, maybe I was expecting too much, but I didn't get much satisfaction from The Subtle Knife. The story about Will's father started off interesting, but I didn't like how it developed. The same goes for the other parallel plots. Quite disappointing.

It was clear that the Philip Pullman had an active imagination and was good at constructing his worlds just as any good fantasy author.That's one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy this volume as much as the first one. As it was stated that the books will take place in several universes, I hoped that each of them will be as richly drawn as the first one. It wasn't. Most of the elements that made Northern Lights so enjoyable (the Gyptians, the panserbj\u00f6rne - the armored polar bears, how can something be more awesome?) are all dropped and nothing equally interesting is introduced in their place. The world-building comes to a halt, and it doesn't help the series.Lyra Belacqua, the brave and cocky protagonist all but disappears and takes a supporting role to Will Parry, a 12 year old boy who takes the lead. Thanks to a happy coincidence their worlds meet, and the two form a team.Lyra (who was so proud and morally independent in the first installment) becomes subservient almost immediately after their meeting, because she learns through her Alethiometer that the boy is a murderer. Oddly, this makes Lyra feel safe - why she doesn't suspect that the boy might hurt her is never entirely clear. Gone is too the intimate connection between Lyra and her Daemon, which allowed us to see her own inner doubts and disagreements. Pantalaimon plays a minor role in this installment, and all he has to say are a few lines of unrevealing dialogue which adds absolutely nothing to the plot and the characters.The Alethiometer, which helped Lyra achieve her goals in the first volume, now almost seems to set them. It's eerily reminiscent of a certain notebook from another well known franchise. You must excuse this rather poor pun, but the novel is far from subtle. All of the moral complexity and religious questioning from Northern Lights is dropped, and there's no longer any doubt about what Dust might be, or what are Lord Arsiel's and Mrs. Coulter's intentions. It seems as if Pullman came up with well-crafed fantasy in the first volume and then decided to toss in some anti-religous content just for the pure sake of doing so. He doesn't bring up any sort of polemic or interesting, challenging questions which would make reader think about what he has to say. It's not intelectually stimulating in any way, especially considering that the series is aimed at younger readers - his absolute lack of subtlety and metaphor doesn't allow for any doubt about his belief. You can't ask a child \"what do you think is the author's stance on the Authority, the Magisterium? Do you think he's right? Do you think he's wrong?\" because of the obviousness of the answer. Look at this:\"I know whom we must fight. It is the Magisterium, the Church. For all its history\u2013 and that's not long by our lives, but it's many, many of theirs\u2013it's tried to suppress and control every natural impulse.\"\"That is what the Church does, and every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling. So if a war comes, and the Church is on one side of it, we must be on the other, no matter what strange allies we find ourselves bound to.\"\"\"Oh, there is more suffering to come. We have a thousand years of experience in this Church of ours. We can draw out your suffering endlessly.\"That's pretty much a good summary of how the book tackles the issues. One would expect somewhat more subtlety, grace and thought would be put into questioning them, being as big as they are. Unfortunately that's not the case here.Lyra and Will's adventures are rather dull and boring, and the characters seem to be unchanged by the experience. The whole thing feels cold and calculated, as if the author changed his mind about letting children discuss and discover the benefits and danger of religion on their own. Instead, he chose to throw in his real-life opinions at them with the arfullness of throwing a brick into someone's face. The whole thing feels cold and calculated, and never recaptures the feel of the first installment.

I find him more likable than most of the other characters, including Lyra, but that's not saying very much. I just don't like most of the characters. I still also don't get how this is a book for children. It seems to value lying and murder among other questionable attributes. It's one thing not to pull punches with children, but this is something else.Maybe I'm just too old or cynical. I also could have done without the mini-rant about religion. It just seemed unnecessary. I get that some of the characters are anti-religion. The rant really took me out of the story and I feel like it could have been left out without losing anything.That aside, I found this one better than the first. I liked the stuff with multiple worlds a lot. Also, while the subtle knife seems like yet another plot device (may as well be a sonic screwdriver), it does add an interesting element to the story. When combined with the Alethiometer, it helps to add to the sense of fantasy to what could almost be a science fiction novel otherwise.I wish I enjoyed this series more than I do. I was hoping this would be in the realm of Harry Potter. A lot of people seem to really enjoy this series. I just think it's OK.

This second book is very different than the previous one, it's much more philosophical and political, and follows multiple perspectives. Some of those perspectives I enjoyed because I like the characters, some less. The witches' perspective, for example, was just boring for me (which it's kinda weird, i mean how can witches be boring, especially if one is Latvian??). One of the characters this book introduces though, Mary Malone, is actually my favourite in the whole series, so I was very excited when she appeared.I also don't remember much about this book from the first time I read it, compared to the other two; and I think the main reason for this is its incoherence in pace, topics and tone: it's neither action-oriented neither thought-oriented, and even though it follows many perspectives it's not character oriented. I think it's a little bit of a mess, to be honest.Still, some of these chapters have been stunning, and I remember that one of the reasons I was so fascinated by this series when I was a kid (and also one of the reasons I sometimes can't enjoy modern ya) is the complex philosophy behind it. When I first read it I was in that particular moment of one's life when you are just starting to understand what philosophy, spirituality and religion really mean and trying to find your place within them. I think this book had a part in shaping how I think today, so I still consider it important even though I struggled a little with it this second time.

Lyra has crossed the bridge between the worlds at the end of the last book and landed in a city of another where there are no adults, apparently because of specters. Shortly later she meets Will, who has had it hard in his very own way what with his sick mother and missing father. For some reason, the alethiometer tells Lyra to help him find his father.Through Will, Lyra also gets to Will's world where she meets a physicist (studying what is known to Lyra as dust) and a man oddly familiar to her (though she cannot place him for a long time) and is thus sent on another quest, this time to retrieve the titular knife.In this new volume we learn of the string of worlds, people going back and forth, what happens to the party of friends Lyra left behind (Lee, Serafina ...) but also to the old enemies like Mrs. Coulter and the Magisterium (the Authority). Moreover, this sort of opens up many more elements of this story as the trilogy seems to be about so much more than what we brushed upon in the first book. As the multiverse opens up to Lyra, so does the narrative open to the reader.A friend and buddy-reader, Vero, also pointed out the inspiration the author got from Paradise Lost and it's true. I haven't read that other book but heard about it and the story it tells; the exciting story of innocence vs corruption, as well as rebellion and betrayal - all motives that are certainly present in Pullman's book(s) too. It's interesting to see the parallels as well as what he did differently and to guess why. And he's constantly playing with expectations and perceptions.At first it was a bit strange to read about (view spoiler)[angels and Asriel (I always expected his name to be spelled Azrael) wanting to fight the fight with them against Heaven or Mrs. Coulter\u2018s power over others (hide spoiler)] but I really don't know why as I didn't have a problem with the (view spoiler)[daemons, witches, the magic that makes the alethiometer work (before we got the explanation) etc (hide spoiler)]. However, especially after taking into consideration the afore-mentioned influence of Milton, it did indeed make sense and not really bother me much. As a middle book this was very thrilling and full of information - something most middle books don't manage so I was pleased immensely. The writing style is as fluent and approachable as ever, the characters lively and distinct and I especially like how such a fantastical story, at its core, tells of profoundly simple concepts (such as growing up) by making us accompany not special creatures but \"just children\" ((view spoiler)[for no matter what role Lyra will have to play, she doesn\u2018t have powers, not really, she\u2018s just thrust into situation after situation, trying to rise to the occasion, to do the right thing (hide spoiler)]). If one doesn't pay attention, subtle hints and elements can easily be overlooked/overheard, that's how rich Pullman's creation is.Not to mention the emotional blows the author dealt in this. His writing was always vivid and one cared a lot about the characters which made one be so shocked about the betrayal of Lyra's parents at the end of the first book as well as the fate of her poor friend Roger. However, it really hurt to read of (view spoiler)[Lee's sacrifice. I saw it coming when he helped the shaman that I knew to be Will's father early on, but I still gripped whatever I could find and tried to change the outcome by sheer force of will, because that old man was so kind and brave and good - just like his tough and wonderful daemon Hester (hide spoiler)]. *cries* And even (view spoiler)[Will's father, whom we hadn't known all THAT well, was a faithful character (saying No to a beautiful witch because he had a wife and son at home even though he knew he would probably never be able to get back to them) that made reading about his death the moment he realized who Will (hide spoiler)] was so sad!I'm glad we're buddy-reading the whole trilogy one book after another because I'm really at the edge of my seat now and want to know where the author is taking this. I do have my theories, of course, but I can't be sure.As for this audio version, I can only say that it was almost as good as the first. Almost because the beginnings of the chapters had musical intros that were a bit too loud so one could hardly understand the chapter\u2018s title.

In my review a few days ago, I wrote that I was incredibly grateful I decided to reread the series, allowing the opportunity to discover the magic that is the His Dark Materials series. What I didn't think could be possible was that \nThe Subtle Knife\n would increase this feeling so significantly. My memory of this book in the overall series was that I had not particularly enjoyed it, but it has become my absolute favourite this time around. \n \"Tirelessly they flew on and on, and tirelessly she kept pace. She felt a fierce joy possessing her, that she could command these immortal presences. And she rejoiced in her blood and flesh, in the rough pine bark she felt next to her skin, in the beat of her heart and the life of all her senses, and in the hunger she was feeling now, and in the presence of her sweet-voiced bluethroat d\u00e6mon, and in the earth below her and the lives of every creature, plant and animal both; and she delighted in being of the same substance as them, and in knowing that when she died her flesh would nourish other lives as they had nourished her.\" \nThe introduction of new characters and new worlds in \nThe Subtle Knife\n is done with an expert touch. Philip Pullman manages to include an insane amount of exposition in an incredibly natural way. There is so much information about Dust, travelling between worlds, Lyra's prophecy, the Authority, and, well, everything, but it never distracts from the story. And it's such a good story.\n \"The fact was that where Will was concerned, she was developing a new kind of sense, as if he were simply more in focus than anyone she'd known before. Everything about him was clear and close and immediate.\" \nWill's story is heartbreaking; he's so strong and independent for such terrible reasons. He knows how to fend for himself and take care of others, which, luckily, is exactly what Lyra needs. Lyra is outstanding if you need to run in blindly and lie your way into (or out of) something, but when it comes to planning and subtlety (and competence), you want Will on your side. They complement each other perfectly, and despite their differences, they certainly have similarities. They both have terrible histories stemming from their parents, and neither seems to have the possibility of a happy ending in sight.\"She tiptoed to the window. In the glow from the streetlight she carefully set the hands of the alethiometer, and relaxed her mind into the shape of a question. The needle began to sweep around the dial in a series of pauses and swings almost too fast to watch.She had asked: What is he? A friend or an enemy?The alethiometer answered: He is a murderer.When she saw the answer, she relaxed at once. He could find food, and show her how to reach Oxford, and those were powers that were useful, but he might still have been untrustworthy or cowardly. A murderer was a worthy companion. She felt as safe with him as she'd felt with Iorek Byrnison, the armored bear.\" As a retelling of a pretty essential biblical story, \nThe Subtle Knife\n stays true to the history of religion with a lot of sadness and sacrifice. There are so many adults and organisations believing so strongly in their vision or faith that they are willing to force their beliefs on the rest of the world at any cost.\n\" 'There are two great powers,' the man said, 'and they've been fighting since time began. Every advance in human life, every scrap of knowledge and wisdom and decency we have has been torn by one side from the teeth of the other. Every little increase in human freedom has been fought over ferociously between those who want us to know more and be wiser and stronger, and those who want us to obey and be humble and submit.'\" \nI've forgotten most of what happens in \nThe Amber Spyglass\n, but I remember it being fairly dense. Then again, I didn't remember liking \nNorthern Lights\n and especially \nThe Subtle Knife\n, which seems crazy to me at this point. I have thoroughly enjoyed rereading this series so far, and it's a nice reminder that not all first impressions are accurate.\n \"She felt a nausea of the soul, a hideous and sickening despair, a melancholy weariness so profound that she was going to die of it. Her last conscious thought was disgust at life; her senses had lied to her. The world was not made of energy and delight but of foulness, betrayal, and lassitude. Living was hateful, and death was no better, and from end to end of the universe this was the first and last and only truth.\" \nReview originally posted here on Britt's Book Blurbs.Other books in the His Dark Materials series:#0.5: \nOnce Upon a Time in the North\n \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50#0.6: \nThe Collectors\n \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50#1: \nNorthern Lights\n \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50#3: \nThe Amber Spyglass\n \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50#3.5: \nLyra's Oxford\n \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50#3.6: \nSerpentine\n \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\nBlog | Bookstagram | Reddit | Twitter\n", "num_likes": 13, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fiction", "religion", "rating-five-stars", "adventure", "fantasy", "age-demographics-middle-grade", "religion-christianity", "sci-fi-steampunk", "lit-retelling", "fantasy-angels"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3925909142", "review_id": "3925909142", "date": "May 04, 2021", "rating": 4, "user_name": "enqi \u2661 (taylor's version)", "user_url": "/user/show/41427900-enqi-taylor-s-version", "text": "This second instalment mainly focuses on the other titular character in the series \u2013 Will Parry.

When Moonlight finishes her reviews I will add links here so you can read them. Looks like we finally got some good book mojo our way. Spoilers for those who have not read The Golden Compass.So after the events of the last book, where Lyra now calling herself Lyra Silvertongue has found out that her father is Lord Asriel and her mother is Mrs. Coulter. Lord Asriel has killed her best friend Roger and used that death to punch a doorway into another world. Lord Asriel has plans to take down \"death\" itself. Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon have decided to follow Lord Asriel and do whatever is necessary to stop him.Seriously though. Lyra has the worst parents ever. Your heart breaks for her and you realize how brave she is in order to do what is necessary to stop Lord Asriel after her inadvertent treachery led to Lord Asriel's bigger treachery. Now book two begins in our world.A young boy named Will doing his best to hide his mother while he goes looking for his missing father. Some strange men keep coming to Will's house and asking for something that they think his father may have sent to them. Will manages to find a hidden opening and walks into another world and finds Lyra. Joining up, the two children realize that they need one another in order to do what the alethiometer tells Lyra she must do, which is find Will's father with him. The character of Will won my heart. That kid had sheer bravery in the face of extreme odds. Lyra likens him to Iorek Brynison and he really is like him and also just like him gets Lyra to stop and think before she jumps in head first to take people on. Lyra matures throughout book two. She realizes that she needs to be more careful of what she does without thinking it through because it can mean Will's death. In Lyra's head the worst thing to do would be to betray or lose him, she truly loves him and he becomes her best friend. We have secondary characters who are no less important like Serafina Pekkala who is a straight up boss in this book. I shudder for Mrs. Coulter because Serafina is all about making sure all debts are owed in the end. Also we get more points of view by Lee Scoresby who just like Serafina, loves Lyra for her own sake and will do what is necessary to take care of her.(view spoiler)[I don't know if I can forgive Phillip Pullman for what happened to this character. I started crying. It was straight up heart wrenching.  (hide spoiler)]We also get some new big bads in this book and the reappearance of Mrs. Coulter and her horrible golden monkey.

Wow I have gotten quite blood thirsty reading these books.The writing was fantastic. I once again have to give Phillip Pullman kudos for how he incorporated religious symbols and other stories from the Bible in this book. We have a discussion of angels and of Dust and Dark Matter. I really think it was smartly done. The pacing was perfect too. I was holding my breath up until the very last pages. And the book ending on a cliffhanger gave me a momentary feeling of WTF but I quickly got over it since I now I am reading book three on Friday.The setting of the different worlds was great. I can't wait to read more about the bearer of the knife, spectres, and daemons. I felt like I was right there with Lyra and Will and I now more than ever wish that the movies would have done the first book justice. I swear these days unless it's on t.v. people don't take their time with stories like this. The ending like I said is quite a cliffhanger.

According to Pullman, our proper end is to fight alongside the rebel angels, our makers, against the Authority, the god of the twisted Magisterium.I can't help but admire Pullman's boldness in so explicitly laying out his philosophy. It reminds me very much of the opening paragraphs of God and the State, in which Mikhail Bakunin rather brilliantly inverts the biblical story of original sin and refers to Satan as \"the first freethinker, the emancipator of worlds.\"", "num_likes": 12, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2091973935", "review_id": "2091973935", "date": "Aug 15, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Snooty1", "user_url": "/user/show/56024443-snooty1", "text": " Seems to me, the place is you fight cruelty is where you find it, and the place you give help is where you see it needed. --Lee Scoresby-- Holy hell!

I was sooooo excited when Beastmaster 2 and Masters of the Universe came out in theaters, and I begged my parents to take me to see them. And you want to know what completely ruined those two movies? Well, they took something I loved out of its setting (part of why I loved them) and, instead, put them in our present day. BOOOOOOOOORING!!!! Not to mention incredibly lazy on the part of the filmmakers. Ever since then, the quickest way a work of fantasy can alienate me is to leave behind whatever awesome world it's set in... for our boring, lameass world. And that is exactly what happens in The Subtle Knife. I'm reading fantasy books for fantasy things in fantastical worlds, not to read about downtown London in the 1990s. Whoopie. What a fun setting after leaving behind a really cool and magical world full of mystery and wonder. NOT!!! Luckily not much time is spent in our world, but enough for me to knock a star off the rating for it. The other thing that really annoyed me about this book is that the first book was told almost entirely from the point of view of Lyra, my favorite character by far in the series. She was the center of all the action, using her street smarts to outwit her enemies, journeying to strange and mysterious places where few people had ever gone before, learning to use a magical device to divine truth all on her own. And the vast majority of this book doesn't even focus on her at all. There is very little of it from her point of view, and pretty much all of that awesomeness she displayed in the first book has been stripped away from her, making her seem rather weak and incompetent, while some new character takes center stage in her place. (view spoiler)[She even gets kidnapped at the end and the boy runs off to save her. Dammit Pullman, she doesn't need saving, Book 1 Lyra would have talked her way free five minutes after being captured!!!  (hide spoiler)]I still enjoyed the book, but not nearly as much as the first one. I do find Lord Asriel's building up a huge fortress and massive army to wage war against the heavens to be rather interesting, if a little over the top. And I really liked the idea of a world where all the adults are attacked by Specters too. I only wish Pullman had really brought us into that world and made it more a part of the story, rather than it feeling more like a stage prop background that was just sort of there behind the characters while they talked a few times, and never really shone on its own. It feels like a really big missed opportunity to me. Although it did do a pretty good job of illustrating how one person's Eden, can be another person's hell.This book is probably a necessary step along the progression of the story, but it's nowhere near as fun, imaginative, or awesome as the first book. It really pales in comparison. It's also not written nearly as well as the first book was. Which is where the other star got knocked off. The first book was beautifully described, and Lyra felt and acted like an actual person. The descriptions in this book were rather bland and stereotypical, and Lyra doesn't seem to have even half the personality she had in the first book. And the other kids don't really act like kids either. That was one of the most amazing things about the first book, all of the kids actually acted, talked, and thought like real kids. Here it's more like they're acting like an adult thinks kids should act, which is not the same thing at all. Also, put away the soapbox, Pullman. We get it, you're an atheist. That might have been news 200 years ago, but the world has moved on (see what I did thar), and no one cares anymore. You can talk about something else already. You're starting to sound like Terry Goodkind when someone accidentally mentions morality in his hearing. It kind of seemed like a lot of this book was simply the author declaring to the world that he doesn't believe in God and Organized religion is evil. Whereas in the first book, it was all very subtly woven into the story and only became very blatant at the very end. I find it rather amusing that a book with the word \"subtle\" in the title is very much not subtle at all. The first book was a masterful work of fantasy, bringing up a strange and mysterious world, new and original ideas, and extraordinarily well written and likeable characters. This one is kind of a bland mess of equal parts preaching the evils of organized religion, and the author waffling about like he forgot what this part of the story was supposed to be about. While it's his right to share his opinion with others, and I even agree with him that organized religion hasn't exactly had the greatest track record with holding to their own supposed beliefs *cough*Crusades,Spanish Inquisition,Salem Witch Hunts*cough*, however it does get a little old after about the billionth time he brings it up. Remember when this was a fantasy book for children? It seems that the author is more interested in sharing his beliefs than telling a story sometimes, which gets frustrating to me as someone trying to enjoy the story, which keeps getting interrupted so that the author can give another sermon. For someone who doesn't believe in God, he sure does like to preach. Just sayin'.It almost seems as though Pullman wrote this book first, and then realized he needed a better foundation for the story, and went back to write the first book to prop it up. It would explain the shift in protagonists, the poorer quality of the writing, and the far less subtle touch he used with his anti-religious elements in this one.", "num_likes": 11, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1969079697", "review_id": "1969079697", "date": "Apr 29, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Amy Norris", "user_url": "/user/show/21715891-amy-norris", "text": "So much has already been said about this wonderful series so I will keep this review short.

I ran across it in the library one day, years after I read the first one. I loved the whole parallel universes jag, and it was undercut with this darkness most of my reading material lacked, but that I found fascinating. I also loved Will (and still do), and remain fascinated with the idea of the subtle knife, and the price paid to wield it. But I will admit on this read-through that this book is definitely the weakest of the series. As a part of a larger story, it's great, but as its own thing, it's somewhat lacking. It just doesn't have as strong of an arc as the first book, and the \"plot\" is scattered across multiple narrators, which dilutes the experience a little. If we had only followed Will, though, we would have missed out on most of the book, so I get why he did it that way.Thematically, Pullman continues to obsess over authority and parental figures. We learn here that Lord Asriel's plan is to go up against the creator himself, whom they call the Authority, so that's obviously the big instance here. I can't remember why he wants to do this, and it's not elaborated on here, but the center of this one is actually Will and his relationship with his parents: His mother, who he has to take care of, and his father, who he doesn't remember, and has to find in order to \"take up his mantle.\" Pullman consistently sets good parents (or lacking or missing ones) up against ones who abuse their authority and responsibility, like Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel. Pseudo-parental figures pop up everywhere, from Lee Scoresby (who says he views Lyra as a daughter) to Serafina Pekkala, even to the men and women in the Specter-haunted world of Cittagaze, whose children descend into violence without someone to protect them and care for them.All in all, still a good read, I just wish it had been fleshed out a little bit more, and this felt a little bit less like a transition book and more like a full story in its own right.", "num_likes": 9, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["steampunk", "fantasy", "anglophilia", "treasure-and-adventure", "kid-lit", "bildungsroman", "you-wrote-about-what-now", "award-winners", "welcome-to-the-multiverse"]}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/158082287", "review_id": "158082287", "date": "Apr 01, 2011", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Andreea", "user_url": "/user/show/1245700-andreea", "text": "It gets progressively worse as the need to hit the reader of the head with the fact that religion is evil becomes greater than that of telling an actual story.

Why is Reformation completely unheard of in Lyra's world? I'll tell you why, because even a shadow of sense would've destroyed the 'religion is the absolute evil' theory that Pullman feels the need to implant in our brains.

I enjoyed it just as much during this re-read. However, I now realise, while The Golden Compass (Or The Northern Lights to me!) was a very individual book. Subtle Knife and Amber Spyglass kind of blend together. The first book in this series is really Lyra's story. The remaining two books are Lyra and Will's story.Quick free plug time! If you like fantasy that's a bit different, take a look at my The Last Dragon Slayer it's the first in a series and people generally seem to really enjoy it. Onto the Subtle Knife. I recalled this as my favourite book of this trilogy. However having finished it, I've realised bits of the book I remember fondly, are actually in The Amber Spy Glass. Such as the land of the dead bit and Lyra's separation from Pantalaimon. I always associate Mary Malone and those weird elephant people with wheels on their feet as being 'Amber Spy Glass' but there's clearly a LOT more going on in that book. At the end of this re-read, I was left with a feeling that it was a middle episode of a series - which is maybe appropriate. Northern Lights/Golden Compass stood as a novel in it's own right. I think reading on from there, is optional and that maybe explains why they only made one film of this trilogy. I think it would be very hard to reach the end of the Subtle Knife and give up. It ends very much in media res and on something of a cliff-hangar.The start of this story is about how Will meets Lyra. She's in a world which is neither Will's nor hers. If anything Cittigazze seems like a hub world where people can traverse to multiple universes from one point. Obviously Lyra and Will arrive there through different means. I found the whole mythos of the spectre orphans and the abandoned city fascinating on the first read and it was no different this time. We also revisited the witches and the Oblation Board or Gobblers fairly early on. The Gobblers torturing a witch for information, until Serafina Pekkala intervenes. When you're in Cittigazze, you get a real, but strange sense of danger from the spectres. They're harmless and invisible to children, but deadly to adults. The children of Cittigazze to put it bluntly are nasty pieces of work. Think 'Lord of the Flies' nasty, but then you'd expect them to be. They're spectre orphans, their parents effectively killed by the spectres. When later in the book they try and kill Lyra and Will though, I empathise with them. They know adulthood is coming and fear it. When Lyra and Will take the Subtle Knife from Tullio, it's understandable that his sister hates them. She rightly blames them for her brother succumbing to the spectres. Yes, yes, I know he stole it from the previous knife-bearer. That doesn't matter. Lyra and Will came from another world and took the only thing that could defend against the spectres.Before that happens, Will takes Lyra on a sojourn to his own world. It's a great section, because it shows Lyra - so streetwise and cunning in her own word, out of sorts and having to adapt. Our world seems strange indeed to Lyra, but her resourcefulness and talent for deception are universal skills and she DOES find her feet. Mary Malone's digital equivalent of the Alethiometer was interesting too. As a character I didn't bond with Mary on the first run through, but she plays a bigger part in the next book and I enjoyed her communication with the Dust and her following the Dust's instructions.I recalled the gentleman being from Lyra's world, but I'd totally forgotten that he was Lord Boreal from the cocktail party in Mrs. Coulter's flat! He's a nasty piece of work, there's no two ways about it. Would he have given Lyra the Alethiometer if Will had given him the Subtle Knife? I don't think so. The way Will and Lyra stole the Alethiometer back was clever, and it also exposed a weakness of the Subtle Knife which Will and Lyra probably hadn't thought of before, in that if they cut a window in a high floor of a tall building - they can end up forty feet in the air with nothing to stand on. The way they escaped the murderous kids of Cittigazze was cool. I'd forgotten that.I'd also forgotten how problematic Will's wound was. It was pretty gross losing two fingers, but the storyline about his wound not healing seems a bit off. Why? If he WAS destined to be the Knife Bearer, surely he shouldn't have been destined to die of blood loss?Of course while all this is going on Lee Scoresby is searching for Stannislaus Grumnan. I soon started to recall WHO he was, even before the reveal. When the reveal came - it was satisfying. What wasn't satisfying was the final interaction of the novel between the witch, Stannislaus and Will. I thought that was really harsh. Pullman certainly didn't pull any punches there. Will has definitely had a very rough ride in this book. However he's painted as a character who can take difficulties in his stride and that comes across well. Lyra and Will together, given their individual personalities and skills are are a formidable pair.Lee Scoresby and Stannislaus ongoing battle with what I assume are the Oblation board was satisfying. Even though Lee got a pretty raw deal out of it. Having said that, I thought he didn't get so raw a deal as the witch who set out to assassinate Mrs Coulter. Mrs Coulter is I think THE most evil character in this book and probably this series. She's also almost implausibly powerful. I don't buy her being able to control the spectres and give them the power of flight. She's quickly becoming another Knight William or Tom builder's son Alfred from The Pillars of the Earth. Characters who are just so plain nasty you can't wait to read about them being killed. I can't actually remember at this point if Mrs Coulter gets killed. I'll be honest I'm hoping she does! I actually bought Stannislaus's shamanic powers better than Mrs Coulter controlling the spectres. At least that made sense!Quibbles aside, I loved this book. I loved it the first time I read it a few years ago and I loved it just as much this time. It's a really well written tale, which is beautifully complex in it's narrative, but easy to read and filled with a nice ebb and flow of intriguing and high-tension action scenes. Lyra, is even MORE interesting as a character in this book and Will is actually an even MORE interesting character she is! As a pair they are brilliant to follow around and the style of the writing makes you feel like you're there with them - sharing the adventure.I'm re-reading this trilogy in preparation for reading 'La Belle Sauvage which I got for christmas. I'm really glad I decided to take the time to read the entire series. This is a really rich and interesting trilogy. It's innovative, it's bold and it has some very tense and very emotional scenes. Everything you want from this sort of book really.

A friend or an enemy?The alethiometer answered: He is a murderer.When she saw the answer, she relaxed at once.\u201dI was looking forward to jumping back into this series for a while and it did not disappoint! I started a little bit hesitant as my biggest concern with the previous entry was a prolonged slow introduction before getting in the thick of things. This issue was eliminated in The Subtle Knife and things got off to a pretty hectic start from the get-go. In fact, one of the things I liked best about this novel was that it always kept on moving. There was always something interesting going on and the author swapped POVs at the right moments to keep me hooked. The second book introduces a new protagonist - Will - to us and he is immediately likable. We have clear suspense and I always wanted to learn more about him. He fit in with the existing cast extremely well and offered a different look on the world that enhanced other protagonists and their worldviews. In addition to Will, my other favorite PoV was probably from Lee Scoresby. I liked his arc overall and thought it was very well done. In fact, I thought that for pretty much all of our characters since I was always invested in their story. Daemons continue to be as awesome as they always have. Plot-wise the book just gets more and more fantastical which is probably where the book feels at its most natural. Outlandish things just seem to fit in the universe and I was really impressed by all the different creatures and factions that were presented to us. The existence of the artifacts the books are named after is awesome and I always wanted to find out more about them. The added aspects of moving from world to world really improved the novel compared to the first one as well as things were always kept fresh. \u201cI found folly everywhere, but there were grains of wisdom in every stream of it.\u201dThe only thing that I could point out that I was not sold on was the fact that the main bad guys (\"The Magisterium\" or well Church given that Pullman really spells it out for the reader) have a laughable motivation. They almost seem evil just because the author wanted someone evil. I would have taken most explanations like power and greed but they are specifically after this weird substance called \"Dust\" that is not that well explained but used as the catalyst and rationale for all the organizations' bad deeds. The traditional Good vs. Evil thing I would be totally cool with but if the author tries to insert exact reasoning and it is not up to par then the entire thing tumbles over a bit. Luckily this impacted my liking of this specific novel surprisingly little since this was more of a backdrop to everything that was actually going on and I was super invested in the personal challenges that the protagonists had to go through. I can totally see this affecting the final novel though as it looks like a conflict between the sides will become a major focus and more in my view. -------------------------I just wanted to point out one of the funniest things about this novel - namely people often talk about this as being a highly allegorical piece of fiction that somewhat preaches the author's morals. Now I am totally fine with the subject matter in question but I call to attention that allegory is usually supposed to be something containing hidden meaning. Keeping that in mind I present to you the following quote from the book: \"I know whom we must fight...it is the Church. For all its history, it's tried to suppress and control every natural impulse. That is what the Church does, and every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\"Hidden in plain sight indeed.

While it isn't clear what Will's ethnic heritage might be, the text is clear that he has black eyebrows. Straight black brows.That is, however, the only thing about it I dislike. We've changed from the steampunk fantasy world (armored talking bears!) that Lyra is from, to our own world in the present. There is something wrong with Will's mother, and his father has been missing his whole life. Suddenly there are strange men harassing his mother and searching for something, and it all goes pear-shaped very quickly. Fortunately Will knows how to blend, and he knows enough to take advantage of a fortuitous window into another world. Lead by a cat, of course.And then we're off on a constantly moving adventure that covers a tremendous amount of ground in multiple worlds, brings back characters from the first book and introduces many more, and a really astounding number of incidents occur, and so many plotlines. It never is entirely clear how long the whole story takes, but I love every minute of it.***9 January 2020I remembered so little: Will, his mother, Lyra, the knife. I'd forgotten everything that wasn't about them, and a surprising amount that was.I am amused that Pullman is considered an atheist. Perhaps he self-identifies as such, I don't recall. But if he doesn't believe, it isn't because he hasn't heard. This story is steeped in the folklore of the Judeo-Christian God. It seems clear to me that he is only interested in this one particular god out of myriad pantheons and faiths. I find Pratchett's indiscriminate but amused disbelief more compelling.

Like the previous book in this series,\u00a0The Subtle Knife\u00a0is narrated by Philip himself, as well as several cast members. Getting to hear the different voices makes it not only easier to identify who is speaking, but also easier to connect with the characters.The Subtle Knife brings us new characters to love and hate. Although we do get to see Lyra, we also get to spend time with Will as he travels on his own journey. I liked getting to see some familiar faces and how they play an important role in both Lyra and Will's journey. The Subtle Knife may be the shortest book out of this series, but it certainly does not lack for anything.

There first reading and then on subsequent reads you are able to apprehend better what the author is saying.

Here is the schedule we are following! \nThe Golden Compass Nov 30- Dec 5\n\n\nThe Subtle Knife Dec 7-12\n\n\nThe Amber Spyglass Dec 14-19.\n\nHere we go...\u00a0 Our Review: \nSo how long has it been since you first read the book? \n\n\n  B: Hmmmm. I was preggers with my son so it had to be 2010.\n  \n\n  C: I read it immediately after finishing The Golden Compass, so seven years ago.\n  \n\nWhat did you think about the book when you read it the first time?\n\n\n  C: I loved it just as much as I loved The Golden Compass. I think it\u2019s a really great expansion of the series and the world. Plus the way this one ended is really what hooked me on the series.\n  \n\n  B: I wanted to pinch myself in the face. After the first book in 1997 I never continued since I chalked this series up to being childish and this book proves it is anything but.\n  \n\nDo you like it more or less than the first book in the series?\n\n\n  C: Probably about the same amount. I love the way it ends but along the way I think there are less interesting parts. There is a lot more exposition and new characters which is really interesting but I miss the action and for some reasons the stakes don\u2019t feel as high to me. I think maybe it takes more time to get to the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d\n  \n\n  B: This is a really a tough call for me. I think Cassi hit the nail on the head. There is a TON more info to get so that always takes some time. It is all done in a really great manner. I think this might be my fav by a tiny smidge more because Will is just a fantastic character. He is totally the quiet calm to Lyra\u2019s storm. It's kind of like a bomb goes off and blows this plot wide open. What you thought was happening in The Golden Compass is just the trendiest top of the iceberg.i know Cassi loves Will as much as I do.\n  \n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part?\n\n\n  B: *see below* Once again my girl nailed it. The ending is just killer. There is kind of this kind of crescendo that makes you want to just keep on reading (or listening) which is exactly what I did. :-)\n  \n\n  C: The ending. I\u2019m still not over how it ended! The last couple chapters are super intense and so much happens in such a small amount time. It just really escalates and has this huge ending with crazy twists and emotional moments and oh man I had so many feels. Like I said this is when I really got hooked on the series. It\u2019s so freaking epic.\n  \n\nDo you have a least favorite part?\n\n\n  C: Maybe the stuff in Citta\u2019gazze. There are so many trips there and really only one of them is interesting. I mean I like that it\u2019s the place where Will and Lyra meet but other than that I could do without it. And I know I should find the specters scary or interesting but I don\u2019t really.\n  \n\n  B: one name that I despise\u2026.Mrs. Coulter. She is a total \u201cC\u201d word\u2026.. Cotton headed ninny muggins.\n  \n\nIn this book the characters use the subtle knife to move between worlds. If you had a subtle knife what world would you visit?\n\n\n  C: The obvious answer for me is Hogwarts. I would definitely want to visit there so if I could use use it to get there I would definitely want to go. Or maybe Luthadel from the Mistborn series but that\u2019s mostly because I want to do allomancy.\n  \n\n \t  Well after going with Cassi to Hogwarts and drinking our fill of butterbeer I would take a tour of Narnia. Also Westeros perhaps but I would have to find a dragon first. Ohhhhh and of course I would then move myself permanently to Wonderland. Sense is such nonsense.  \nAny new characters that you like or want to talk about? \n\n\n  C: Will. I love Will so much. When he was first introduced I was fangirling so much. He and Lyra are so different which is why I think they work so well together. Lyra is so emotional sometimes where Will is more calculating and cautious. But they look out for one another and help the other person get out of the hard places they\u2019ve gotten themselves into.\n  \n\n \t  See I told you she loves Will as much as I do! Def him. Of course I am really loving my Lee Scorsby and his daemon rabbit Hester. I don't like him as much on the audio as I did in the book though. I also and very drawn to Stanislaus Grumann. He has led such an interesting life and where he started to where he ended up was quite a journey.  \n  C: Yes, Grumann is so interesting. I loved meeting him and learning about his past. He\u2019s a character I forgot about entirely and it was a really great to meet him all over again.\n  \n\nWhat about the characters from the first book? They\u2019re still awesome right?\n\n\n  C: Oh totally. Lyra is just as wonderful here. She\u2019s definitely a little vulnerable at times which I like. She\u2019s always a little bit at risk but here I think the difference is that she is in a vulnerable position because of her own mistake. I love a heroine who\u2019s not perfect and that\u2019s Lyra. Plus like Britt mentioned earlier, Mrs. Coulter is still evil and manipulative and I love to hate her.\n  \n\n  B: Even more so!\n  \n\nWhat did you think about the audiobook?\n\n\n  C: It was so perfect again. Full cast man, that\u2019s where it\u2019s at. Will was perfect. Like I instantly loved the actor who plays him. He absolutely understood Will for me. I also really like the voice for Grumann and Mary Malone. \n  \n\n  B: I agree the only person I am not too thrilled with is Lee, but I think it's in my interpretation. I wanted his Texan accent to be a bit more spot on. I am not loving Iorek. How do you feel about his actor Cassi?\n  \n\n  C: I agree. I think maybe I\u2019m used to it now but I definitely wanted him to sound more southern in the first one. Also it\u2019s hard for me because I think that Sam Elliott who plays him in the movie for The Golden Compass is so perfect that anyone else almost doesn't work.\n  \n\nSo this was a reread, did you get more out of the book? Notice things you missed the first time?\n\n\n  B: I am blown away by how complex this book truly is. We are teetering on the edge of some seriously personnel topics such as theology and spirituality and dare I say religion. There was at least 3 huge plot lines that slipped my mind. \n  \n\n  C: Always. I noticed with all the rereads I have done lately that I always forget most of what happens in the second book. I remembered so little about this book and it was almost like I was experiencing it for the first time which was really cool. Like there\u2019s a big reveal that happens about two-thirds of the way in maybe and I forgot about it completely so when there was a clue that reminded me I was so excited.\n  \n\nExcited for the last book in the series?\n\nB: I couldn't stop reading so yes! I only meant to listened a bit and needed up 5 hours in immediately after finishing TSK. This is where things get crazyC: YES! Oh my god, yes! The way this book ended I need to keep reading. I can\u2019t wait for the ending.\nSo which world so you think you would reside in Cassi?\n\n\n  B: I'd like to think I would come from Lyra\u2019s Oxford. I think I just really want a daemon. Knowing my luck I'd end up in Citta\u2019gazze with the soul sucking specters.\n  \n\n  C: I want a daemon too. Being from Lyra\u2019s Oxford would be amazing but I doubt I would be that lucky either. I\u2019d probably be from that other world that Lord Asriel is in. He\u2019d plotting to take over the world and doing \u00a0other evil things for good reasons and I\u2019d be like, \u201chey maybe, don\u2019t do that? Your call though.\u201d\n  \n\n\n\n Make sure to head over to Cassi's My Thoughts Literally as well! She always has super insightful reviews and her gif game blows me away!

I didn\u2019t hate The Subtle Knife: what Pullman is building up to is a very intriguing concept, his world building is phenomal, and all his characters are thrilling. This second book is a 180\u00ba turn from The Golden Compass: we start fresh with a new protagonist, Will Parry, and this time we start from our world \u2014 a 1997 version of it. Will finds a \u2018window\u2019 to another world, and here is where he quickly meets Lyra and Pantalaimon.The main difference from the previous installment is the presence of multiple narrative lines; whereas before we followed only Lyra\u2019s, we now have Lee Scoresby\u2019s man hunt and the Witches\u2019 journey through the multiverse in search of the girl. This addiction was extremely interesting, but Pullman greatly underused these promising plot lines to focus on Will and Lyra while they - mostly - did nothing. The wasted potential... we could have a very intricate novel with world-travels, instead we spent more than three quarters of the book wandering Oxford and stealing things (no, not even the mini-heist was interesting). Lyra and Will\u2019s story is very static and boring compared to the others, and having all the interesting bits delivered through Lee\u2019s and Serafina\u2019s point of view didn\u2019t help at all!I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s translation that sucks, but I noticed a lot more 3-paragraphs-long-non-stop dialogues, with no interruption to describe the actions of the speaker. There were also a lot info-dumps than the previous book, most of them done thought those infinite conversations. I really, really don\u2019t like how Pullman handled them, we reached the point where no dialogue feelt genuine (or readable). Just because this is a children\u2019s book it doesn\u2019t mean it has be written this way.

His relationship with Lyra is really good and even though I kind of know what happens in the next book, I\u2019m still looking forward to seeing how their relationship\u2026\u2018progresses\u2019.I also really liked how some of the side characters in the previous book were developed more in this one.

However, Will\u2019s backstory is so captivating; since he is part of our world, he is also more relatable than the rebellious but still-aristocratic Lyra. \u2026I was also not sure how I\u2019d feel when Will and Lyra/Pan teamed up (would I bias one over the other, i.e. Lyra over Will? Is there enough space in the narration for everyone?) but they of course made a fitting pairing and their relationship added more layers of character development on both sides. \u2026The atmosphere of Book #1 is dark, with the main antagonist being the children kidnappers. However, there was a certain remoteness given Lyra\u2019s fantastical world. The grimness becomes closer to home in Book #2, as the worlds blur into each other. Science, Morality, and Capitalism:--Physicist Dr. Mary Malone is the other major protagonist introduced, and what a brilliant addition. Lyra and Will are children blundering into a collective struggle that they initially cannot comprehend due to ignorance and yet are capable of learning since their youthful imaginations are still free from oppressive maldevelopment.\u2026Mary, on the other hand, is a former nun who lost her faith and got swept away by what turns out to be another rigid worldview of mainstream science. As I mentioned in my Book #1 review, \u201ccapitalism\u201d is not addressed directly, but it\u2019s really inescapable once you get into social commentary for modern societies. \u2026Mary\u2019s scientific research into \u201cdark matter\u201d is reliant on funding, which is running out. However, military funding is plentiful, despite the end of the Cold War. Clearly we can see a contradiction between scientific exploration and the hierarchies of society (violence, profit). \u2026If we take a political economy perspective, we can dive into how capitalism\u2019s profits are dependent on numerous layers of externalities (in the sense of things capitalists can avoid paying for) to reduce their costs thus maintain their profits. \u2026Thus, capitalism is reliant on the \u201cState\u201d not just for the creation and protection of capitalist property rights, but also for providing capitalists with subsidized infrastructure necessary to maintain profits. This infrastructure includes both physical and social (educated and dependent labor force) as well as subsidized inputs (cheap materials where the costs have been externalized, i.e. pollution/dispossession/exploited global labor; government-funded research-and-development for new technologies to privatize and monopolize, i.e. patent monopolies). ...For a great discussion on this between Noam Chomsky and Yanis Varoufakis, see: https://youtu.be/szIGZVrSAyc?t=389...Examples of capitalism's logic on various industries:-Bad Pharma: How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm Patients-Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks (useful section on the media)-America by Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism-Science-Mart: Privatizing American Science-\"Intellectual Property\": A Libertarian Critique-Steal This Idea: Intellectual Property Rights and the Corporate Confiscation of Creativity\u2026All this is barely touched in this book.

Following the first book Northern Lights \u2013 an adventure set within a universe that is like ours, but different in many ways \u2013 The Subtle Knife really delves into inter-universal travel.When twelve-year-old Will Parry accidentally kills an intruder, he runs away from his home in Oxford as well as her sick mother and discovers a portal to a parallel universe. In the strange and unsettling world of Citt\u00e0gazze, he encounters Lyra Belacqua and her d\u00e6mon Pantalaimon, who arrived via a hole in the sky from her own world. Together, Will and Lyra journey to face new threats and discover the truth behind Dust.Although this is the second instalment in the trilogy, Pullman takes an interesting approach to start the book as instead of beginning where we left off with Lyra at the end of Northern Lights, The Subtle Knife opens with our world and the introduction of Will and his situation. Given his initial establishment as a troubled kid who is determined to keep his poor mother out of harm, even if he leaves her at a friend\u2019s home, Will isn\u2019t simply the male-version of Lyra as both characters who may come from different worlds and have their own motives, their bond is what gives this book a beating heart.Unlike its predecessor which had a linear narrative with Lyra driving the story, this sequel follows the tradition of a trilogy\u2019s second act (i.e. Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings) with the story being told through the perspective of multiple characters including Lyra, Will, the witch Serafina Pekkala and everyone\u2019s favourite aeronaut Lee Scoresby. Despite the lack of Lord Asriel and King Iorek Byrnison, the ensemble cast is compelling and the mysteries that run through the three universes such as the Spectres of Citt\u00e0gazze who haunt adults but not children and the true reveal of explorer Stanislaus Grumman who was apparently beheaded.Amidst the numerous threats towards Will and Lyra including the children of Citt\u00e0gazze who become as terrifying as the characters of Lord of the Flies, the story comes to a halt when we are introduced to Dr Mary Malone. When Lyra meets the ambitious physicist at our world\u2019s Oxford, there is a long discussion about Dust, otherwise known as dark matter and the answers towards the subject are given by Lyra\u2019s alethiometer and possibly the I Ching system of divination. Certainly this deep dive into scientific jargon will be heavy for some readers, and yet one can appreciate Pullman for treating his readers with respect and intelligence and although this delves more into the criticism of religion, not least from Lord Asriel waging war against the Authority AKA God, he never loses the childlike wonder and horror of the story.Following the linear storytelling of Northern Lights, The Subtle Knife taking place in three parallel universes is a more challenging read and yet a compelling one with its expansion of mysteries and build-up to an epic conclusion.To be concluded with \nThe Amber Spyglass\n.", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1507836024", "review_id": "1507836024", "date": "Jan 13, 2016", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Devanshi Gupta", "user_url": "/user/show/44115497-devanshi-gupta", "text": "Survival first, morals laterCan I just say that this book is getting a little too tragic?When I had read the Golden Compass I had fallen in love with the main protagonist Lyra, the thought provoking concepts and the fantastical writing. Now I must say that I am a little disappointed. For one thing I would have expected a lot more of Lyra but all I got was this dominating main character Will who stole all the glory. Granted Will was an interesting character and his mother was a dear, he was nothing compared to Lyra herself.Throughout the novel Lyra kept following Will around. She seriously apologized to him for using her compass to discover dust; which had thrown her life in disarray instead of helping him; a complete stranger to her at the time find his father. Tell me what is more important? She infact said she was selfish and this is a desperate attempt to make Will the main character. I missed Lyra a lot; her character changed and she was not the same ferocious girl I knew. And their relationship was very forced. Roger was mentioned so little that it broke my heart.This novel allowed us to explore the lives of many more characters which were interesting. Serafina Pekkala and her entourage of witches were flawless, strong and brave women whom I especially adored.Lee Scoresby was a very tough and good character with a dashing entrance. His life and fatherly love for Lyra was truly touching and I kid you not but his POVs began to interest me by the end whereas towards the starting they had seemed irritating.The ultimate concept of this series is revealed in this novel along with Lyra's true identity and it really chills me out. I can't wait to see the mighty end.As for the Spectres they did not remind me of vampires. They reminded me of zombies which is a result of my obsession with The Walking Dead. I think I now have a third sense that makes me sees walkers in everything. The concept of this new apocoplyptic world was cool and new and different, something I could obsess over. But the way the story kept jumping from this world to that was a little hard to follow and irritating.This book took the series to a whole new level but if I compare this with the Golden Compass I can't say that this book improved on it.

It was lovely seeing their relationship grow and trust build between them (plus: him and Pan!).It\u2019s illuminating, too, seeing Lyra from outside herself: by viewing her through Will's eyes, we get an even better image/idea of her character.

Sigh. It is the book that introduces us to Will. And so it will always be most precious to me. The third will always be my favorite of them all, though. But my gosh, how I love all three to pieces. They are so very good. I'm thrilled to read them again.As always, the writing in this book was perfect. I have no trouble at all connecting with the world and with the characters. I always have a fear when re-reading books that I love, that I will not love them the same, but I am pretty sure I will always love this trilogy, no matter what. Simply because these books are fully precious.And I love Lyra to pieces. And I might love Will even more. And then together they are perfection. Gosh. I will not be writing such a long review for this book either this time as I have already done so many times. But I must share a bit of my love for this stunning book. And the love I feel for it is too much. We get to see more of Lyra. She was so fierce and wild in Northern Lights. In this book she is still fierce, still a little wild, but she is also growing up more. Becoming more still and careful. Still fully adorable, though. I love her so much. And her d\u00e6mon, Pan. He is beyond adorable and the two of them together is the cutest thing. I so love reading about them, always.But then there was Will. Eee. In this book we learn about different worlds. Where Lyra came from, the world she escaped to, and the world Will came from, which is more like our own. Reading about when Lyra and Will met again was just the best thing. I ship them so so hard. I adore their growing friendship beyond words. I love how fierce Will was and how determined he was. How he made Lyra think about how she was behaving. And reading about the two of them together pretty much broke me, as always.But my god, how badly I love Will. He is the best part of these books. Okay, I love everything about these books, but I love Will the most. Getting to know him was the best. He is twelve years old. He have taken care of his mother for years and years. They are all alone and she is not well. It broke my heart to read about. Sigh. But he was way too precious and I loved how much he loved his mother. Sigh. Gosh, that story is a heartbreaking one. He have been looking for his father since he was a baby, as he is missing.This is a book about Lyra and Will meeting and getting to know each other. It is about finding the subtle knife, learning how to use it. The best scenes were how Lyra was helping Will after he got hurt, and Pan helping him too, and sigh. My poor heart. It is a book about Will searching for his father, and Lyra having to do so too. It is also all about the first book and every character in that one too. There are the witches. There is Lee Scoresby, whom I adore, and whose fate I am still angry about, haha. But so very good too. There is so much going on in this book. So much pain and heartbreak. And many new things to learn about too. And gosh, how I loved all of it. This whole world is stunning to read about. It is special and exciting and thrilling at every moment. Reading about the adventures of Lyra and Will is the best thing. And re-reading The Subtle Knife was just perfect. And I am thrilled to be re-reading these books again, finally. You need to read them too. There is so much I could write about this book, but stopping for now.---I first read this book on April 20th 2013.

Seriously, this series has a bad habit with cliffhangers. :(:(Well the story started a few days after the other cliffhanger in The Golden Compass. But it didn\u2019t tell of Lyra straight away. It introduced a new hero. Will Parry was a teenage boy about Lyra\u2019s age. His father gone and he stuck taking care of his mother with a mental disorder. When strange men began to come to them, looking something about his father and scared his mother, Will got his mother to safety and went to seek his father, unintentionally killed someone and became a wanted criminal. He then found a window lead to another world where he met Lyra. On the other hand, Lyra, still trying to find out about Dust received a mission from the alethiometer to stop looking for Dust and help Will to find his father. And so the went to their adventures together.This second book feels different from the first and somehow disconnected. Suddenly Will appeared out of nowhere and took Lyra\u2019s place as the main character. Even Lyra\u2019s mission to find out about Dust and stop lord Asriel seemed unimportant at all. They got a new mission and new problems involving Will\u2019s father. The writing style is slightly different too or maybe I just felt that way because there\u2019s a lot of POVs here while in the first book there\u2019s only Lyra\u2019s. Anyway, apart from the awkward differences, this book is wonderful. The new characters, especially Will, are great. Will is officially my new favorite character. I used to like Lyra but she\u2019s awfully childish in this book especially at the beginning where she\u2019s such a brat, always wishing Iorek would come and solve her problems. I knew how she loved and depended on Iorek but she used to be more independent. The problem also grow a lot bigger now that it\u2019s clear there are more than one world and it became more and more exciting though it\u2019s a bit hard for me to imagine the subtle knife and all those windows to another world.", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6472951", "review_id": "6472951", "date": "Sep 19, 2007", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Hunter", "user_url": "/user/show/376188-hunter", "text": "I read the first book in this trilogy, The Golden Compass, after seeing the trailer for the upcoming movie. I had also heard it described as a sort of Chronicles of Narnia for atheists. Upon delving into the second book I've come to realize that description is not really accurate. The series seems to be deeply concerned with spiritual matters, and the fundamental connections between theology and science. It does freely rail against organized religion, but not belief in general.Beyond the weightier issues that this book tackles, it is just flat out good writing. All of the characters are richly developed, particularly Will Parry who is introduced in this volume. The book speeds towards a cliff hanger conclusion and I defy anyone not to be moved by the chapter \"The Alamo Gulch.\"I know it's passe to describe middle sections of trilogies to The Empire Strikes Back but it's a fair enough reference point. Our heroes are separated, people are dying, and things seem pretty hopeless.This book brought to mind two pretty disparate works- Legion by William Peter Blatty and Preacher by Garth Ennis, Steve Dillon, et al.

While I enjoyed reading this second book in the series, especially the second half, there wasn\u2019t a story arch that started and ended in this book. In fact, since I read the first book last September, it took me a while to reorient myself in this world since readers are thrown in without any type of recap. The world building was my favorite part of this book, watching how the story has expanded to include other worlds and mythologies. The storylines of the various characters from the first book start to intersect quite a bit more in this second installment, too. Something I noticed even more in this second book is that amount of scenes that told from an adult POV. I realized that is very unusual in a YA book; I rarely see that in books written in the 2000s. I wonder if that is what makes these books universally appealing to a wide age range, or why adults who read this series as a child continue to enjoy it as adults, too. I'd highly recommend listening to this on audio since there is a full cast of voice actors.

So of all the books in His Dark Materials trilogy I only really remember Northern Lights (aka The Golden Compass) so re-reading The Subtle Knife was pretty much like reading it for the first time, and I have to say... I don't know.So the fundamental reason the rating got lowered is because of how childish I now find this book - mostly in terms of how it's written and Lyra's dialogue especially really irks me.What I thoroughly enjoyed however was the world jumping, the idea of the subtle knife, the tension of hoping Will completes his mission and just the general point of the book; Fallen Angels, Religion, Magic. Bloody hell this is supposed to be a children's novel!I don't remember reading so far into the context of the book beforehand at a younger and less worldly age but now - that's what I want to discover more of... but unfortunately the novel only touches and alludes to that - the bigger picture - and instead predominantly follows around two kids under the age of 13.Sigh.", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_id": "41637836-the-subtle-knife", "book_title": "The Subtle Knife", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1272362042", "review_id": "1272362042", "date": "May 05, 2015", "rating": 5, "user_name": "N\u0259rmin", "user_url": "/user/show/36595208-n-rmin", "text": "That cliff-hanger!

A lot of concepts (and characters) introduced in the first volume are fleshed out in more detail in this book. Once again, Pullman's worlds are as rich as his writing, making for such an engrossing read. This book brings back many familiar faces, plus a few new ones. The most important of these is Will Parry, who I love just as much as Lyra. As Pullman's universes expand, he maintains control of them all. I will say, they generally have a very Eurocentric feel, but that's a minor complaint. While the main \"behind the scenes\" antagonist of The Golden Compass is the Magisterium (that is to say, structured religious organizations), its in this book that that boogeyman begins to shift towards religion itself. Out of the three books in this series, I think The Subtle Knife is the strongest in part because it deals with religious allegory the best--the first is a bit too vague, the third is at times annoyingly explicit in its attempt to recast and re-frame Genesis.
