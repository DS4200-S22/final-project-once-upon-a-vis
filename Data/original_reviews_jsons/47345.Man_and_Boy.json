After the success of \u2018Man & Boy\u2019 the following novels from Parsons essentially followed and relied on the same narrative template.Whatever happened to the former \u2018enfants terrible\u2019 of the UK music press, who along with Julie Burchill terrorised the staid, conservative and self-indulgent writings of their elder music journalist peers? Well I guess they grew up, like we all do \u2013 but maybe along the way some of that fire has certainly been lost, that attention grabbing and exciting music journalism became by comparison, utterly mundane in these generic \u2018modern/contemporary\u2019 novels. These novels by Tony Parsons, whilst largely proficient, lack excitement and inspiration \u2013 ultimately betraying all that early promise. Unless of course all that \u2018kicking against the establishment\u2019 was merely a pose, a pretension symptomatic of the time and perhaps rooted in an underlying and cynical careerist agenda all along \u2013 who knows? Whilst Parson was initially kicking against the establishment back in the late 1970\u2019s, he then quite decidedly became the establishment \u2013 an inevitable transition perhaps, but such a \u2018revolt into style\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily have to equate to such a literary decline. Where Parsons once had so much to say, there now seems so little to be told. Parsons is now reportedly a staunch supporter of the UK Conservative Party and now apparently rails against people having tattoos\u2026need I say more?There is in the end, nothing particularly bad about these novels \u2013 they are proficient and mildly diverting, but they do lack any real excitement, seem bereft of inspiration and are \u2013 ultimately disposable.

The fact that people do fall in and out of love. The pressure that people have in today's society to be happy and romantic all the time. I don't know why people kid themselves into thinking being with someone is an easy task. It's really not, espeically when you're with eachother for life and have a family.It made me empathise with little Pat, a child of divorce. The majority of my friends and exfriends have had divorced parents but they never really talk about it. What it was like when they intially split up. I'm so very lucky to have parents that have stayed together. The book brings to light the horrendous damage that divorce can bring upon a child and a parent. The quote that really got me;\"You need a license to drive a car. You need a license to own a dog, but anyone can bring a child into the world.\" It's true. Of course I'm not at liberty to really give my oppinion on parenting and in some cases- love itself. I'm only seventeen.I've kinda veered off the point of this review.

It was not easy getting close to the last 50 pages to see that he really does not see past his own problems and identity crisis.

The affection Harry feels for his family, all of it, is obvious from the first page. As evident is Harry\u2019s sense of self. He comes to realise that what he feels isn\u2019t always enough, though. Approaching his thirtieth birthday, Harry is lost in between. He is no longer a child, but does not feel properly mature. He is married, but is unsure what that means. He loves his family, but isn\u2019t quite sure why. But, Harry knows himself, even if \u2018himself\u2019 baffles him, and that thread is what makes this story so brilliant: Harry\u2019s utter honesty. He makes mistakes and owns up to them. He feels and is ready to share that fact. He loves unconditionally, which is both uplifting and heartbreaking all at once. A month before his birthday, full of BIG questions and doubts, Harry makes a mistake. Then, within the course of thirty days, he loses everything he considered important. Over the next six months, he gains it all back, but not necessarily in the same form. Harry learns to be a father, not just a man with a young boy. He begins to understand his own father. He figures out what is important, and who, and he learns what love is. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Harry\u2019s voice was so real. At times, his observations were funny, at others, wrenching. I forgave him his mistake. I hated his wife. I cheered Harry\u2019s successes and secretly plotted Gina\u2019s failure. I loved that none of the characters were heroes (except for the possible exception of Harry\u2019s dad). They were all ordinary people and could be wholly uncompromising. Not a one of them changed their mind for the sake of the plot or story; they were all themselves to the end. Even Harry\u2014though he grew. At the end of the book, he was still Harry, still \u2018himself\u2019, but a much more content version. There is a sequel, Man and Wife.

Gradfather Paddy, 70 something, typical for his generation, has been in the war, that is a very manly man. Father Harry, 30, left by his wife, forced to take care of his child by himself. Pat, 5, little cute boy with small worries. On the backcover Mail on Sunday says that the book is a love letter to a son from his father, and to a father from his son. That is absolutely right. A perfect way to describe the book. Thames in the book are fathers and families in the chaotic world of today and the peaceful world of yesterday. (Ok, that's a little too rough.) Anyway. The role of the father in a family. Is the mother supposed to do all houswork and mind the children and the father to go to work and bring in money? Hardly. Not today. But some men and woman still take for granted that there are separate men's and women's duties. Dad drives the car, and mum does the cooking. It's all about the upbringing. I mean, take our house. Mum seratinly used to do all the cooking and cleaning etc, and now when she can't, I do it. Well, not the cleaning, cos most of the time I don't see that necessary, but the cooking. Cos dad can't cook, but I can, even thou I hadn't cooked that much before I took over mun's duties. I couldn't imagine anything else. Well, I wonder if there's a point in this. Anyway. I just loved the book, and am eagerly looking forward to reading the sequel and anything ekse by Tony Parsons.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2005"]}, {"book_id_title": "47345.Man_and_Boy", "book_id": "47345", "book_title": "Man and Boy", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/695520678", "review_id": "695520678", "date": "Aug 15, 2013", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Kishel Bactong", "user_url": "/user/show/9071363-kishel-bactong", "text": "I laughed and then cried, then some time in the beginning, threw it because of frustration. This book had me. It tugged my heart and lifted up some of the pessimistic views I have about love and men, life in general. This novel is about a producer, a husband and a father who made a mistake that caused him his wife. At first, I can't feel sorry for him. I just cannot find the nerve to forgive men who break their women's heart easily. They deserve to rot or work in a public high school canteen..in jersey. He goes by the name Harry by the way. So his wife left him and brought their 4 year-old son with her. But when she went away to go to Japan to, get this, 'follow her dreams..' Harry took his child to his care. Well, it was hard for him. He basically has ZERO knowledge how to raise a kid. But he persevered, with the help of his dad and his mom. By and by, he changed, he even turned down a big job just to be a father. He thought, he has been a failure. As a husband, as a son and he wants to try not fail to be a father. This is a story of how a man learns to know the meaning of true love and its realities or lack thereof of happy endings. This is a journey of a boy and a man. If there's something I have learned about this book is that nobody is perfect. We all make mistakes one way or another, its just that men are far better in picking and worse mistakes. Men are men and they will always act like how they are programmed (y'know what I mean, right? I need not spell this out?). Another thing, it is understandable for ladies to feel hurt, betrayed and all that, but there should always be room for forgiveness. Even the biggest act of betrayal is forgivable. They make mistakes, so are the ladies. Let's face it, men will hurt women, they will say sorry and beg for forgiveness, that's no assurance that they will not hurt them again. Forgive and keep on fighting for true happiness, for happy endings doesn't just land in your lap, you have to work for it.

I discovered this book earlier in the year and finally decided to pick it up. It felt like a contemporary to me. This was not a blow me away, wow me book by any means but it was so well told, and so heart felt. This author can definitely tug on the readers heart strings. And if you don't feel something while you read this book then you need to turn your emotions on.Set in England you have this story of a beautiful family, Gina, Harry and their 4 year old son, Pat. Harry, who is turning 30, makes one big mistake and that it all it takes to drastically change all their lives and their families lives. Harry and his family try their best to heal from the mistake and so this story goes.I loved the characters in this story they were so vivid in my mind. I could picture each one of them. So many different types of people, eccentric, down to earth, wild and crazy. And I think I feel in love with most of them. I loved watching the growth of our main character Harry. You could not help but love who he is and who he becomes as well. I could not really pick out an antagonist as they all had their own issues and struggles to overcome. This story was definitely character driven rather than plot driven, which worked well. The main plot was the one that counted the most and I thought it was very well written.I can recommend this book to those who love a great heart engaging contemporary story with vivid characters and a beautiful plot line. It was truly engaging and irresistible to read. I thought though, that it could have had just a little bit more to it.

Note even after six months of trying having such a career she will come back to the mould, request primary residence for her son and that will be it with maybe a second child later on with the new husband. As for the mother the book has tremendously aged. But back to the story line. She picks the first pretext she can find to run away. An easy task since boys will be boys and men will be men: they cannot escape the curse of the knob, as the husband Harry calls it, that makes them masculine. They have to rub it and to dip it into the first sheath available.Then the story centers on this man and his son. Harry learns how to take care of his son Pat. He becomes a single parent father. And he is successful at it. And yet the boy misses something. Guess what. The mother is in Japan having her own life with some Richard American expat, or something like that since it is not important who he is, his name, his position. He is just the man this frustrated woman picks to step back down into nuclear frustration. Poor Pat, and he is not the postman.Third, the author doubles this picture with a second mirror image, hence inverted which makes thing \u201cnormal\u201d meaning straight. A woman, Cyd, an expat from Texas who has kicked her British BMW motorbike monster of a husband out of her immediate life and lives with her/their four year old daughter Peggy. Poor Peggy who is also missing something, a father probably. This makes the film utterly moralistic as for the definition of the parents of a child. There is no same sex marriage and no children with two fathers or two mothers, and children with single parents are seen as victims. A child has to have two parents and these have to be a man and a woman. Full stop! No question asked, hence no question answered. At the very end, in a club, there is a vague mention of gay men, but it sounds like some frustration on the part of the main character. Fourth. With that stuff the author makes a novel that is definitely new with some novel (new and not resembling something formerly known or used) ideas. It is true a lot less novel today. He now centers the novel on the father first and his efforts at becoming a true loving father and at providing his son with a new mother and a sister, Cyd and Peggy. But Cyd and Peggy are running away from such a choice, at least Cyd is, and Peggy follows. Pat just makes a new friend, but this time a boy whose identity is meaningless, except that we go back into a clich\u00e9: a boy with a boy, girls are for later.Yet the author avoids the soap opera with tears and whining mice and rats inter-devouring one another. Just one episode is important for the story: the relation of Pat with the parents of his father. The grandfather plays a role and particularly when he dies of cancer. The boy Pat at the age of five discovers death in a man he likes. Yet that loss is not exploited beyond the plain anecdote. For a child this age such an event is a trauma, and cannot be anything but a trauma. She child may be deeply disturbed, especially if he does not seem to be really shocked because he should. But of course it would have been another novel. So why introduce this death if it is not exploited? There is absolutely no reason why this grandfather has to die in this novel. It does not change the course of events at all, at least for the child. The novel at least avoids that possibility. So why mention the anecdote.Sixth. This death provides the \u201cend\u201d of the novel, but not in the child Pat, rather in the child Harry, because at this moment the father regresses to what he used to be as a child and he is deeply hurt, shocked and transformed by this death. Not on his own but thanks to the mother who has a tremendous power of adaptation. Harry\u2019s mother goes through the funeral, survives her solitude and confides her secret to her surprised son. \u201cLove means knowing when to let go.\u201d Love then becomes a deep emotion that never leaves the one who lets go and it becomes the deepest inspiration for the one who goes, who is let to go, in this case Pat who is let to go by his father Harry. The book though does not seem to see the difference between letting go a dead man into death and letting go a child into a recomposed family. But I guess such contradictions are part of the genre. And the father drops all desire to get primary residence for his son and he lets the son\u2019s mother and her recomposed family have it. Note the child becomes then a pure possession.This is heavily emphasized by the reference to the film \u201cCinema Paradiso\u201d (Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, 1988) by Giuseppe Tornatore. Harry sees the film in a cinema with Cyd and the author summarizes it slightly skimpily: \u201c. . . an Italian film . . . about a young boy\u2019s friendship with the old projectionist at the local movie house. . . at the end when the gruff old projectionist, now blinded by a fire in the cinema, tells the Bambi-eyed young boy, now a teenager, to leave their village and never come back. The boy, Toto, goes away and becomes a famous film director and doesn\u2019t come back to his little village for thirty years, on the day that they are burying Alfredo, the old projectionist who taught him to love the cinema and then sent him away. . . Because Alfredo knew that Toto would never find the things he needed in that little town. . . He had to break free so that he could learn what Alfredo already knew Life is not what you see in films \u2013 life is much harder. [dixit Cyd]\u201d (p. 257-258)I regret the skimpiness of this summary because it misses absolutely everything important about the son Pat, because it cuts out Toto\u2019s dead father, Toto\u2019s sister nearly killed by a fire in the cinema, Toto\u2019s mother, the two fire incidents in the cinema, the rebuilding of this cinema, Toto\u2019s love affair with Elena, a rich man\u2019s daughter, etc. In fact the film should have led the novel into another direction, but life is not what it looks like in films. Surely it is not, but the cinema teaches us great ideas and truths that life at times forgets to teach us and here the main idea is that Salvatore (Toto) has no father, needs a father substitute and finds one in Alfredo the projectionist. Toto is fascinated by the cinema (as an art and communicational medium) but his sister nearly dies in a fire in that local cinema (as a plain building that is inflammable). And Toto needs this father substitute to tell him: \u201cOK, boy, it is time for you to go and realize your dream, live your life!\u201d But Alfredo cheated in a way, and yet Salvatore would never have realized his dream of becoming a film director if Alfredo had not cheated and had not decided to lose a friend in order for that friend to become what his potential made him capable of becoming, and that future man will be able to hyg Alfredo on his deathbed if not in his coffin. To expand this theme let me quote the full synopsis of the film as given by the users of IMDb.\u201cBeginning at the end, the movie opens with Salvatore's mother trying to inform him of the death of Alfredo. Salvatore, a filmmaker who has not been home since his youth, leaves Rome immediately to attend the funeral. Through flashbacks we watch Salvatore in his youth, in a post WWII town in Southern Italy. As a young boy he is called Toto and he has a strong affinity for the cinema. Toto often sneaks into the movie theater when he shouldn't and harasses the projectionist, Alfredo, in attempts to get splices of film that are cut out by the church because they contain scenes of kissing. Toto has a younger sister and war widowed mother who often struggle due to the loss of Toto's father. Toto is banned from the movie theater by his mother when his film bits accidentally catch fire and nearly kill his sister along with burning up the only picture Toto has of his father along with other family photographs. Eventually he sneaks his way back and forms a father-son bond with Alfredo, despite Alfredo's reluctancy, Toto even learns how to run the projector. Meanwhile one of the townspeople wins the lotto and becomes a rich man. One day in the cinema, after Toto leaves to watch the movie with his friends below, the film catches fire in the projector and knocks Alfredo out. Young Toto rescues Alfredo from death in the fire, unfortunately the cinema burns down and Alfredo loses his sight. Lucky the lotto-lucky-townsman pays to have a new cinema put up. Since Toto already knows how to run the projector he works with Alfredo in the projection room. Some years pass and Salvatore is now a young man. A rich girl, Elena, comes to town and Salvatore and his friends vie for her attention. Salvatore films her and begins to fall in love. Alfredo advises him to steer clear of love because it only causes pain. Despite his warning, Salvatore confesses his love to Elena, whose reply is that she does not, but she could. So he waits, every night outside her house for her reply. One day he gives up and trudges home depressed and upset only to soon discover that Elena does love him in return. They begin a passionate romance, like that of two newlyweds. Unfortunately, Elena's father doesn't approve and so he takes Elena away. All summer they try to meet, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. On one particular day he tries to reach her and she him but their paths don't cross. As we discover later, Alfredo catches Elena and convinces her to leave Salvatore alone out of love. Salvatore then wanders without purpose and eventually joins the military due to the requirement by Italian law that all male youths serve for a period of time in the army. When he returns to his home town, all has changed and he cannot adjust. Alfredo urges him to leave and tells him that if he were to ever return, he would not see him. Obviously Salvatore goes on to become a successful filmmaker. As he wanders the remains of his town after the funeral he sees a vision of Elena just as she was when they were young; he realizes it is Elena's daughter and follows her to Elena's home where he sees that she married one of Salvatore's childhood friends, a dunce when Salvatore knew him. He confronts Elena and they meet. They talk and she reveals to him that she didn't miss out on their fateful reunion but rather that Alfredo convinced her to leave. Salvatore realizes what a role Alfredo had in shaping his life and that Alfredo knew that if he stayed with Elena he would have no chance to pursue his love of film and so by going to Rome to become a filmmaker he sacrificed his love for Elena. Salvatore and Elena say farewell and go their separate ways. Salvatore returns to Rome with a can of film left to him by Alfredo. It contains all the splices of the kissing scenes from Salvatore's youth.\u201d (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095765/s..., accessed May 13, 2016 )You can now realize how much the author missed, how many opportunities he missed on the side of Harry as well as on Toto\u2019s side. The fact that Harry had been invited by Cyd to see that film with her in Soho is also extremely meaningful and the summary Cyd gives is so far from what is relevant: desire is one thing but it has no future in itself whereas love is not desire and it is able to see beyond the emotion the interest of the loved one who has to move away on his or her own road to eventually fulfill his or her promise, potential, future. We have our future in our own mind and brain but our body\u2019s desires may tie us up so strongly at crucial moments in our lives that we miss the train and we reach the station too late. If we are lucky we can see the red lights of the train moving away and maybe learn a lesson for next time we try to catch a train: don\u2019t linger satisfying your bodily functions and rush after your spiritual potential. Life is cruel if you do not do the latter. Life is beautiful if you do. I thus dedicate this review to a young man who has been my assistant for seven years and has to go on his own road. Don\u2019t miss your train in the name of what is good now. Your train will not wait for you. Finally this novel has a happy ending for \u201ceveryone\u201d though we could doubt the happiness of this ending but I won\u2019t reveal it. It is good at times to run amok in a love story in modern garb, but please do not throw cobblestones on the pianist.

Harry has demonstrated excellent parenting skills by putting Pat first after Gina\u2019s abandonment. Harry made sure that Pat felt comfortable at home and in school. He made sure Pat had friends to interact and have fun with. Harry was also willing to work out the marital problems he and Gina were experiencing. Harry never left Pat. Therefore, Harry should have equal rights and opportunities as a parent. Pat has two parents and considering Harry\u2019s love and concern for Pat, Harry should be awarded custody of his child.\tHarry has demonstrated good parenting skills by being present for Pat and taking care of his needs. When Harry loses his job as producer of the Marty Mann show he does not initially take another job so he can take care of Pat. Pat is having problems at the nursery school as a result of his mother leaving him and going to live in Japan. Harry receives a job offer as executive producer of a new television show with the comic, Eamon Fish. He goes to the interview with Pat and realizes he cannot work a full time job and take care of Pat. Once again Harry puts Pat first in his life. Only when Eamon arrives at his flat to ask him to work part time as a producer does Harry accept the position. Harry takes Pat out of nursery school when it is obvious Pat is having trouble. Harry let Pat do what was best for him at the time, clearly showing his understanding of his child\u2019s needs. When Pat is almost five years old, Harry enrolls him in kindergarten. Pat makes his first friend, Peggy. Now he really enjoys it and is well adjusted because of how his father treated him. Harry also makes sure Pat is only with safe family members. Gina had wanted Pat to stay with her father who left Pat with his daughter Sally (from an abandoned marriage) and her boyfriend. Harry walks in and sees the boyfriend and Sally making out and smoking and removes Pat from the house. Instead of using Sally as a babysitter Harry lets Pat spend time with his own parents. Pat\u2019s grandparents are wise and knowledgeable and love Pat, showing him a good time in a safe setting. Even when he needs more help Harry calls upon a family friend, Auntie Ethel, to help him. As a parent, Harry is a very good father.\tHarry has a willingness to work on his marriage with Gina. Gina expresses no interest in any attempt to reconcile the differences in their marriage. Gina\u2019s father\u2019s \u201chippie womanizing\u201d life style of abandoning children as he went along profoundly affects Gina and her attitude toward marriage. She felt that Harry\u2019s one sexual encounter out of their marriage equated his behavior to her own father\u2019s. Harry had become a womanizing beast in her mind. Even when Harry had shown he had just made a mistake and could hold up a nuclear family. It was Gina\u2019s own fears as a child that made her marriage collapse and abandon her son. Gina then went to Japan to focus her career as an interpreter. Although Gina\u2019s lawyers present her traveling to Japan to be the only opportunity for her to make a life and career for her and Pat; her abandonment of Pat shows a selfish, self centered, ego driven woman. While she is trying to get her career going and intending to send for Pat, Pat is suffering from the abandonment of his mother. Gina also is having an affair with a married businessman in Japan. Gina was a wonderful mother to Pat before her Japan adventure but she has now gone to the \u201cdark side of the Force.\u201d In question is her character, will she have another breakdown and ruin her life and Pat\u2019s life? The issue of Pat being exposed to inappropriate music is an ironic one because Gina\u2019s own stepsister, Sally gave it to Pat as a gift. Gina states that Pat is allowed to watch violent films unsupervised. Pat has been watching the Star Wars triology since he was quite young with permission from Gina. This is not an arguable issue since the Star Wars films are extremely violent for a young child to be exposed to. In reference to the Harry\u2019s failure to provide a safe environment, this is also not relevant. The terrible biking accident that Pat experienced makes Gina feel that Harry is a bad parent. Any parent knows that anyone can look away for a split second and have their child suffer a serious injury. In no way does that event make Harry a negligent, irresponsible parent.\tFathers should have equal rights to the custody of a child. Typically, children are not given a voice in custody battles. Harry tries to give Pat such a voice. Pat feels safe and secure with Harry and had adjusted to Gina\u2019s absence from his life. His success at kindergarten is evidence of this. \u201cIf very small children could speak, they would not choose to divide their lives in half. It is just not developmentally appropriate.\u201d (McBroom, 1999). Pat wants to remain living with Harry. \u201cWe would look, first of all, to who is performing the actual parenting.\u201d (University of California at Berkeley) In this case, Harry is performing the parenting as Gina has abandoned her son and is now off having an affair with a married man.\t\u201cThe absence of a father from a child\u2019s life can lead to a wide variety of negative behavioral and educational consequences.\u201d (Larson, 2003).\u201cAttachment refers to the strong emotional bond that develops between children and their primary caregivers\u2026 Establishing a stable, trusting relationship with a caregiver is an important component of early social development\u2026 Early attachment has a long term influence on children\u2019s adjustment to school and social skills\u2026\u201d (Passer and Smith 473-475) Although the mother/son bond is important the father/son bond is equally important.In England, a parent no longer is granted \u201ccustody\u201d according to the Children Act of 1989 but a residence order is issued. \u201cResidency replaces custody as a way of removing the confrontational nature of deciding where a child lives. A residence order does not deprive any other person of parental responsibility. The law was changed to make it clear that a child is not a possession that can be won or lost. Under the terms of a residence order, a child lives with you. But a child does not belong to you.\u201d (Parsons 298-299).Harry should be granted custody of Pat because he is a good father. Harry did not abandon Pat like Gina did, causing Pat emotional turmoil and the need to be taken out of nursery school. Harry is a loving, supportive and caring parent who puts Pat before everything else in his life (such as his career). Gina abandons not only Pat, but also the marriage, with absolutely no desire to keep the nuclear family intact. Harry is a man with much integrity. He shows it through his love for Pat and his willingness to do anything for him. Harry should be granted residency. Good fathers should have an equal chance.

It doesn\u2019t have to be necessarily the love between man and women; in this case it\u2019s father and son. I really enjoyed how the novel Man and Boy portrays this theme in a very detailed manner when Harry is left alone to take care of his Pat. The father son relationship grows as Harry does everything he can to raise his child. The author was very powerful while describing the setting and characters in the first few chapters. The amount of detail put in the novel made the readers experience the story firsthand. In my opinion a story that has a great description of the settings and characters establishes its greatness from the first few chapters. Man and Boy had curiosity in almost every chapter, as the reader I was excited, curious and stayed glued to my seat wanting to know what happened in the next page.Although there are a lot of positive influences in this novel, there are also negatives which shouldn\u2019t be ignored such as the ending being very fairy tale like and fake; also events in this novel happened suddenly. Normally to average humans it would take them time to get into another relationship after divorce, however Harry met a new lady and got married within a few months of his break up. This book makes it out to seem that in reality there is always a happy ending. However sometimes things don\u2019t end up in a fairy tale style ending. Man and Boy is a novel with a roller-coaster of emotions, describing feelings and mental thought process in an extraordinary way. The novel showcases the importance of strength within a relationship and the importance of a relationship. This novel appealed to me because of all the drama, romance and plot twists it had stored within it. The novel started of very boring and randomly took a twist making it very interesting. Personally I was satisfied with this book. If you are interested in a novel with romance, corruption, plot twists and drama, this novel will be a good read for you.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "47345.Man_and_Boy", "book_id": "47345", "book_title": "Man and Boy", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3102735055", "review_id": "3102735055", "date": "Dec 29, 2019", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Suganya Jothi", "user_url": "/user/show/60830284-suganya-jothi", "text": "This novel is an emotional roller -coaster. To book lovers who wants to break free from the reality and relax in a fantasy, this novel is too real and that eventually infuriates the audience and that reflects in many reviews. The novel captures the essence of father son bond which acts as a page turner. The novel also takes a stand in love, propagating true love is the willingness to let it go. the protagonist Harry Silver is selfish in his own ways and his ways of categorizing people as beautiful and ugly makes him shallow and also he is a textbook romantic kinda man and not to forget that he cheats his wife and never feels guilty about it and he hides it from possibly everyone starting from his parents,his lover and eventually his lawyer, yet, for some reason he tries to justify his actions and plays victim and every time the author tries to glorify the protagonist, he terribly fails. he is not perfect but custom made for his life with his son Pat, his father Patrick and his love Cyd and with them he seems fine and even perfect in certain circumstances.Thus making him a perfect blend of positives and negatives and perhaps,all of it is too real, thus it bothers many. The novel also plays around many real emotions like divorce, death, parenthood. The writing of Tony Parsons is impeccable, even when one dislike a certain character, one has to remember that the outburst of emotions is because of the amazing reality that is created by the author and his writing. In the end one would close the book loving the author for creating the reality within fiction and absolutely hating the reality of the novel and the characters. IF YOU ARE STILL CONFUSED WHETHER TO READ THIS NOVEL OR NOT, Let me put it bluntly, if you are willing to go against reality once again in your magical reading room, go for it. If you are too tired to reality, stay away from it because this novel is one heck of a remainder of people and emotions some of us deal in our day-to-day life.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["roller-coaster"]}, {"book_id_title": "47345.Man_and_Boy", "book_id": "47345", "book_title": "Man and Boy", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2408762835", "review_id": "2408762835", "date": "Aug 18, 2018", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Caixa Catalunia", "user_url": "/user/show/15879247-caixa-catalunia", "text": "******Contains spoilers, I guess****This is a book about a man who doesn't get anything.

When I was halfway through the book, I imagined penning this review and it started off with 'A mediocre book about a mediocre guy, who created his own conflict, and then grew up'. I think, in theory, that sums up Man and Boy quite accurately. But, once I got past the halfway mark, and felt a few jolts from my own life coincide with his, Harry Silver's, I realized this isn't all that bad. In fact, this could be pretty great, if you're massaging a few wounds. Harry Silver cheats on his wife of twelve years. And she leaves the very next day, of course she does, to get back the life she gave up to be with him. When you're trying to undo some past decisions, you can't honor a few others, too. So, their son gets left behind with Harry, no questions answered. And the book's about Harry trying to cope with this new change. He gets fired soon after. A few deaths added into the mix.

But somehow, the novel either lost its plot midway or did not give me the answers I was seeking. The effects of a divorce on a child is well described, how the children cope up with the loss of a 'family', what doubts creep up in their heads about where they would stay, how they would live, how the child is torn between loving and living with either of their parents etc. That was the part I thought was well highlighted and greatly discussed.

The book started with (SPOILER AHEAD OBVIOUSLY)Harry Silver facing a mid-life crisis with the sinking feeling that he was becoming old and no one likes losing the freedom and wildness of youth as it is. But life happens; you marry the girl who you think was out of your league, you manage to stay with her for a long time, your parents love her and you even have a son. Your wife has given up her career to take care of your son and life is smooth. But when peeking closer, you see that the spark of romance & intimacy is veiled (not to say lost)by a series of responsibilities & other things. You love your wife, you love your son. You have a perfect life. But it is obviously no more the same. You don't get it. What happened? So yeah, after one really rough & fucked up day at work, you dropped that one pretty coworker who asked for a lift and thats it; you go upstairs for a drink and fuck around. One-night stand; thats the word.Everything changes from there. The wife (Gina) leaves and then comes Pat, their beloved son. The drama happening in between didnt really caught my attention at times as I was quickly bored.. But thats real life drama. Such things happen. Harry fucking around while still loving his wife and then later on regretting & realising that he did such a fucking stupid mistake is typical of many married men in their 30s. This book is actually a mature story with real life drama. When Harry & Gina were splitting up; Gina told Harry 'I love you but I'm not in love with you.'Harry goes like: \"You love me but you're not in love with me? Whats that supposed to mean?\"Gina replies: \"Love is what's left when being in love has gone, okay? It's when you care about someone and you hope they're happy but you're not under any illusions about them. Maybe that kind of love is not exciting and passionate and all those things fade with time. All those things that you're so keen on. But in the end, it's the only kind of love that really matters.\"So, the book goes on with Harry, broken and trying hard to fix things in his life. He already lost his job and eventually got another job later but along the way, he was having a hard time esp. in regards to Pat. It was beautiful to see Harry become wise. I really felt for him. During your 30s, you dont mature, you become wiser instead. And Harry did a good job in gradually learning how to take care of Pat. Life gets sweeter and complicated after meeting Cyd, an American woman with her daughter Peggy. The intense drama illustrates how grown ups can complicate things in a relationship when they act like a 20/25 year old man. At a certain age, love obviously does not remain the same; it evolves but it's still there. Getting used to routine is what possibly makes things dull, boring and no more exciting in the relationship. Honestly, at first I hated Harry for being a typical man but later, I discovered he was only human and was hurting so much. This made me realise that loneliness is so underrated. Everyone(including men) needs some loving; it's not always about shagging. :)Finally why I gave the book 4 stars is because the few last chapters really tore me. I felt my heart pinch, seriously. Harrys dad death and Harry handing Pat over to Gina. These 2 events changed my perspective on many things. Family; the one bond of love that will last in forever terms. Everything was beautifully told. During the funeral, Harrys mom chose this song (lyrics ahead):Someday,when im awfully low,when the world is cold,I will feel a glowJust thinking of you,And the way you looked tonight.And the most beautiful lesson to end: Harrys mom - But you have to learn to let go. That's part of it, isnt it?Harry - Part of what?Harrys mom - Part of what it means to love someone. To really love someone. If you love someone then you dont just see them as an extension of yourself. You don't just love them for what's in it for you.And Harrys good old mom then had tears shining in her blue eyes.\"Love means knowing when to let go\"This was my moment of contemplation. I cherished this part most of all.And, I was happy how the story ended. It kinda tells me that there's still hope and faith in humanity.

A few months before his 30th birthday, Harry was living the American dream. He had a beautiful wife named Gina, a luxurious red MGF sports car that average men dreamt of having, he was a successful TV producer and had his own Live TV show and to top it all off he had an adorable 4 year old boy named Pat. Till now everything was perfect for Harry; he had everything a man wanted. Everything changed one night when Harry unknowingly abolished everything. One night on his TV show, they brought in a new guest and things didn\u2019t go the way Harry and his staff wanted it to. This incident gave Harry a lot of work stress which eventually led to a one night stand between Harry and his co-worker Siobhan. This changed everything for Harry, Gina found out and decided to walk out on Harry leaving him with the 4 year old Pat. Gina shifted back to Japan in hopes to become a Bank Translator. It gets worse for Harry as he loses his job and becomes an unemployed single parent. Doing everything he can to raise Pat Harry has to deal with his wife\u2019s divorce request and fight for the custody of Pat. When Gina returns from Japan, Harry and Gina agree that after Gina settles in Japan, Pat will be sent to live with his mother. Slowly everything comes together for Harry; he meets a new lady named Cyd and decided to marry her. He got a new job as TV producer for another company and managed his time between working and spending time with Pat. \tOne of the major themes represented within this book has to be the theme of love. It doesn\u2019t have to be necessarily the love between man and women; in this case it\u2019s father and son. I really enjoyed how the novel Man and Boy portrays this theme in a very detailed manner when Harry is left alone to take care of his Pat. The father son relationship grows as Harry does everything he can to raise his child. The author was very powerful while describing the setting and characters in the first few chapters. The amount of detail put in the novel made the readers experience the story firsthand. In my opinion a story that has a great description of the settings and characters establishes its greatness from the first few chapters. Man and Boy had curiosity in almost every chapter, as the reader I was excited, curious and stayed glued to my seat wanting to know what happened in the next page. \tAlthough there are a lot of positive influences in this novel, there are also negatives which shouldn\u2019t be ignored such as the ending being very fairy tale like and fake; also events in this novel happened suddenly. Normally to average humans it would take them time to get into another relationship after divorce, however Harry met a new lady and got married within a few months of his break up. This book makes it out to seem that in reality there is always a happy ending. However sometimes things don\u2019t end up in a fairy tale style ending. \tMan and Boy is a novel with a roller-coaster of emotions, describing feelings and mental thought process in an extraordinary way. The novel showcases the importance of strength within a relationship and the importance of a relationship. This novel appealed to me because of all the drama, romance and plot twists it had stored within it. The novel started of very boring and randomly took a twist making it very interesting. Personally I was satisfied with this book. If you are interested in a novel with romance, corruption, plot twists and drama, this novel will be a good read for you.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "47345.Man_and_Boy", "book_id": "47345", "book_title": "Man and Boy", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2220814706", "review_id": "2220814706", "date": "Dec 21, 2017", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Ieva Liepa", "user_url": "/user/show/70439976-ieva-liepa", "text": "Easy read.

I think I would place this book in a genre of 'emotional' writing that deals with life events that happen to a lot of people (marriage, break ups, children, death, family). Despite the main character, Harry, being male, I do think this book is predominantly aimed at a female audience. That's not to say that all women will enjoy it, or that all men wouldn't, but I feel that this genre of writing is seen as more female-oriented. The main relationships in the story are those between Harry and his father, a fairly traditional man who is tough (his tattoos are constantly mentioned), and between Harry and his young son Pat. I found that these two relationships were very well-written, emotive, and touching stories. I found that my main problems with the book came when Harry's relationships with women were discussed. His marriage breaks down early on and his wife moves to Japan. I felt that the descriptions of this felt like exactly what they were: a precursor to the author's desire to describe the father-son relationship and have a little tug on our heartstrings. I think this is why Harry's brief encounter with a colleague and his wife's discovery of it seem to cover so few pages; this seems strange in a book that deals with emotional/traumatic life events. I did not particularly enjoy this part of the book, although perhaps both Gina and Harry's actions would be more familiar and empathetic to readers who had their own children, especially if arguments surrounding custody were involved.Overall I found that the bits that really did make me cry & laugh (as the blurb/reviews promised) were the parts nearer the end between Harry and his father, perhaps because I can see parts of my own relationships with my dad/grandad in the text.

Many years ago I had cause to write to Tony Parsons after something he'd written in his newspaper column. (I can't even remember what.)

Well written and engaging, there were so many poignant moments but in addition, there was a scattering of laugh-out-loud parts too. The story around his father's funeral and the realisations it brought out in Harry were superb and highly in touch with reality - so many readers will be able to identify with such an unfortunate and inevitable part of life. The journey he goes through with his young son which ultimately leads his unselfish decision to allow his ex-wife full residency was highly touching and this will resonate strongly with any fathers out there, especially ones with broken families.There is a kind a sadness associated with the book around the fact that modern life seems to be so tolerant of married couples giving up on each other, with children often being the main victims as a result. It may seem obvious but if couples were able to see the negative impact brought upon children from separation, surely they would think twice about having them in the first place - at least until they are reasonably sure they are able to make a life together first.Harry does succumb to adultery in the form of a one night stand at the start of the book - an action which might automatically cause the reader to believe that he deserves everything he gets. However it is pretty much impossible to maintain such a feeling as we unravel his character through the story. His moral and often unselfish behaviour on multiple occasions is highly admirable. This is also supported by the fact that his wife Gina really did seem to be looking for any excuse to get away from things and live her own life.In summary, a highly enjoyable but also important read for anyone who might be considering giving up on their family.

This is the beginning of the book and it certainly did not make me warm to the main character. I cannot stand men who have a midlife crisis and need to fill their lives with something else, plus 30 is way too young for this self pitying nonsense! Also, Harry never considered that his wife might be unhappy looking after their son everyday and giving up her career. However, when Harry's wife leaves him is where the book really comes into its own. As Harry's wife heads to Japan to try and regain the life she lost, Harry is suddenly left as a single father with not much of a clue as to how to do this. This section of the book was my favourite and I loved reading the developing bond between Harry and his son. When Gina (Harry's wife) comes back four months later, I was a bit annoyed with her as she is the one who left, however, Harry's attitude began to annoy me again. Gina did all this stuff for 5 years until Harry messed it up, Harry then looks after Pat for 4 months and reckons he makes a better parent? However, Harry pulls this back by willingly giving custody to Gina and although I didn't think he would deserve it, a little bit of me was hoping for a Gina and Harry reunion!

It had a very simple rom com plot and set of characters and very few saving graces. To summarize for myself\u2026 the main character is nearing 30 and has been married for quite a while to a woman who had wanted to be a Japanese translator. They have a very cute son together. The man works for a shock-jock type TV talk show. He inexplicably sleeps with a co-worker and causes his marriage to fall apart. His wife, who had (resentfully) carried the brunt of the child-rearing responsibilities, goes off to Japan to see whether she can revive her career.
