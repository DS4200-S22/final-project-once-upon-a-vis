And the opening to Still Standing, his description of a Leeds pub, well, it's beyond belief the brewery allows that pub to be open. Makes my local look very tame in comparison.

Having read Paul O'grady: The Biography (typical British-written \"authorised biography\" stuff, style and all) I was interested to see what he had to say for himself.The tone is certainly different, as is the emphasis. I had expected a bit more elaboration of family dynamics etc, but what we get is mostly his explorations of his own sexuality, and from a very young age (confirming what me aged mum always told me, that \"it's all boys think about\" *sarcasm*). I had expected a bit more of a humourous tone than there is, or maybe it's me? Maybe the humour is scripted into the shows, and not natural to the man.I am no prude, and certainly no stranger to books like Hiding My Candy, but...this book disappointed me rather. Not that I was looking for scabrous tales of abuse and neglect, indeed--for that we have Chablis' book. But I don't know...I expected something different. Aside from his sexcapades, a lot of it is pretty surface. We are told he has a couple of siblings, but that's all; not much interaction.Will I read the other two volumes of this memoir? Remains to be seen.

I have only read a handful of books twice. This book is one of those books. I don't why, but I find Paul's life fascinating. Like me he is an animal lover.Paul takes the reader through his first eighteen years of his life, from his birth in 1955 to his dad's passing in 1973. Giving the reader an insight into how his family ended up in Birkenhead. Born on the 14th June 1955 in St Catherine's Hospital in Tranmere, his father Patrick Grady was born in Ireland, moved to England in 1936. His surname was changed by mistake to O'Grady when he joined the RAF and he kept it. He married Mary Savage (1916-88) who was born in England to Irish immigrants. Both were devout Catholics and raised their children in the faith. Paul was their third child, Sheila born in 1941 and Brendan in 1944, he was unplanned, his mother finding out about the pregnancy after visiting the doctor complaining about indigestion. Paul spent his early life at 23 Holly Grove in Higher Tranmere. Attending St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, he excelled in everything except Mathematics. His parents sent him to Redcourt, where his grades dropped. Failing his eleven plus, he couldn't go to a grammar school so was sent to the Blessed Edmund Campion Secondary Modern and the Corpus Christi High School. A fan of the Avengers and Batman, he joined the cub scouts, leaving after a month. An altar boy at a Catholic Church, he was dismissed after laughing during a funeral service. He then joined the Marine Cadets, later commenting that he was following in the footsteps of his first hero, Popeye. Enjoying the cadets, he joined the Boys Amateur Boxing Club, leading to a lifelong love of the sport. His first job was a paper round that lasted the week. Leaving school aged 16, he obtained a job in the DHSS as a clerical assistant at the Liverpool office. He also worked part time in the bar at the RAFA club in Oxton. Resigning from the DHSS, he managed to obtain a job at the Wheatsheaf Hotel in Virginia Water in Surrey. Appalled at the working conditions, the management accused him of stealing, which he denied. Returning to Birkenhead, he returned to the RAFA club, increasingly socialising with within the Liverpudlian gay scene, attending meetings of the CHE and working at the Bear's Paw, a gay bar. This he kept a secret from his parents. With best friend, Tony, he regularly travelled to London to socialise with Tony's friend, John Pritchard, the classical music conductor, becoming very fond of him. Experimenting, he had sex with friend Diane. The book ends with Paul working at Liverpool Magistrates Court, finding out that Diane is pregnant in the same week as his parents have heart attacks, after having returned from a holiday, his mother later recovering but his father passing away.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["biographies-autobiographies"]}, {"book_id_title": "4876759-at-my-mother-s-knee", "book_id": "4876759-at-my-mother-s-knee", "book_title": "At My Mother's Knee...: and other low joints", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4099187390", "review_id": "4099187390", "date": "Jul 14, 2021", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Lauren", "user_url": "/user/show/110960744-lauren", "text": "I just didn't enjoy this book very much, I thought I'd love it as I think Paul on the television is very funny but I found it underwhelming which I was disappointed by as the reviews for this book are on the whole very positive. The book focuses purely on his life from Birth to around the age of 18 and Paul's voice shines through in the writing, you can't help but read the book in his voice.I've tried to pinpoint why I didn't enjoy this book very much and I don't think it was one singular reason, more a culmination of things making it underwhelming. Firstly I never felt as though the reader got to know Paul, the first third of the book is focused on his family history and detailed description of each of his family members which was interesting but I kept wondering when Paul was going to talk about himself and his memories. He did move on to his anecdotes but they stayed heavily rooted in his surrounding family and tended to focus on their reactions and feelings to things he had done rather than focusing on himself. He rarely wrote about his own emotions and feelings but when he did so such as on the death of his Father he wrote beautifully with emotion. It showed a softer side to him compared to the one portrayed throughout the rest of the book. Secondly, there wasn't much of Paul's trademark wit in this book, there were funny moments but most of the humour came from the anecdotes featuring Paul's Mother Molly. Additionally there were a few early anecdotes which I found quite upsetting involving animal cruelty (not involving Paul himself) and I really didn't like them. Paul on the television comes across as really likeable but the Paul in this book doesn't, a lot of his actions are self-centred, potentially this is due to the book only covering his early years and most likely he matures as the books progress as there were signs of it towards the end of this book. I had already bought the next book before I had read this one so I will be reading that soon.

He is very honest too of how his relationships with his parents were and it also has a lot of humour too in that. He is very open on how he matured into adolescence and teenage years and of his experiences with both females and males. He describes the conversations with his mother and aunties etc and I could clearly hear them as I read the book and their accents and mannerisms came across clearly to me. The 1960\u2019s was a progressive time for us to grow up in and Paul describes that so well. His whole time of trying to find his feet in work is accurate and clear are his times of where things just go wrong for him and the words of his mother and father echoing to me in that same way......it made me smile......he turned out doing well for himself....and so did I.....life is like that.....so it shapes us and makes us what we are.
