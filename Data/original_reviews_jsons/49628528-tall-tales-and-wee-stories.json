And a wierd look about his face. I became instantly friendly with him. Gordon only had one eye - he'd lost the other one in a motoring accident in Spain - but that's not when we discovered it, that came later. We found that out one day when it was somebody's birthday in the pub. 'Happy birthday!' - chink-chink - 'Happy birthday! All the best!' - chink-chink - 'Yeah, happy birthday to you!' - chink-chink. And Gordon went; 'Yeah, happy birthday!' and he lifted his glass and chink-chinked it with his glass eye. We were amazed: 'Did you see that? He chinked the glass off his fucking eye!'He was a crazy bloke. He drank Guinness and when he needed to pee, he'd take his eye out and put it in the foam, because there were a lot of thieves in the pub. We called them 'mine-sweepers', because they'd go up and grab somebody else's glass, saying, 'That's mine!' Well, they'd try it with Gordon's - 'That's mine!' - and then they'd see this eye floating in the foam: 'Aaaggghhh!'Well I was walking through the pub one day, and he came in the door with his arm in a sling. I said, 'What happened to you?' He said, 'You'll never believe it. I was driving up Sauchiehill Street, I was scratching my good eye, and I ran into a bus.' He'd thought because his artificial eye was so expensive he could see through it!ABOUT 'TALL TALES AND WEE STORIES': In December 2018, after fifty years of belly-laughs, energy and outrage, Billy Connolly announced his retirement from live stand-up comedy. It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he'd worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy's routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion.Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.MY THOUGHTS: I bought this book from a small independent bookstore in Russell, northern New Zealand, when we were up there on holiday over the 2019/20 Christmas/New Year period. I love Billy Connolly and was lucky enough to see him live last time he toured New Zealand. I came out of his show with my mascara all down my face, and my sides ached for days. Billy writes exactly as he talks, so I could hear him as I was reading. Some of the stories were familiar to me, some were new. All were entertaining. No one escapes his attention. Not his wife, daughters, friends, workmates, or the scone loving, brogue, twinset and heather coloured tweed wearing elderly ladies of Scotland. If you're a Billy Connolly fan, or simply need a good laugh, this is the book you need. It has joined The World of Pooh: The Complete Winnie-The-Pooh and the House at Pooh Corner by A.A. Milne as my all time favourites. They are never put away on a shelf, but instead are always somewhere close at hand where I can pick one up and while away a few minutes, or hours. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50THE AUTHOR: William \"Billy\" Connolly, Jr., CBE is a Scottish comedian, musician, presenter and actor. He is sometimes known, especially in his native Scotland, by the nickname The Big Yin (The Big One). His first trade, in the early 1960s, was as a welder (specifically a boilermaker) in the Glasgow shipyards, but he gave it up towards the end of the decade to pursue a career as a folk singer in the Humblebums and subsequently as a soloist. In the early 1970s he made the transition from folk-singer with a comedic persona to fully-fledged comedian, a role in which he continues. He also became an actor.It is as a stand-up comedian that Connolly is best known. His observational comedy is idiosyncratic and often off-the-cuff. He has outraged certain sectors of audiences, critics and the media with his free use of the word \"fuck\". He has made jokes relating to masturbation, blasphemy, defecation, flatulence, haemorrhoids, sex, his father's illness, his aunts' cruelty and, in the latter stages of his career, old age (specifically his experiences of growing old). In 2007 and again in 2010, he was voted the greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.Connolly has been married to comedian and psychologist Pamela Stephenson since 1989. In the book Billy, and in a December 2008 online interview, Connolly states he was sexually abused by his father between the ages of 10 and 15. He believes this was a result of the Catholic Church not allowing his father to divorce after his mother left the family. Due to this, Connolly has a \"deep distrust and dislike of the Catholic church and any other organization that brainwashes people\". In a 1999 interview with \"The Sunday Herald\" Connolly condemned the SNP as \"racist\" and the new Scottish parliament as a \"joke\".In November 1998, Connolly was the subject of a two-hour retrospective entitled Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, which included tributes from Judi Dench, Sean Connery, Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, and Eddie Izzard.

For Billy Connolly is more than the sum of his parts. If you read these stories without any idea who Billy Connolly was, I suspect you would find them neither terribly interesting nor amusing. In fact, I was surprised how comically thin many of these tall tales and wee stories were. And yet some of them I think I can actually remember him telling and laughing at.I think this comes down to the fact that he is overall a brilliant performer. And to understand this brilliance you need to hear his voice, see his face, sense his energy levels when he was performing, - and so on. The words written down on paper just don't do it for me on their own - but if you add him back into them, they will. There were a few bits which were either slightly amusing or interesting, but slim pickings from a 320 or so pages long book. My advice, give this a miss.

I\u2019ve got lots of DVDs featuring his standup and travelogues, and I was lucky enough to see him live twice. He never fails to make me laugh, even just on a chat show. So it was with great sadness I heard about his retirement, although entirely understandable in his circumstances.I was looking forward to reading this book in which he has gathered many of his most famous stories for posterity. Billy never really told \u2018jokes,\u2019 they were always funny anecdotes and tales, often poking fun at himself or other absurdities he saw in every day life. He often talked about sex and bodily functions, and was very sweary and he makes no apology for that, so the book would not be for anyone who did not like this in his live shows because Billy is exactly the same in the book as when performing. If you did love his humour though, you will find many of your favourite stories within these pages.The book is split in to chapters on different, loosely connected topics, but otherwise it is fairly randomly organised with just little anecdotes and longer ones interspersed with comments, thoughts and musings on his life and career. Some people won\u2019t like it because it isn\u2019t a particular linear format, but then Billy\u2019s comedy was never like that. He would start on a topic and then wander off at a tangent when other things occurred to him before looping back round to the original story (or sometimes not!), so the book is a good reflection of his style and really brought him to life for me.I could hear his voice telling these familiar, and some unfamiliar, stories very clearly. Parts of it made me laugh out loud and I had to keep stopping to read bits aloud to The Irishman who kept asking me what I was laughing at. It was a book that really cheered me up during this lockdown. However, it is not the same as watching Billy perform, and you realise how much his expressions and gestures and movements added to the comedy of his story-telling. The \u2018Wildebeest\u2019 example illustrates this best.

There are a few great stories but most of them are anything but; the fact that I knew most of them wasn't the problem as I can listen to him on YouTube indefinitely (in fact, I would take an audio recordings of his comedy onto my desert island).If only the publisher's had had the courage to be honest it could have made for a much better book; they could have had a preface by the editor who transcribed the material with a related commentary; or, if Billy actually did this mundane task himself, surely he'd say something about it in the intro. I've transcribed audio material before and it's really hard work, as is the editing that has to then follow.There's no clue on the cover or front matter about who did the dirty work but in the acknowledgements the first name to get a thank you (and his own sentence) is Nick Davies. Who is Nick Davies? I will ask Google right now ... it turns out he's a bigshot editor who's worked for some of the main London publishing houses. I assume he's too high and mighty to have done this transcribing task himself (maybe Billy actually did it?. Maybe one of his household minions?) What I do know is that publishers will sell their own mother to get their hands on a book by a celebrity of Billy's stature, as it's like making a sequel of a popular film -- there's a ready-made audience ready to buy it however indifferent its quality may be.This is what Nick Davies said in The Bookseller's puff piece about the book:\u201cAs his many millions of fans will know, Billy\u2019s stories can be rude, warm-hearted, anarchic, joyful, angry, far-fetched, down-to-earth and everything in between. They are also beautifully constructed, brilliantly paced and deeply funny. I\u2019ve written to Billy at various points over the last 15 years to ask if he would bring these stories to the printed page and I\u2019m thrilled that he has finally agreed. Tall Tales is an absolute treat of a book that will delight readers everywhere.\u201dIn conclusion, it's important to get Billy's jokes in book form -- particularly for people like me of a Scottish persuasion.

So I was surprised to find myself disturbed by his liberal use of the F word right from the start of his book. In fact on the first page he actually says if you don\u2019t like the F word you can F off right now. Of course this might be because my ten year old granddaughter bought the book for me at Christmas and wants to borrow it, so maybe I was just a prudish grandad being over protective. Anyway, once I got over that hurdle I drove Jennifer mad with sudden outbursts of raucous laughter that got me confined to the conservatory, and I realised I wasn\u2019t actually reading the book - I was hearing Connolly saying it loud and clear in my head as he strutted up and down the stage. Of course the stories are the same ones he\u2019s told many times before, but as some comic used to say, it\u2019s the way he tells them. Having been brought up on the west coast of Ireland in a small terrace house with outside toilet, three brothers and four sisters, I can relate to Connolly\u2019s stories of his childhood in Glasgow. The story of the kid in bed shouting down that Eamon has his foot stuck in the sleeve of the overcoat, and the mortified mother shouting back in front of the visiting priest that it isn\u2019t an overcoat, it\u2019s an eiderdown had done the rounds in our town long before Connolly made us howl with laughter at it. I was even slapped around the head one evening by an inebriated neighbour who thought I was one of his and I should be at home in bed. Great days.

Others were probably as funny, but I had either heard them before on old recordings of his gigs (on LPs - yes I am that old) and his TV appearances, or read them in his earlier \"Unauthorised Biography\". His material was never politically correct, even in the days before such a thing was unheard of... he always navigated the line of what was \"acceptable/shocking\" frequently crossing it...

He was never a \"political\" comedian... he usually found humour in the ridiculous, and especially the ridiculous that we accept as normal. However, some of his later material, perhaps in the light of the PC/woke climate and the reaction against that by some, comes across as lazily reactionary. He sees the PC/woke agenda as \"beige\" but instead of taking on substantial examples of this he focusses on reversing beepers on bin-lorries and ambulance being printed back to front on the front of said vehicles.

Many of the stories involve rants that become increasingly amusing, and every story ends with some sort of punch line, but, as Billy himself says, he dose not actually tell jokes, he makes his stories amusing.For those not familiar with Billy Connolly, a word of warning. Billy believes that Keith Tynan did the English language, and television, a great service by being the first person to ever use the F word on television. According to Billy this was a liberating event, so much so, that he enjoys using that word quite liberally in both his stage appearances and this book.

The kind of laugh that makes everyone else around you smile, even though they have no idea what the joke is. Well, this gem from the master raconteur Billy Connolly will have you cackling like a hyena on almost every page. Nobody, and I mean nobody, tells stories like Billy Connolly. And this collection, curated from the thousands he\u2019s told on stage, is the best of the best. Many of them you will have heard in one version or another. Here, they are retold almost as transcripts of a live performance, complete with all the weird and wonderful diversions and exclamations he\u2019s famous for. And, amazingly, the essence of Billy Connolly is so well contained in these pages, that you cannot help but hear his voice in your head as you read. No matter whether you\u2019re Scottish or not, this is a book that demands to be read in a broad Glaswegian accent. Billy\u2019s genius is that he views life through an unfiltered lens. He talks about what he sees and asks the questions that nobody else would dare. He speaks with unabashed candor about anything and everything. No subject is taboo, his observations on people and life shrewd and relentlessly funny. I\u2019m so happy to have all these wonderful anecdotes collated and saved for posterity. This is a book I will return to time and again whenever I need a pick-me-up. And it\u2019s one I\u2019d highly recommend to each and every Big Yin fan.
