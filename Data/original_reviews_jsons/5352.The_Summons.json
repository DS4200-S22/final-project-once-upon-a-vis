It was like I was able to sit down and visit with an old friend. Perhaps some other readers confused this familiarity with boredom. It all starts when law professor Ray Atlee and his prodigal brother, Forrest, are summoned home by their ailing father to settle his estate. But, by the time Ray arrives, his father is already dead. The will is simple enough: the estate is to be divided equally between the two sons. However, Ray discovers something he hadn't planned on-- $3 million in cash stashed in the father's house. It turns out that Ray isn't the only one who knows about this fortune; someone else is after the money and won't hesitate to remove Ray from the picture. The remainder of the book is devoted to investigating the source of the cash and trying to discover who the other party is that wants it. Some better proofreading would have made this an easier book to read since there are some glaring errors that should have been caught. But, all in all, an enjoyable, suspensful book.

The Summons. New York: Random House.A lawyer in Mississippi finds three million dollars in cash in his father\u2019s house after the old man dies. The money is not mentioned in the will, and indeed there is no obvious way the judge could have amassed that much cash. Should the lawyer declare it to the IRS and lose half in taxes, as the law requires, or quietly split it with his no-good, loser, drug-addict brother who would probably use it to overdose, or should he just stuff it into the trunk of his car and keep quiet? Choice number three, obviously. But threatening notes appear, followed by break-ins and fires. Somebody knows about the money and wants it.That is a pretty good set up, because it\u2019s a nice fantasy everyone has had, finding a hoard of cash, and a good question, what would you do with it, with respect to the law, with respect to family, and especially, what would you do if your life was threatened by having the loot? But the choices for a novel are more restricted than that. We can\u2019t have the protagonist just buy houses, cars, and airplanes, because that\u2019s not interesting. We can\u2019t have him give half to the IRS, because that just rubs greed the wrong way. We could have him split it with his brother, but, again, that goes against the greed motive, and also, maybe he really does care about his irresponsible brother. But, he has to do something with it. He cannot just drive around the south with the money in the back of his Audi for two hundred pages. What fun is that? But that\u2019s what happens. The promise of the premise is not fulfilled. If the writing were lyrical and insightful, we might not care that the plot has the dynamism of a slug crossing a garden. But the writing is only pedestrian, and also pretty clearly written by a committee. The plot wanders here and there, as if nobody were in charge of directing it, and the ending is incomplete and arbitrary. There obviously was no overall outline of the plot. It was the old, make it up as you go method.I got the book on a remainder table and I thought I\u2019d see exactly how he works his magic. Unfortunately, there is no magic, other than the fact of the author\u2019s name. I did make a couple of useful observations. One is that the writing is spare, competent, and kinetic, with few digressions into scenery, costumes, or characters\u2019 interiors. That is the formula that sells, apparently.Also there were a couple of well-wrought moments of chilling suspense, when the protagonist receives threatening notes that reveal the pursuer\u2019s intimate knowledge of his movements and motives. The idea that someone is watching you that closely is frightening. It might have worked even better if the narrative had been first-person and the main character a little more reflective. This narrator is third-person, close in to the main character, but overall, an inert narrator.I would have enjoyed a paranoid, fear-soaked cat-and-mouse chase, or maybe some clever turn-the-tables plotting, or even, since it\u2019s Grisham, some tricky legal maneuvers. But there is just nothing going on here. It\u2019s a Grisham novel for the sake of a Grisham novel, and there is no literary or artistic reason for it to exist.

When he finds his father dead in the study, Ray discovers a sum of over $3 million in the house, money which is not part of Judge Atlee's will. Ray immediately thinks the money is \"dirty\" because his father could not possibly have made so much money in his career.Assuming that he is the only one who knows about the money, Ray decides to take it without making it officially part of the estate, and does not tell anyone about it: he knows that if he made it a part of the estate, taxes would take most of the money.

I guess the problem with this book is that nothing much happens in the first half--it is very slow and takes a long time to really get off the ground. The story is about two brothers that have led very different lives. One is a responsible professor of law and the other has spent most of his adult life checking in and out of drug rehab facilities. Their father is a prominent and powerful figure but has complicated relationships with his sons. The sons receive an unexpected and unusual summons to visit their highly respected father. They arrive to find that they are too late, dad has died. But why is there three million dollars in cash hidden in the house?This is probably the best novel I have read that demonstrates the allure and power of money when it gets a grip of a person's soul. Sitting on the concrete floor with three million dollars strewn around him, he finally admitted how important the money had become. The real horror of last night had been the chance of losing it. Now he was afraid to leave it....In the past few weeks he had become more curious about how much things cost, about what the money could buy, about how it could grow if invested conservatively, or aggressively. At times, he thought of himself as wealthy, and then he would dismiss those thoughts. But they were always there, just under the surface and popping up with greater frequency....One by one the options were being eliminated. He might be forced to keep it himself.The problem with money and material things is the more we have of them, the more we want. Our hearts will never be satisfied and we will never have enough. Yet, ironically, the more things we have, the more stressed we feel as we are compelled to think about them. It is one of the biggest lies of the enemy to make us think that if only we had this amount of money or that item or that person's lifestyle we would be happy. Not so. The grass will always be greener and we will just become more and more dissatisfied with what we have. Another factor is that we appreciate things more if we have had to work for them. We value them more because they cost us more to get them. Being spoiled by someone or winning a large amount of money won't bring the happiness that might be expected. God is the source of all good gifts and He is the one who allows us to enjoy them.....Life is about people, relationships, faith (God) and not about things!This novel is worth reading due to the principles it highlights about material wealth and the dangers and pitfalls. It is not especially exciting or dramatic although I definitely didn't guess the twist at the end. It plods along describing the gradual corruption that money can bring to a person's heart and mind leading to a loss of control and willingness to to do things that are out of character.There is a small amount of bad language, there are no sex scenes and nothing particularly violent.

Obviously his name and rep make it a best seller regardless - the book's been out a little while, which is why a bazillion people have weighed in. Indeed, at first, we were captivated and entertained, almost in the style of The Firm or The Partner. Grisham sinks a hook early with the discovery of three million in cold hard cash by law professor Ray Atlee in his dead father's house. He hides it before Forrest Atlee, his ne'er-do-well younger brother, either in addiction or rehab from booze and drugs virtually his whole adult life, gets to the house in answer to a deathbed summons from Father, who wound up unexpectedly dead on arrival. While the new will (subject of the summit meeting) included the previously disowned Forrest, the estate was little more than the house without the cache of cash!What follows is a somewhat humorous and rather suspenseful \"won the lottery\" story as Ray frets over what to do with all that cash physically, where he hides it, what he does to discover its origin, etc. Then he starts getting notes that one person also knows about the money, at which point Ray is hassled and followed at every turn as he tries to figure out who knows and what to do about it. So far, we're turning the pages pretty rapidly, with not much book left. Then suddenly, all becomes obvious, and here's where it all goes sour - too many clues prematurely reveal the \"mystery\", with a terribly silly ending that will please no one.No doubt Grisham is to the point where his books receive little editorial criticism or revision, and there's probably few wanting to risk tweaking his money machine. But somebody needed to fix the last quarter of this story to give us the great tale we know Grisham can produce at his best. Without that, this one goes in his also-rans.

In this case, one totally expected a son's opinion about his father to change. This would impact his further view on what to do about the money.

Take Ray's colleagues or the lawyers or the people he knows. Women are either assistants or eye candy but overall they are just paper cut figures. So all the important deeds, according to John Grisham, are done by men in the world. This kind of scenario - when the author makes long winded efforts to depict authenticity and make accurate descriptions - strikes you as weird to say the least. At least one women lawyer or professor would have been more natural. But we see females only as secretaries or students lusting after Ray. Well, really!The narrative is poor and too much detailed.

Worse kinds of stories, in my opinion, are those you bear on with just for the sake of knowing how they end and for the shame of quitting after you have gone that far. \"The Summons\" perfectly qualifies as one; it starts all promising, the suspense is building up, the main characters are getting gradually unfolded, and it seems that a lot more excitement is heading on the way. But as you reach the middle, it looks as if you are apparently stuck with endless details and worthless redundant events, which only seems to me as an excuse for reaching a target number of pages! However, reaching the final part, you find the events rushing up again, but unfortunately not enough to make up for or exceed the excessive boredom haunting you all through the middle chapters. This is my first time with Grisham though, I have watched a bunch of the movies, but never read any of the novels. It would be unfair to not mention that the main story is a captivating one, and except for the unnecessary lingering in the middle, the ending would have had a stronger impact.

This all changed when a little book called \"The Summons\" came my way. It was published back in 2002, but that did not deter me at all. Since Grisham is one of the most popular authors ever, it only made sense to get to know him as a reader by starting off with \"The Summons\", and it made for a good, not great, introduction to his work.\"The Summons\" is about a lawyer named Ray Atlee, who (along with his drug-addict brother Forrest) receives a summon from his father Judge Atlee to return to his childhood home in Clanton, Mississippi to discuss the will. Upon arrival, Ray discovers that not only the judge is dead, but also over $3 million in cash that was not previously accounted for. While Ray tries to figure out where his dad got the money from, another person knows about the cash and makes veiled threats against Ray because of it.The book definitely grabbed my attention in the beginning with the main characters\u2019 back stories and the moment that Ray discovers the money. However, my interest varied throughout the novel. For example, Ray spends a good portion of the first half gambling the found cash to see if his father managed to get them that way. This would have made sense if he did this for a chapter or two, but no, this gambling goes on for multiple chapters. Luckily, I became intrigued again when Ray starts receiving the photographs indicating that someone else knows about the money too. But it waned again when Ray was meeting with minor characters to talk about where the money really came from. I realized that whenever something happened, it held my interest, yet when there was a lot of talking, it did not hold it as much. And that depended on what they were talking about. I get that there is a lot of legal speak, which I am not fluent in, but whenever the subject turned to the money, I was all ears.Speaking of the money, readers and reviewers alike have noticed that everything revolved around it in this novel. Characters \u2013 major and minor \u2013 can\u2019t stop talking about it, but then again, when someone finds a lot of money, it will weigh heavily on their minds for days, weeks, and even months on end. As a result, I didn\u2019t mind that Grisham made the it the most interesting character in the novel with perfectly good stakes around it.And yes, there is a twist at the end that definitely threw me for a loop. I will not spoil it, but I will say this: the twist makes the story a cautionary tale about how people use money. Too bad the story had to end abruptly after that. Overall, \"The Summons\" is a good, not fantastic, introduction to John Grisham. It contains characters that people can be intrigued by and a really interesting turn at the end. Also, no one can go wrong with finding tons of cash. At the same time, I can\u2019t help but notice the parts that dragged on and how it ended suddenly. I would recommend it to people who are either John Grisham lovers or want to get into his work. Either way, people will like it for the most part.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "5352.The_Summons", "book_id": "5352", "book_title": "The Summons", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3077039246", "review_id": "3077039246", "date": "Dec 08, 2019", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Leandro Napoles", "user_url": "/user/show/97732171-leandro-napoles", "text": "I had just finished Moby Dick and thought that I would look around the house for something interesting to read. In one of my drawers, I found a bunch of Grisham books that I had bought at a garage sale months ago and never read. Unfortunately, I picked this one first. Compared to some of my favorite books, the writing style in \"The Summons\" is lackluster and simplistic. I found a few grammatical errors in the early pages, but nothing too extreme. The small-town atmosphere present in some parts of the novel was interesting, and perhaps well done, but this is pretty much all of the praise that I'd give the book. Now, onto the worst element of the book: the plot. Spoilers: The only three characters that matter in this book are Ray Atlee, a professor of law at a prestigious university and a sad man whose wife left him for a millionaire; Forrest Atlee, an addict to every drug you can think of who has bounced from rehab center to rehab center for more than twenty years; and their father, who is mostly referred to as \"the judge\" since he served as a judge in the small town of Clanton for over 30 years. At the beginning of the novel, both Ray and Forrest get a summon note bearing the signature of their father with the purpose of discussing his will. Ray doesn't really want to go but he knows that he should since his father is suffering from cancer and diabetes, and doesn't have much time left. When he gets to his father's house, he lets himself in since his father never locked his door. Therein, he finds that his father has died of what he presumes to be a morphine overdose. Near his father, he finds a will that names him the executor of his father's estate and proclaims that both Forrest and Ray should share the bounty of the estate 50/50. Ray starts looking around the house and finds 27 boxes full of cash, with a total of a little bit more than 3.1 million dollars. Ray reasons that the money, if real, must either have been won by his father through gambling or through illicit deals as a Judge since his father could not possibly have made that much money in his lifetime any other way. A while later, Forrest arrives and, due to greed and possible concern that his brother would kill himself with the money by purchasing too many drugs, Ray decides to withhold the existence of the 3.1 million dollars from Forrest. Ray decides to stay at his father's house for the night in order to safeguard the money, while Forrest goes out to drink after many months of sobriety, much to Ray's chagrin. That night, Ray hears an intruder trying to open the door from the outside, which Ray had locked earlier, and ends up throwing a glass pitcher at the door which scares the intruder away. Long story short: this is the start of Ray's frantic efforts to keep the money for himself and to escape his pursuers. Though, Ray doesn't do a very good job at it as he originally didn't even want to carry a gun, and did not think of the possibility that his car was tapped with a tracking device. It is later revealed that the money was given to the Judge by a corrupt millionaire named Patton French as a reward for how the Judge had ruled in a case that had made French very wealthy. The judge was reticent to keep the money but ended up stashing it in his closet. French tells Ray, on his private yacht, that his pursuers are most likely French's former henchman who want to steal the money from Ray. After his meeting with French, Ray travels back to his father's house, with the money stashed in his car, and decides to unload the money in the house and to stay the night there. That night, an attack on Ray begins from his pursuers who throw bricks through the window with notes attached to them telling Ray to leave the money in the house and to leave quickly. Ray decides that enough is enough and leaves the money in the house and escapes to safety. A few days later, French calls Ray and tells him that his former henchman had been eliminated as threats just a while after he left French's yacht. This astounds Ray because it means that French was wrong after all and that it had not been his former henchmen who were after the 3.1 million dollars. Anyways, Ray's life quickly goes back to normal once he no longer has to protect the money. While in Clanton, one of Ray's old friends tells him that he had seen Forrest with the Judge a few days before the Judge died. This gets Ray thinking, and he starts suspecting that Forrest had had contact with their father before Ray found him dead and that Forrest might have known about the money. Therefore, he travels to the rehabilitation center that Forrest had been at for his drug addiction and confronts Forrest. In this exchange, Forrest tells him that he was indeed behind everything and that he had hired two of his friends to harass Ray in order to take the money from him. Forrest had been with the Judge when he died and had helped him administer the morphine that the judge overdosed on since the Judge was in incredible pain. Forrest had known about the money, had written the summons himself, and had forged the Judge's will that split their father's estate 50/50 and that had made Ray the executor of their father's estate. Apparently, Forrest expected Ray to split the 3.1 million with him, and got angry when Ray decided to keep the money for himself. Ray finishes his conversation with Forrest and leaves the rehabilitation center.Here's why the plot is garbage:The stupidity of the characters is absolutely astounding. As I mentioned before, Ray is an idiot who did not even initially want to carry a gun and did not consider that his car was being tracked. Vast swathes of this book, which I did not mention in my summary, are about Ray's experiences in various casinos as he tries to ascertain if his father won the money in them and if the money was even real. Another chunk of the book is dedicated to his hobby of flying airplanes. These two gigantic swathes of the book are essentially fluff added to make it longer, they do not add anything to the story, they only make it more boring. Perhaps the DUMBEST character in the entire book, though, is Forrest. If Forrest had stayed at his father's house and waited for Ray to get there, and then showed him their dead father and the 3.1 million dollars, telling him that they would split it evenly, there would have been NO conflict in this book at all. It is never explained why Forrest did not tell Ray about the 3.1 million dollars at the beginning of the book. After all, Forrest himself stated that he thought that Ray would evenly split it; why didn't Forrest approach Ray himself about splitting it instead of expecting Ray to split it? I honestly can't believe how contrived this plot is, this has to be one of the worst pieces of fiction that I've ever read.

Now the judge is a shadow of his former self, a sick, lonely old man who has withdrawn to his sprawling ancestral home. Knowing the end is near, Judge Atlee has issued a summons for his two sons to return to Clanton to discuss his estate. Ray Atlee is the eldest, a Virginia law professor, newly single and still enduring the aftershocks of a surprise divorce. Forrest is Ray's younger brother, who redefines the notion of a family's black sheep.The summons is typed by the judge himself, on his handsome old stationery, and gives the date and time for Ray and Forrest to appear in his study. Ray reluctantly heads south to his hometown, to the place where he grew up and now prefers to avoid. But the family meeting does not take place. The judge dies too soon, and in doing so leaves behind a shocking secret known only to Ray.And perhaps someone else.ReviewThe main character, Ray Atlee, is a law professor with a good salary at the University of Virginia. He has a brother, Forrest, and a father, known to many as Judge Reuben V. Atlee. Ray is sent to his father's house in Clanton, Mississippi, to discuss issues regarding the old man's will and estate. To do this, Ray has to go to fictional Ford County (Mississippi), the setting for two of John Grisham's other books including A Time To Kill. When he finds his father dead in the study, Ray discovers a sum of over three million dollars in the house, money which is not part of Judge Atlee's will. Ray immediately thinks the money is \"dirty\" because his father could not possibly have made so much money in his career.Assuming that he is the only one who knows about the money, Ray decides to take it without making it officially part of the estate, and does not tell anyone about it: he knows that if he made it a part of the estate, taxes would take most of the money. But later reality proves otherwise. Ray is being followed; someone else knows about the money. After his own investigations into the roots of the money and the identity of his shadow\u2014including trips to casinos and shady meetings with prominent southern lawyers\u2014he eventually discovers that Forrest has the money. He finds Forrest in a drug rehab compound and confronts him. At the end both part, with Forrest telling Ray that he will contact him in a year. Ray seems normal enough, his brother Forrest is a drug addict. Both are described very well. It's really interesting to follow how Ray changes when he decides what to do with the money. Cash changes people.Great book, great characters, excellent plot, and a great ending. There are times when I don't care for the unresolved way that Grisham ends his books, but this one had an excellent ending. Though the book does involved some characters from the legal profession, this book is more about money, greed, and family dynamics.

Some of his books I really liked; others have been less entertaining. This one is excellent and doesn\u2019t even have a murder. Ruben Atley was a highly respected judge. He had two sons: Ray and Forrest. Ray was a legal ethics professor at the University of Virginia making a good salary; Forrest had been a serious thorn in the judge\u2019s side since adolescence and wandered from one rehab program to another trying to kick assorted addictive habits. Ray gets a call from his father asking him to come to Mississippi right away. Knowing the judge has terminal cancer and has been in great pain for several months, Ray leaves right away only to arrive at the family\u2019s old house in time to find the judge had died on the couch in his office. On the desk was a holographic will leaving everything to his two sons and making Ray the executor. Ray calls the appropriate authorities and then, while waiting for his brother to arrive, goes through the house and the judge\u2019s papers in preparation for the will\u2019s probate. The judge had been meticulous in his records, keeping track of all his cases, and had been in the habit of giving away what little money he had to assorted good causes. There had never been even the whiff of a scandal who had a sterling reputation. So it came as a huge shock for Ray to discover $3,000,000 in $100 bills stacked neatly in stationery boxes behind the sofa. Not knowing what to think or do, Ray bags up the money and hides it in the trunk of his car. He didn\u2019t want to sully the reputation of his father, but there seemed to be nothing other than a sordid explanation for such a huge amount of cash.  There\u2019s a snag. Someone else knows about the money and leaves threatening messages ordering him to return the cash to its hiding place. Ray decides to find out if the money is counterfeit or marked in some way so he takes it back to Virginia in his car, driving very carefully, I might add. He\u2019s assured of the money\u2019s legitimacy after using some of it to gamble with and by surreptitiously and duplicitously checking with the Treasury Department. He hides the money in fireproof boxes in storage sheds, possessively and obsessively checking on it almost hourly. He does not tell his brother of the find, rationalizing that Forrest would only blow it up his nose anyway. As the notes continue, he begins to worry he is being followed, so he hires a detective to watch his back, but evidence of the watcher(s) continues unabated. He loads the money back into the trunk of his car and decides to find out where the money could have come from.  I hate giving anything away, so I\u2019ll only reveal that it involves a huge tort case, the judge is squeaky clean, the brothers\u2019 relationship gets more interesting and complex, no one gets murdered, and the ending involves a comeuppance that is quite satisfactory", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["mysteries-and-thrillers"]}, {"book_id_title": "5352.The_Summons", "book_id": "5352", "book_title": "The Summons", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3051697125", "review_id": "3051697125", "date": "Dec 05, 2019", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Michele", "user_url": "/user/show/7571294-michele", "text": "I struggled to get through this one because, while the beginning and end were interesting, I found the middle to be like watching paint dry.

There's no court battle here or the kind of case that would attract the media and lead to people forming teams in support of one brother over the other. And you know what, I respect that! As a Writer, you'll have fans love and detest some of your books, but it is very rare to have them understand your characters, and that's what this book expects of a reader. There's nothing special about the characters, they are people you'd pass by on the streets. And Grisham does not attempt to make them extraordinary, he just works on one brother's desire to have his opinion matter, and this leads you in a wild goose chase with the other brother in trying to figure things out. Envy is one of the motives in any crime, and it builds up when it's fueled. In this story you have Forrest who was the addict, and would not inherit anything from his father's estate. He decides to change things, to write up a new will and see how his perfect brother, Ray, would do.

The story moved along clearly (although slowly), and I was interested in the outcome. The plot ended in a twist that brought some symmetry to the the story and stimulated a little thinking about who is right and who is wrong, and about who is the more ethical (or less unethical) brother. So I enjoyed The Summons and may reach for Grisham in the future. That said, I didn't find great literature here. The plot is thin with numerous sports car trips back and forth without much progress, and the writing limps along just above pedestrian. Two people strongly opposed to one another over many years reconcile within a brief conversation; a love interest is just a tease and goes no where; and the rich class action lawyer is more caricature than character.

The book advances slowly and does not have a definite, clear plot, but rather is a slow-advancing mystery about the three million dollars in cash, which was fine with me.

He's forty-three, newly single, and still enduring the aftershocks of a surprise divorce. He has a younger brother, Forrest, who redefines the notion of a family's black sheep.\nAnd he has a father, a very sick old man who lives alone in the ancestral home in Clanton, Mississippi. He is known to all as Judge Atlee, a beloved and powerful official who has towered over local law and politics for forty years. No longer on the bench, the Judge has withdrawn to the Atlee mansion and become a recluse.\nWith the end in sight, Judge Atlee issues a summons for both sons to return home to Clanton, to discuss the details of his estate. It is typed by the Judge himself, on his handsome old stationery, and gives the date and time for Ray and Forrest to appear in his study.\nRay reluctantly heads south, to his hometown, to the place where he grew up, which he prefers now to avoid. But the family meeting does not take place. The Judge dies too soon, and in doing so leaves behind a shocking secret known only to Ray.\nAnd perhaps someone else.\nBONUS: This edition includes an excerpt from John Grisham's The Litigators.\n   Amazon.com Review \n  Law professor Ray Atlee and his prodigal brother, Forrest, are summoned home to Clanton, Mississippi, by their ailing father to discuss his will. But when Ray arrives the judge is already dead, and the one-page document dividing his meager estate between the two sons seems crystal clear. What it doesn't mention, however, is the small fortune in cash Ray discovers hidden in the old man's house--$3 million he can't account for and doesn't mention to brother Forrest, either.\nRay's efforts to keep his find a secret, figure out where it came from, and hide it from a nameless extortioner, who seems to know more about it than he does, culminate in a denouement with an almost biblical twist. It's a slender plot to hang a thriller on, and in truth it's not John Grisham's best in terms of pacing, dramatic tension, and interesting characters (except for Harry Rex, a country lawyer who was the judge's closest friend and in many ways is the father Ray wishes he'd had. He's so vivid he jumps off the page). But Grisham's legions of fans are likely to enjoy The Summons even if it lacks the power of some of his classic earlier books, like The Firm, The Brethren, and The Testament. --Jane Adams\n   From Publishers Weekly \n  Beck offers a fine performance in this no-frills production of Grisham's latest, despite its lack of overall narrative zip. University of Virginia law professor Ray Atlee stumbles upon more than $3 million in cash in the rural Mississippi house of his dead father, then tries to discover the source of the money and elude an increasingly persistent and menacing extortionist. Beck is a dynamic reader and excels at tackling the challenge of capturing the characters' Southern twang in the story's dialogue. Ray's voice is refined and authoritative, while that of his black sheep brother, Forrest, carries a slight crack that befits a person lacking in confidence and maturity. Family friend and local lawyer Harry Rex stands out the most, and Beck also deftly portrays a smarmy, boozing Delta attorney who calls himself the \"King of the Torts.\" But even with these intriguing, well-rounded characters and a nice evocation of the legal system's more unsavory machinations, the plot won't move listeners to the edge of their seats. Beck, however, does well with what he has, which is a decently written but rather sluggish tale of suspense with a quirky cast and one good twist at the end.

After being, forced from the bench, he is now leading a life of withdrawn recluse. With his end fast approching, the old man decides to send one final summon - to his two children, Ray Atlee and Forrest Atlee.Ray is professor of law at University of Virginia and at forty-three is fighting to come to terms with his astonishing divorce with his wife Vicki. Judge Atlee looked upon Ray to take over his mantle and rule over Clanton, but when Ray moved over to Virginia, the Judge banished him from his altar.Forrest, the younger of the two, was the black sheep of the family, indulging in all the activities that are a no-no to any decent family.Drugs, women, drinks you name it and he is into it. After numerous trips to rehabilitation funded by Judge Atlee, Forrest is finally banished from the family and is now on his own.So, Ray decides to heed to the final summon and go and meet the dying man. But before Ray reaches, the old is already dead. More surprisingly, the old man has left an unbelievable amount of money that Ray accidently stumbles on. This money, though has no mention in the old man\u2019s will which surprises Ray as the old man never put a foot against the law.So where did all this money come from? How did he manage to hide it from the law?Just as Ray is engrossed on these problems, things start happening around him. He finds somebody trying to stalk him, giving warnings and threats.So now Ray is on the run with millions of unaccounted dollars, not knowing where the money came from, who is behind the money and why is he being stalked.Critical ReviewThe plot is an interesting one and has many possibilities. But, John Grisham, disappoints to the hilt in this novel. The story takes too long to develop. For the first 15-20 chapters the story remains stagnant on details of Judge Atlee\u2019s charity retold umpteen times, Ray\u2019s divorce discussed umpteen times, Forrest\u2019s drug habits discussed umpteen times without the story ever moving forward.Then finally, when the story begins to move, it. ends as abruptly. The few mysteries that needed to be answered in the novel turn out to such letdowns that you loose the pull to go on to complete the novel at times. The climax has a small sting in tale, but when we have waited so long for the story to develop, that is the least we expect from the story.There are huge sections that are repetitive and could have been avoided. It seems more like Grisham was given an assignment, that you need to write 350 pages of a novel, do it in any manner possible!! And he did it with repetitions.Again even though there are very limited characters in this novel, the characterizations are very superficial. Each person\u2019s personal life has been examined, but the characters have been loosely developed. Also there is a huge amount of inconsistency in the characters especially Forrest\u2019s.After reading, Grisham\u2019s The Client, The Firm and The Pelican Brief, I am convinced that this is the worst novel of the lot. Let\u2019s hope he moves on from this one and goes back to the original quality.SummaryThe Summons is a forgettable novel by Grisham. The plot has lot of potential, but his story writing and plot development makes it a dull and drab read. For those of you who are planning to read this book, my suggestion is either look for one of Grisham\u2019s other novels like The Client, The Firm or The Pelican Brief or go for Dan Brown\u2019s Da Vinci Code, if you have not read it.A dismal 1 star rating for this dismal offering from John Grisham", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "5352.The_Summons", "book_id": "5352", "book_title": "The Summons", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3887990973", "review_id": "3887990973", "date": "Mar 13, 2021", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Josh Olds", "user_url": "/user/show/6256485-josh-olds", "text": "Ford County, Mississippi, was the setting for Grisham\u2019s debut novel, A Time to Kill. And while Grisham has now returned to those roots time and time again by now, 2002\u2019s The Summons was the first time we\u2019d heard anything of the area or its inhabitants for well over a decade. Interestingly, of all people, Grisham chooses to focus on Judge Reuben Atlee. Atlee presided over the trial in A Time to Kill (and has returned in more recent Grisham novels), but The Summons is set in the present\u2014and after Atlee\u2019s untimely demise. Ray, Reuben\u2019s son, has been summoned to his father\u2019s home for the express purpose of discussing the good judge\u2019s estate. He arrives to find his father dead in his study with $3 million cash hidden in the house. Knowing that there\u2019s absolutely no way his father could have made or invested that much money in any traditional means\u2014a suspicion lent credence by the fact that the money is not in Reuben\u2019s will\u2014Ray wrestles with the money\u2019s origin and his desire to keep it.Over the course of the novel, Ray tries to solve the mystery of the money but soon discovers that someone else knows about the cash\u2014someone intent on having it. After languishing for about three-quarters of the novel, the action hits a frenetic pace as Ray tries to escape with the money, narrow misses being killed, and finally solves the mystery but loses the cash.The end twist of who is chasing him is both telegraphed heavily throughout the novel, sloppily executed, and thoroughly uninteresting. Characters\u2014Ray chief among them\u2014make bonkers decisions based on absolutely no reason other than it furthering the plot. The actual story is thin, at best, as most of the novel is simply Ray trying to hide the money while trying to figure out where it came from. The problem is that \u201cWhere did the money come from?\u201d is not the most interesting question for the moment. How is Ray going to hide the money? How is he going to launder it? How is going to spend it? How is he going to get away with this new life of crime? What would the ramifications be if he called in the police? None of this is brought up. Instead, Grisham merely uses a dead judge who received an obscene amount of money for unknown reasons to set up an uninteresting mystery capped by an uninteresting heist. It would have been a poor use of new characters, but it\u2019s an abysmal use of Judge Reuben Atlee, a character now appearing in several Grisham novels, because I now know how that story arc is going to end.With such a disappointing return to Ford County, I\u2019m glad that Grisham finally returned in substance with later Jake Brigance novels. The Summons just doesn\u2019t hit: there\u2019re problems with plotting, problems with pacing, and the story surrounds a well-known character that doesn\u2019t fit the character or expand on his past.

It takes place in Clanton Mississippi in 2002 and features the Altee brothers, Ray and Forest and their now deceased father, Judge Reuben V. Altee also known simply as The Judge. The story starts out when the two brothers have been summoned to their childhood home in Clanton Mississippi to discuss their fathers will. Ray then appears on time and comes to find his father dead on the couch. It appeared as if he had overdosed on morpheme. Ray then finds the new will which states that everything in the estate will be divided equally between the two sons. After doing a little searching around the house, Ray decides to open up a cabinet to which he finds a large sum on cash, $3m to be exact. Ray decides he needs to keep this a secret in order to protect his alcoholic and drug addicted brother Forest from killing himself with it. He decides he needs to take it back to his home in Virginia. His brother then finally arrives late and the two decide what to do about their father. A funeral is heald and a multitude of people and lawyers from all over come to share their condolences. Ray decides he needs to sleep at the house to protect the money which he decides to throw into trash bags for easy transport. In the night someone had attempted to break in, he has no clue as to who it may have been but someone else knows of this fortune. Ray finally gets the money back to his apartment in Virginia but he decides it it not safe there. He then brings it to s self storage place to protect it. Over time he purchases 2 more storage units in order to deter anyone from knowing the exact location of the money. There were 3 break ins at his apartment and no suspect was found. After a long time of digging back at his fathers home in Clanton he finds a missing court file. The Judge never had a missing court file. This lead him on a great adventure to the origin of the money and eventually the person who knows of it. The theme of this novel is always to expect the unexpected. Overall I wasn\u2019t quite a fan of this book. It felt very predictable and I always felt like a knew what was coming next. The book had a very good plot that a felt could have been executed in a much better way. The end was a huge shocker but it was only the last 10 pages or so that really made this book worth the read.

We even get to spend lots of time with Harry Rex, infamous divorce lawyer and one of Jake's pals.But this story is about Ray, who is summoned home by his father only to find the judge dead on his sofa and a stash of millions hidden in the walls of the family home.

Problem is, the judge was one step removed from being a pauper. That means the money is dirty, and someone else\u2014someone dangerous\u2014is sniffing around for it.SUMMONS has a few characters who show up and seem important, only to disappear. Critics point to that as a recurring problem in Grisham's novels, but in this case, they're more like red herrings. SUMMONS is a story of paranoia and avarice, sort of like Edgar Alan Poe's \"Telltale Heart\" but with a stash of money in place of a body. We see Ray change as the story goes on, and that puts us in a bind. We want him to get rid of the money for the good of his health and soul, but he also has valid reasons for keeping it, if that's what he should choose to do.Plotting drives most of SUMMONS, but Ray (and Forrest, albeit to a lesser extent) is given time to develop by examining his feelings toward his family and hometown.

However, a summons from his father, Judge Atlee, an almost mythical presence in his hometown of Clanton is about to shatter the tranquillity. Family life is complicated.

I consider \"The Summons\" to be a very good book.Perhaps, those unsatisfied readers were disappointed because this book was not trial based like Grisham's \"A Time to Kill\" or \"The Chamber\". Maybe they were desiring something more like \"The Firm\". This book was different. It deals with family dynamics and a mystery concerning a fortune of unaccountable cash. There is also a good dose of \"living in a small southern town\" mixed in to spice up the story.Some folks did not enjoy the parts of the story devoted to flying aircraft. The main character, a legal professor at University of Virginia, earns $ 160,000 annually and has no family to support. He can afford to fly as a hobby. John Grisham certainly earns enough to fly if he wants to. I wish that I could afford flying lessons myself.Another reason that I enjoyed this book is because part of the story is set in Charlottesville, Virginia. I lived in Charlottesvile for thirty years. Grisham mentions Martha Jefferson Hospital, where I had knee surgery back in the eighties. I worked on the downtown mall for 10 years.

We have Ray, the 'successful' son who is a law professor at the University of Virginia and Forrest, who is the 'black sheep' of the family due to his involvement with drugs. This quote about Ray saying \"I was afraid to give you the money, Forrest\" basically sums up the entire book.

That's certainly why I read The Summons, which was published in 2002 and is Grisham's twelfth novel. One benefit of reading one off books by the same author back to back (at least for the purposes of reviews) is that it does allow you to directly compare quality. Unfortunately in this case it wasn't such an advantage in my quest to enjoy the book that I'm reading, but I'll get to all of that in good time. The general plot of The Summons is very straightforward. The protagonist is Ray Atlee, a college law professor in his early forties. Ray's father is a well known yet aging and very ill Judge who has managed to push his sons away from him through his harsh and unforgiving attitude to life, and his brother is Forrest is a life long drug and alcohol addict on a road to self destruction. For obvious reasons Ray keeps a level of distance between himself and the rest of his immediate family, preferring instead to keep himself to himself and live through his comfortable yet entirely unremarkable life at as slow a pace as possible. However, things are never as straightforward as that in a Grisham novel, and one Spring afternoon Ray receives a summons from Judge Atlee to return home to discuss the details of the family estate. The estate has a low value with very few assets as the Judge gave heavily to charities, but honouring his father's wishes Ray heads back home. However, the meeting never takes place, as on Ray's arrival at the family home he finds that his father has already passed away. But in going through the family home for the purposes of probate, Ray makes a startling discovery of over three million dollars in cash stashed in the Judge's office. This is more money than the Judge could have earned in his lifetime, and certainly more than he could have obtained honourably. What follows are Ray's attempts to trace the source of the money and uncover his father's secrets, but he's doing so against the clock. Someone else knows about the money, and that person will do anything to get it back. Now certainly that plot summary sounds like a Grisham novel, and also sounds like a pretty good premise for a thriller. A little unremarkable perhaps, but promising nonetheless. At least I thought so. Unfortunately The Summons doesn't come close to living up to this glimmer of promise, and personally I consider it to be the worst Grisham novel that I have read by some distance. Why? Well there are a couple of reasons for this damning indictment. The first is that the book is far too slow to gather pace. The moment where the money is discovered is reasonably hard hitting, but rather than running with this the book then settles back into mundane conversations and interactions that have nothing to do with the money. Yes, Ray often thinks about it and considers what to do, but this indecisiveness does nothing to advance the plot, and is just laced in between conversations that, in the grand scheme of things, mean very little. Its not that the conversations are bad in themselves, or that the other characters involved are dull. In fact quite to the contrary. The conversations at times are well laid out and entertaining and the characters, whilst perhaps a little clich\u00e9d for a Grisham novel, are solid enough. It's just that because Ray tells no one of his predicament these characters are entirely detached from the main plotline as regards the money, and as such the conversations are pointless and just serve to draw attention away from the mystery surrounding the money. Even when the realisation hits that someone else is after the money, it just takes so long for anything meaningful to happen. There are set pieces that I assume are intended to build the tension and heighten the anxiety, but unfortunately they do neither because they are wedged between lengthy gaps where Ray converses with other characters or concentrates on the money rather than the mysterious person chasing him. In fact, he seems to shift between being scared of his pursuer and doing things with the money, to the extent where he will bolt at the first sign of trouble, and then immediately calm down and almost assume that no one is chasing him anymore, only to be scared by the next intimidating and mysterious act. This creates a cycle that quickly becomes tiresome. Admittedly the set pieces where he is intimidated are often not bad in their own right, but because the protagonist seems to move on so quickly and concentrate on something else, it just kills any sense of atmosphere that the book could otherwise generate. By the time Ray made any really serious efforts to discover the identity of the person chasing him I had, unfortunately, largely lost interest. And even then the path by which he tries to discover the identity is so detached from the rest of the book that it is not satisfying in the slightest. The clue that leads him on the path comes entirely out of left field, and in the grand scheme of things just doesn't lead anywhere interesting. Especially when you know what Grisham is capable in his other books. There is a twist, which admittedly I only fleetingly expected, but it too was weak and felt tacked on to the end of the plot, doing nothing to salvage that had long since bored me for its lack of focus and coherence. Overall this is a book that I really am struggling to recommend even to the Grisham faithful. I suppose if you are a fan of his novels and have read most of the others, then this is a book that will at least be mildly readable. Certainly there are elements that are enjoyable. It's just that it feels like a by the numbers Grisham novel with no real thought or coherence put into the plot. There are some nice nods and references to his previous novels that fans will pick up on, but these can hardly justify taking the time to read a book that is simply well below the standard that we have come to expect from Grisham. I'm sure those who enjoy his novels will push on regardless and read this through, as indeed I did, but if you don't count yourself in that group I honestly wouldn't bother.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "5352.The_Summons", "book_id": "5352", "book_title": "The Summons", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3205577547", "review_id": "3205577547", "date": "Feb 24, 2020", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Kaleb Ryan", "user_url": "/user/show/95807737-kaleb-ryan", "text": "I hate saying this but I find myself having to be honest constantly as a reviewer, no matter who it is, if it's a favorite of yours, or any other aspect, you have to be brutally honest to a t to maintain integrity.
