It was a war story, and a story of an island, with some lovers in the background.We are welcomed to the story with viewpoints written from several different key players. There is the diary of Carlo, a soldier struggling with a hidden self, Iannis, a doctor who is trying to write a history of the island and his daughter Pelagia, who is 17 and just falling in love for the first time. It is 1940.Through Carlo\u2019s narrative we are dragged through the fighting in Albania by the Greeks and the Italians. It is horrific, full of brutal imagery. I enjoyed the scene when Carlo visits the mother of a comrade - he tells her the death was quick and heroic, whilst his internal monologue reveals the tortured truth.Meanwhile, Iannis and Pelagia are living island life with the uncertainty of the war creeping in. Soon the italian occupiers arrive, along with Captain Corelli - a typical literary hero. He is kind, chivalrous, talented and of course, tall and good looking. Pelagia is a typical heroine - feisty, voluptuous and beautiful. Against a backdrop of some increasing tension, they all cope with one another, and Pelagia and Corelli fall in love. Naturally.But once the Nazi\u2019s arrive, the typical storybook romance ends. What follows is pain, death, poverty, a lost youth and wasted lives. The book is not written with angry language or phrases - it cleverly makes you feel angry. Angry at the waste of everything.Sometimes, I found some passage of description to be longer than it perhaps needed to be. It opens with many different perspectives, leading to some confusion at the beginning, but as they all die we are left with less and less voices to tell the story.I enjoyed the description of Cephalonia and Greek life. The best word for it is colourful. It is romantic, hot, full of liveliness and animals and music. It is well written. My favourite relationship is that of the doctor and Pelagia. It is touching and funny throughout, and there is nothing sickly-sweet about it. He is a hero without being a typical hero and her grief when they are finally separated will make your lips tremble as you have something in your eye.I\u2019m not particularly keen on the ending. I won\u2019t spoil it for you - but if we ever discuss it I shall be particularly vocal about the UNWILLINGNESS TO ASK A GODDAMN QUESTION!", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6580573-captain-corelli-s-mandolin", "book_id": "6580573-captain-corelli-s-mandolin", "book_title": "Captain Corelli's Mandolin (Piano Solo)", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2116621538", "review_id": "2116621538", "date": "Nov 02, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Laura Robinson", "user_url": "/user/show/35490185-laura-robinson", "text": "This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read in my life.

I was very surprised at the story's happy ending; that love found a way through all of the cruelty of everything. However, it was a hard journey to get there and I found myself deeply hurt by many of the loses and deaths of the novel. I also enjoyed how the story took on a unique (at least to me as an American) perspective on WWII. It showed the complexities of the \"good\" guys and the \"bad\" guys and everyone caught in-between. It also showed a path towards forgiveness for some of the failures of the most horrific crimes. My only distraction from the myriad of loveliness and sadness of the story was the shifts in POV. It was really hard for me to keep up and sometimes really irritated me that I could not continue with the POVs I preferred, especially when those stories were exchanged for random side characters.
