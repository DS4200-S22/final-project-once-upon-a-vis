Got some time on your hands? Want to start a long series? But you don't want a dud?Check out this\n booktube video\n all about which series are worth your time (and which ones aren't)! \nHere's the Written Review!\nCan you hear me screaming?As expected, the illustrations brought this book to\u00a0a whole new level.\u00a0I legitimately want to buy another copy, solely to take it apart and\u00a0frame it.Each page is just bursting with new life.\u00a0Honestly, how could you\u00a0not\u00a0love such beautiful images?Hogwarts, Hogwarts. Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit of\u00a0an odd child\u00a0- much to his family's dismay.Things just...\u00a0happened\u00a0...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him and\u00a0a whole new world opens\u00a0in front of his eyes.In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book.\u00a0Just look at these images - they're magnificent:Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!Not only are these\u00a0full-color, high quality images\u00a0but there are so\u00a0many\u00a0of them.Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There's\u00a0pages and pages of pictures\u00a0like this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one. If you haven't read HP recently...I\u00a0strongly urge\u00a0you to check out this book.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads", "num_likes": 1680, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["absolute-favorites", "audiobook"]}, {"book_id_title": "72193.Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher_s_Stone", "book_id": "72193", "book_title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/173429036", "review_id": "173429036", "date": "Jun 03, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lora", "user_url": "/user/show/4632071-lora", "text": "I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love? In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them. (hide spoiler)]FAVORITE QUOTE: \"But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend.

However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It \"ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport.\" There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all. Original review (circa 2010) A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better. Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's That Edward is cooler than Harry, and Bella is smarter than Hermione. Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling. Go ahead, I dare you. Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid. Quite frankly-this book is amazing.

When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks (who here remembers Waldenbooks?) Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre.", "num_likes": 949, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "own", "2021", "read-more-than-once", "series", "young-adult", "2020"]}, {"book_id_title": "72193.Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher_s_Stone", "book_id": "72193", "book_title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/346176116", "review_id": "346176116", "date": "Jun 10, 2012", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "user_url": "/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "text": "Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn't get along with people very well.

If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize. I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range. If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time. And I've read it twice to my daughter, Celyn. We read the first 5 some years back, and now she's 12 we're going to read the whole lot. She's very disabled and can't read for herself (she can't hold the book or see the page for starters...) Having just finished I've checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2. So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review... I liked the book. I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children's book or why so many adults are so taken with it. JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily. She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test ... or the key hadn't been left in the same room as the door that wouldn't yield to magic ... would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure? Yes ... it was more fun this way, but ... dammit ... kids aren't stupid...But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one... it's all good. Celyn certainly enjoyed it. She's on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that 'muggles' are somehow lesser. That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we're invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so). But all the time I read this I'm feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing. I will report back on book 2 when we're done.EDITED IN FROM THE COMMENTS:>>Aliyah wrote: \"Personally I believe the trope is so familiar to you because of JK Rowling. She made this style of fantasy more popular.\">My reply: Personal beliefs are fine and dandy, but in this instance ... badly wrong.My first encounter with magic schools was in The Worst Witch series (1974) which centres on a magic school and which I began in 1974. Followed by A Wizard of Earthsea (1968) which also centres on a magic school and which I read in 1975.The mechanics of reaching a boarding school on a dedicated train laid on for the purpose and of sorting a boarding school into four groups to be housed in four towers was something I encountered at a still younger age in the early 70s in my mother's copy of First Term at Malory Towers (1946).

There's a reason us, the Fans, feel that we're connected, no matter where we from, different culture, ethics, ages..we're all graduated from there....Hogwarts.. even like we were in same class,classmates, no matter which edition we read....Cause Harry Potter is not just a story..it's a Life..The Boy Who Saved Flourished the Book IndustryIt's One of the most important novels in modern history, Sorry, it's The Most Important ONE.This Review also for those who hate the series !Please bear with me..Without it, most Book stores & publishers may have the same fate of Video Stores like Blockbuster LLC, which, despite being super popular in the 90s, closed all the stores by 2013, shutting down forever.Yes, without this Novel, and with the rapid change in technology, the ease of making e-books and reading it in PCs, Smartphones, Tablets..etc, the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly.It'd be limited for religious or educating books, classics, small novels. Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel, The One.Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,\nA Brief !! History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------\nWell, let\u2019s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens, not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo\u2026 Those of this new generation who read are \u201cweirdos\" or \"nerds\u201d to the rest of their peers.And for those \u201cfew who read\u201d, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie -what\u2019s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?- , also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, in Egypt no more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites -this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine\u2019s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there\u2019s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made \u201cPocket Novels\u201d for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There\u2019s also \u201cReading for All\u201d, project by the first lady \u201cSusan Mubarak\u201d, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn't attract \u201cmore and more\u201d of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don\u2019t just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractive Reading Experience to get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in 1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it\u2019s Playstation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman\u2019s comics when you can play them..\n~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~\nSo by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it\u2019s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it\u2019s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, when Joanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel, that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it, and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it\u2019s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest \u201cBloomsbury\u201c agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she\u2019d get a day job, since it\u2019s a little chance of making money in children's books. - later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother\u2019s \"Kathleen\" come the 2 initial of her pen name..\nJ . k . Rowling\nAnd in 26 June 1997 , with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\nAnd Bam!! , everything happened so fast..Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, 'Philosopher's Stone' to be 'Sorcerer's Stone', as the American publisher feared 'Philosopher's' may not be that attractive to young readers..And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher's Stone's legend.In 1998 Book Two released in UK , 1999 in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.\n\nAnd on 8 July 1999, The \nFirst Breaking Record\n made when Book Three sold 68.000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it's even still in hardcover editions.This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the 'Harry Potter books' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into 'Children Books' and 'Adult Books' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of 8 July 2000 in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple stores as happening theses days, But it was in front of Bookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of... Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn't mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language. And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then, but that's not our subject now. \n~~~~~~ ~~~~~~\nWith the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings -which was a super successful movie by then too- Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.Even in Egypt English edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.\n~~~~~~ ~~~~~~\nThe good news is, the literary movement didn't stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there's more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..By 2002 ,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.And in April 2003 Dan Brown (previously published 3 novels, making good sales) released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records, The Da Vinci Code..The funny thing that there's a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is 'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.A month later, May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel, The Kate Runner  which also made a very good records too. -Don't you agree if there's no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance? He'd be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)- And all that didn't affect the main reason for this new 'Literal Renaissance'.All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..On 20 June 2003 book Five 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' comes out..Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they've been waiting for at least 2 years. Shipping agents like FedEx made the delivery to many countries to get the book at the same time.A New world Record ,5 millions copy at the first day only..For the first time in France a non french language book placed in no.1 of the bestselling book....Some kids got a headache called 'Harry Potter Headache' as they read the whole 850 pages of the book five, the biggest so far, at the same day without resting.And in Egypt, September the same year, the Arabic edition of book three comes out with unexpected sales records, first edition run out of the stores by the first week only, though it's nearly the beginning of the School year, and the movie of this 3rd book still filming. \u0650And the price of it get higher 20% in 2 days and still with increasing demand..More English books and novels sold in Egypt too, along with the Arabic ones, publishing more books for new Egyptian authors and writers along with more of the famous ones, Alaa El Aswany's debut Novel 'Yaqubean's Building' making a very good selling numbers..\n\nAnd in  July 2004 the Arabic edition of Book Four makes a price war between book stores and magazines stands.January 2005 , an abridged translated edition of Book Five make many readers angry in Egypt , specially that many already read the English edition before, so the publisher release an unabridged one by May.\n~~~~~~ ~~~~~~\nAnd on 21 July 2005, A Higher Record that breaks all the previously ones\n\n 6.9 million copy of Book Six sold in US in its first day only...A huge book, it may not be as the fans' expectations of being full of action , but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters, Professor Snape. That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months..With Pre-Final Book of Harry Potter is out, it followed by a massive variety of New Novels, New Series, New Authors..Twilight series, Percy Jackson series, and much more, more Books Sales not only in US, UK but worldwide..More Novels hit the top sales..A Real Prosperity.But still Harry Potter is the Records Big Breaker...At the midnight before 21 June 2007, Everywhere around the Globe, the scene of thousands of people lining in front of Book Stores was repeated...even Bigger than any time before..A Huge Record for Pre-Orders online reach to One Million copies by Amazon only, and total sales of 11 millions copies in UK and US in the first day only.The book sold at the Same Day almost in Every Single Country..even in Israel which made a big religious fuss because the Book Stores opened to receive and sell the book at the releasing day which was their holy Saturday, But it's Harry Potter after all, the world's most unusual, unexpected phenomenon and sales records breaker.And that's not bad, it was the Miracle of bringing back readers to Book Stores...And it's not just Harry Potter...Now, that \n'All was well.'\n , thousands of topics went online asking 'what to read next'....Indeed, although there's the e-books, e-readers..etc, still there's thousands of new books and novels published and sold every year , in every where in the world.The gaming devices is increasing? yes, But not as expected though by the 90s and early 2000s 'remember Nokia N-Gage?'.. but so does the reading devices which first come out by Sony in 2004,make big step by Amazon's Kindle in 2007...the ebook applications on every device.New books and series come after that, and still on, making super sales, attracting more readers... more writers come with more books and novels, some are just a rip off others and some are really original and brilliant. in UK, US , Egypt ..everywhere all over the globe..No matter a Playstation 4 is out, or new Xbox, the Books still there...with its most beloved magic.. The magic of books is back and , I believe, to stay..Don't you see with me that the magic of Harry Potter is one of the main factors of this magic?\n\u201cThis boy will be famous. There won\u2019t be a child in our world who doesn\u2019t know his name\u201d\nThat's what Rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book.. The one that rejected by 12 Publishing Houses in 1996..Well, what about now?God, Talked too much in the \"Brief\" introduction , didn't I?Well, that's it for this review... I guess some still think it's just the Propaganda that made that all....Well I'll try to prove them wrong by the upcoming next 6 reviews at the other 6 Books of the series..Links will be here as soon as it'd done ..But for The First one... sorry to add one more , but 20000 characters aren't enough.The Ultimate Review of Book OneNow I'll be back to go around Hogwarts...

So here it is again, may it stick around this time! \u201dIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.\u201dOkay, here\u2019s the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it\u2019s safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol* So I decided to make this a short \u201cmy thoughts about this book\u201d review. ;-P1.)\t\u201dThirty-six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him. 2.)\t\u201dAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry \u2013 yer a wizard.\u201dBless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD3.)\t\u201dBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d \u201cGreat idea though, thanks, Mum.\u201dHaha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)4.)\t\u201dAre you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u201d said the girl. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not very good, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\u2019s all worked for me.\u201dWhen I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I\u2019m really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol* 5.)\t\u201dYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201dUrgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I\u2019ll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he\u2019s still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs* 6.)\t\u201dLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\u201dAnd here comes another character I\u2019ll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he\u2019s unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn\u2019t excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry\u2019s father. Well done! ;-)7.)\t\u201dBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\u201dI still love that scene and I\u2019m really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don\u2019t want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don\u2019t get caught anymore. Haha! 8.)\t\u201dAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\u201dLee Jordan is the best! <3 He\u2019s the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant! 9.)\t\u201dIf I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there. It\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would have done, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side!\u201dI LOVE HARRY\u2019S DEFIANCE!!! That\u2019s one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he\u2019s facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he\u2019s going to be a great MC!

When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldn\u2019t have been happier. As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I\u2019d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.Harry deserves it. However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I\u2019ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people. Here goes...Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that. It\u2019s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn\u2019t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success. Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry\u2019s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity\u2019s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.How is that not worthy of praise?As for Harry himself, he\u2019s just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He\u2019s someone you can\u2019t help but like. He\u2019s not perfect. He makes mistakes, he\u2019s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas. But that\u2019s not Harry. He\u2019s a better person than that. That\u2019s why we love him. Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let\u2019s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy. I\u2019ll certainly settle for that. As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I\u2019m not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don\u2019t think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.3.0 stars. Highly Recommended.

There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.\u275e\nEveryone grew up with Harry Potter. They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.Except me. I didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn't get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it's like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It's just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn't be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn't bother and wouldn't care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.\nThere is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.\nHarry Potter is one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there. It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it. No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person's heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world. As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children's book but in my opinion, it's in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some. Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names. Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn't even know he was a wizard. Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful \"family\", The Dursleys. Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter's mother's sister. The problem is, they didn't like each other, nor blend in with each other. They were different. Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren't able to turn things into other things, aren't able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren't able to do anything, really. The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn't able to. His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn't bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person. Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies. Except they don't.As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn't know. He doesn't know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent. After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it. He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn't want Harry to know. But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.He's huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well. He's got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents. One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well. And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too. He doesn't know what he is talking about and doesn't know what is going on. He doesn't believe he is a wizard, and doesn't believe the reason for his parent's deaths. But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school. As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else. Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand. He's famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened. But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out. As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it's time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends. Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him. He's not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend. Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be. Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like \"we get it.\" Days pass, and Harry is being trained. He's a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone. Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out. With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this \"You-Know-Who\" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever.\nHumans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\nHarry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars. Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, \"Why did I not read this earlier?\" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it's because I was never a fan of it. I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it. I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it. But soon I'll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen. Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young. PATHETIC.The fantasy is cute, I will say. It's easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through. It's not long, it's not hard, and it's not boring. It's gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page. Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses. Well, I guess in most.Everything was fun to read. I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life. He was confused, but he found out a lot more. There's still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how. I'll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness'. I'll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes. I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think. I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger. I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy. But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I'm on an adventure. Reading it for the first time feels like one. I've never watched the films. I've watched parts, but skipped them. Now, I won't skip anything. It's like an adventure where I'm dived in and can't seem to leave because I'm so alive and intrigued.What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said? Nothing. Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too. Everyone loves it, and so did I. Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed. But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene. Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired. Or both. But I was also laughing. I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid. Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious. I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig. I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that's okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times. Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him. He's so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry. I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry. He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end. Ron is honestly the cutest. I don't understand how anyone could be mean to him. He may be weak, but he has his own strengths. He's so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him. There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I'll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he's still gonna be really mean throughout the series. I'm sure. I haven't spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else's life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way. Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy. She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor. She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites. I know it didn't work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle. Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them. She didn't yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again. As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn't really figure out what to say. But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning. It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes. The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand. There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems. I didn't know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences. I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail. Like always, it's no surprise. \nThere are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\nOverall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest.

Yes.Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won't end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.Imaginative VisionI read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, \"The Wizard of Oz,\" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.The ultimate model for Harry Potter is \"Tom Brown's School Days\" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken \"Tom Brown's School Days\" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of \"Harry Potter.\" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's \"The Wind in the Willows\" or the \"Alice\" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the \"perfectly normal\" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations.

As of this writing, I have 98 Goodreads friends. 61 (62%) of them have read J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Out of those who read this, 39 (64%) rated this with 5 stars. 11 of them with 4 stars. All the others gave 3 or 2. Only 2 rated this with 1 star. One of them admitted not being able to finish it. She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety. (But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside. I read only those books that my brother told me to read. He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype. However, when Warner Bros. released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date. I was wrong. She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed. We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it: \nI will never read Harry Potter\n.My daughter is now 15 going 16. She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter. However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books. Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read. So the following day, I bought my copy.After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it? Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars? Most of them did not bother writing a review. Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet. But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long.These are what some of them say: it was a great book i enjoyed reading it For an eloquent reviewer, she must have been too happy to express herself.  Such a great story and creative way of writing. I love Harry Potter.  Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative.  I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too! It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter. Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book. I enjoyed reading it Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads. I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though.  Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards. Another one of my favorite reviewers. That seems to have nailed this. Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery. That should be it! The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work. The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school. Blasphemy.Just kidding. This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it. I was just kidding. To be frank, I tried hard not to like this. I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book. I told you so! Why waste your time? . However, unless you are a grumpy old man/woman, there is nothing not to like about this book. I maybe too old for it but hey, talent is talent and J. K.

I was 9, summer 2001 & it was my (very) belated birthday gift (& I'm grateful for that); long ago, before there was a hype, 1st movie was about to come out. so I just read this one book I had again & again & again... (I guess I bought 2nd soon after, & re-read them together :D)I remember my feelings at the first read; like I was thrilled because I thought that 'H' on the seal was because of Harry's initial.Take me back to my childhood, when everything seemed simpler...I've grown up with this series & loved every minutes of it.this book & this series never gets old. still as excellent as my first read, even though I know all the details & even many of the sentences.fun great beginningCute story, magical, brilliant, unique with many lovable characters in a magnificent castle & wonderful world. \n\"Hogwarts will always be there to Welcome you Home\"\nevery chapters; amazing. interesting. intriguing!Wonderful!Epic!Wow!!!Quidditch!Friendship!\"There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\u201dI love this quote!I enjoy these stories happening in this world, the real world.also the ones you can be sorted in the story & feel you are really there.cute courageous & (yeah I'm gonna say it, because he is in the great matters of life) wise Harryloyal daring Ron& smart book lover Hermionehilarious twins!Lee Jordan's commentating!Professor McGonagall!Wood!oh Hagrid!

I actually knew most of the sentences & of course I know what would happen next, but it is still as interesting & cute as the first time, even if the element of surprise is long gone for me; but I can completely remember which parts I stare at the book with an open mouth. :DEvery time I missed them & start to re-read them, nostalgic & delighted, I am that 9 yo little girl who loved this world, which crafted my childhood & teenage years, majority of my life & memory, teaching me many things.14th re-read: June 2018 was my first time that I tried HP in English (after so many times reading; 11 times for book 1 & 2 to 5-6 times for book 6 & 7) & I can say it was even more AMAZING. <3Audiobook is like reading in the dark, isn't it?; you don't need light to stay up all night reading.
