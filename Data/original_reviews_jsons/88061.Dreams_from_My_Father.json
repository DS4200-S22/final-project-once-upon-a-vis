It is, I think, a great way to \u201cget to know\u201d the candidate outside of the media, the hype, and the confusion that comes along with a presidential bid.The book follows Barack through his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, his community work in Chicago, and his journey to meet his father\u2019s family in Kenya. Along the way, he has to come to terms with the death of his absent father, being raised primarily by his white grandparents (you don\u2019t hear about this much), and learning the ropes of being a community organizer in inner city Chicago.The thing that amazed me most about the book was watching Obama 1) work through problems and 2) analyze both sides on an issue. These two traits came through in two different ways in the book: in personal situations (how he comes to understand and accept his troubled father and his Kenyan ancestry) and in political situations (how he comes to understand the long-standing and deep problems facing the urban poor).It would have been very, very easy to have bad guys in this book. Evil high-up government officials who prevent community centers and jobs from reaching the impoverished in Chicago. His adulterous and alcoholic father who seemed to abandon his loved ones at every turn. But Barack thinks his way through these simple binary good/bad categories and goes far beyond them. He is constantly striving to 1) understand situations from all points of view and 2) think his way through to a solution. He has an uncanny ability to step away from the emotions of a problem and then systematically chip away at it. He understands very well that you have to know why things are as they are before you develop a plan about how to fix it.The best example of this might be his work in Chicago. Although it\u2019s unheard of for anyone to criticize the black ministers who organize the urban black communities in Chicago, Obama quickly began to understand the huge problems that come with church-based activism in black communities. Churches would rarely work together to solve larger problems and ministers would rarely do more than preach (which, to be fair, is their job). The action that should have followed a sermon simply wasn\u2019t organized. Because many black leaders were ministers, many black leaders were also, essentially, just talk. What followed was three years of work in which Obama not only made major, innovative steps in Chicago but in which he also learned how to inspire both individuals and small groups into action.I was also impressed by what Barack Obama didn\u2019t leave out of the book. He made a lot of mistakes, he deals with a lot of anger, and he doesn\u2019t succeed at everything. Still, you can not only see him learning from his mistakes, but immediately applying those lessons to his next challenge.The book, as a more general read, was good as well. The writing wasn\u2019t stellar (something Obama is quick to point out in the forward to the reprint) but it was still much better than one might expect from someone who isn\u2019t primarily a writer. Getting to see the inner struggle of a biracial person growing up in 60s and 70s America was also really fascinating.There are a lot of great candidates in the upcoming election, and I feel positive about more than two of them. But especially after reading this book, my doubts about Obama\u2019s lack of experience are gone. He has something that trumps years in Washington: a stellar judgment and an almost eerie ability to put himself in someone else\u2019s shoes and understand both sides of an issue. More than that, his ability to inspire individuals to action is something that America could truly benefit from. You can even see it in his campaign: ordinary people stepping up and acting, even if they\u2019ve never been involved in politics before.I know that after reading his book, I donated to a political campaign for the first time in my life. He\u2019s nothing less than inspiring.", "num_likes": 292, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2131220285", "review_id": "2131220285", "date": "Sep 21, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Elyse  Walters", "user_url": "/user/show/597461-elyse-walters", "text": "Audiobook.....read by Barack Obama An oldie but goodie:It was wonderful listening to Obama. He\u2019s so cordial......and..... ....ordinary and extraordinary!I especially loved when Obama talked about his mother. I laughed when \u2018mom\u2019 forced Obama to eat his breakfast each day before school \u2014 with Obama rolling his eyes as if it was torture ( I could relate - I did everything I could to get out of eating breakfast as a kid)....... but where my mother just gave up and went back to bed \u2014 Obama\u2019s mother gave him the evil eye and made him eat and said.....\u201dlisten buster, it\u2019s no picnic for me either\u201d. At the very beginning of this audiobook- which has been updated since the book was first written....Obama says if he were to have written this book today he \u2018may\u2019have written the entire thing about his mother. There is not a day that goes by that he does not miss her.Obama\u2019s mother is a woman I would have liked to have met. She was an exceptional woman - and it\u2019s no accident that she raised a brilliant son. She took her job as parenting as serious as any parent had...........she was always teaching.....about integrity- morals - honesty - fairness - straight talk - independent thought - safety- healthy habits - and the value of a great education.It was common for Obama\u2019s mother to stop whatever they were doing and say things like this: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to grow into a decent human being you\u2019re going to need some values\u201d. She believed thoughtful people could shape their own destiny\u2014 she was not a religious person \u2014but had good common sense.It was through Obama\u2019s mother where he learned about his absent fathers values...No matter how poor his father was, (his mother tells Obama), he was a man of integrity. Obama was raised to inherit the best characteristics of his father. Hallelujah!!!!! Obama said he had no choice but to be a decent moral man - it was in his genes.Ohhhhh how I miss Obama being our President!

The last 1/3 of the book and his homecoming to Kenya was great because I got to see a more intimate glance of his fractured immigrant family and his reflections for how his lineage influenced the person he is today. Unfortunately, I found most of the book (especially the beginning) to be dry and lacking emotional connection. I felt like it was written mostly in a prescriptive manner akin to just reading a Wikipedia article about his family and childhood. Even some of the personal anecdotes he added felt disconnected. This is kind of a shame since his cultural makeup is so diverse and interesting but it got watered down into a straightforward history lesson. I think we could have dived deeper into his identity and what it's like to be a mixed man in his community, and I wish his writing had properly conveyed his personality and psyche better.", "num_likes": 190, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/29188236", "review_id": "29188236", "date": "Aug 04, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Michelle", "user_url": "/user/show/1361712-michelle", "text": "With Barack Obama running for president, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at who this candidate was. I had been warned by another friend (not a Obama supporter, I should note) that it was poorly written and its message unclear. This perplexed me a bit since that had been contrary to what it seemed like everyone had been saying.Well, I, on the other hand, found it a completely absorbing read. It's well-written and an interesting story. I wish everyone could read it; there are so many misunderstandings about Barack's life. While I'm sure there are parts that have been changed, dramatized, shifted around, the theme behind the events that Barack chronicles is evident. It's the story of a boy trying to comprehend who he is, to reconcile with the fact that he looks undeniably different than his mother and grandparents, to cope with the mysterious, absent figure that is his father.The book provides a better understanding of not only Barack Obama's life, but a greater understanding of who Barack Obama is and why he is the way he is. This book, of course, only presents one side of who Barack Obama is - and the side that Obama presents himself. So, as with all autobiographies, I took it with a grain of salt. But after reading it, I had a much greater respect for him... he worked for years as a community organizer, and it wasn't until I read his book that I realized how hard that work was.Barack Obama has led a life no one else could really understand, but everyone can relate to in some capacity. I know one of the arguments against him as president is that he doesn't have a lot of experience in office, but after reading this book, one might argue that he has plenty of experience in far more important areas that would serve him better if he were elected.", "num_likes": 126, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["nonfiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/418440833", "review_id": "418440833", "date": "Dec 20, 2019", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "user_url": "/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "text": "Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, Barack ObamaDreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance (1995) is a memoir by Barack Obama, who was elected as U.S. President in 2008. The memoir explores the events of Obama's early years in Honolulu and Chicago up until his entry into law school in 1988. Obama published the memoir in July 1995, when he was starting his political campaign for Illinois Senate. He had been elected as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review in 1990.Obama recounts his life up to his enrollment in Harvard Law School. He was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Barack Obama Sr. of Kenya, and Ann Dunham of Wichita, Kansas, who had met as students at the University of Hawaii. Obama's parents separated in 1963 and divorced in 1964, when he was two years old. Obama's father went to Harvard to pursue his PhD in economics. After that, he returned to Kenya to fulfill the promise to his nation.Obama formed an image of his absent father from stories told by his mother and her parents. He saw his father one more time, in 1971, when Obama Sr. came to Hawaii for a month's visit. The elder Obama, who had remarried, died in a car accident in Kenya in 1982.After her divorce, Ann Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, a Javanese surveyor from Indonesia who was a graduate student in Hawaii. The family moved to Jakarta. When Obama was ten, he returned to Hawaii under the care of his maternal grandparents (and later his mother) for the better educational opportunities available there. He was enrolled in the fifth grade at Punahou School, a private college-preparatory school, where he was one of six black students. Obama attended Punahou School from the 5th grade until his graduation from the 12th grade, in 1979. Obama writes: \"For my grandparents, my admission into Punahou Academy heralded the start of something grand, an elevation in the family status that they took great pains to let everyone know.\" There, he met Ray (Keith Kakugawa), who was two years older and also multi-racial. He introduced Obama to the African-American community.Upon finishing high school, Obama moved to Los Angeles for studies at Occidental College. He describes having lived a \"party\" lifestyle of drug and alcohol use. After two years at Occidental, he transferred to Columbia College at Columbia University, in New York City, where he majored in Political Science.Upon graduation, Obama worked for a year in business. He moved to Chicago, where he worked for a non-profit as a community organizer in the Altgeld Gardens housing project on the city's mostly black South Side. Obama recounts the difficulty of the experience, as his program faced resistance from entrenched community leaders and apathy on the part of the established bureaucracy. During this period, Obama first visited Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ, which became the center of his spiritual life. Before attending Harvard Law School, Obama decided to visit relatives in Kenya. He recounts part of this experience in the final, emotional third of the book. Obama used his memoir to reflect on his personal experiences with race and race relations in the United States.\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647

"/user/show/59357213-sam", "text": "In early 2017, for many people in the U.S. and abroad, Obama nostalgia is real and rampant. I used the moment to look back at Barack Obama before he was president, before he was a US Senator and a state senator for Illinois, and discover the making of the man in his memoir Dreams from My Father. Overall, I'd give this 3.5 stars and round up to 4 stars. I very much enjoyed parts of Obama's journey to adulthood, especially his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia which I found interesting and well-written, and while the later chapters detailing the consuming, difficult work of community organizing in Chicago and then meeting his extended family in Kenya prior to beginning law school also offer great insight, they are a bit less structurally sound, more peppered with rhetoric, less narrative oriented than the previous chapters. But it's a fascinating glimpse at the early life of the 44th president in his own words, and I enjoyed seeing the anecdotal threads that connected to Obama's personality and policies during his presidency. And his meditations on race relations and his own personal struggle with identity were enlightening, and I personally found it intriguing and answered some questions I'd had about Obama's self-categorization as being black, and not biracial.Above all though, you get a firsthand glimpse of the young \"Barry\" Obama becoming Barack, and what it meant to be a biracial and a black man coming of age in the 60s, 70s and early 80s. His writing and he are intelligent and compassionate, but sometimes the writing style can turn a bit self-indulgent or smug, a criticism lobbed during Obama's presidency but much more subdued than in Dreams with My Father, showing the progress and maturity of a man more comfortable in his own intelligence and skin. He writes of his rage and his anger, but also his vulnerability and fear, of and for himself, and of and for the world he inhabits, and sometimes neither party knows quite what to do with each other. I both understood and was puzzled by some of his feelings of loathing and anger towards himself and US society: I too am a biracial American with a black father and a white mother, though female and with two American parents born and raised, and I personally could connect with various aspects of his struggle and the larger struggle of the black community. But I've never had to face a choice or confusion over what race to be or how to identify myself: I was raised to think of myself as both black and white, as biracial. When Obama was first elected and I discovered he identified himself as black, I accepted that as his right, but was mildly disappointed he hadn't seized a moment to show other multiracial children and adults that the world doesn't (or shouldn't) require them to pick a side, so to speak, that we can represent and be part of both/all races equally. But reading his memoir, and seeing just how different it can be to be a biracial child of the 60s to late 70s, versus me, born in the late 80s coming of age in the 90s and 00s, I definitely got a much better, fuller, deeper understanding of how, where and why Obama came to his own self-identification that still allowed for the embrace of his diverse background. I hadn't heard of Obama or Dreams from My Father when it was first published in 1995 (like most Americans, plus I was nine), and while I was well aware of the book in 2004 when it was re-released just after his famous DNC keynote address, I just never ended up reading it. Reading it now, over two decades after it was first published, I've gained a much better appreciation both for Barack Obama, President, but even more so Barack Obama, person, and even if the version we meet in Dreams with My Father is simply a snapshot in time, the major elements of all the best attributes and actions of Obama are visible. And even if I had some occasional issues with the writing, tone, pacing, I overall found this a worthy read, informative and entertaining and thought provoking. It was a privilege to read through Obama's very personal struggles and difficulties and feel his compassion for others, knowing what path that man would take, and it's a fantastic story: from being estranged from the world, he would go on to lead it.", "num_likes": 88, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2017-reads", "aty-challenge-2017"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/24406423", "review_id": "24406423", "date": "Jun 13, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lorenzo Pilla", "user_url": "/user/show/110473-lorenzo-pilla", "text": "Forget for a moment who the author has become.

For that reason, it's a very honest account of an American coming to terms with who he is and where he's from. As a bonus, Obama happens to be an excellent writer. He has a good sense of how to fashion an interesting narrative, so his personal story is very engaging.As a normal part of becoming an adult, a boy at some point begins to look critically at, and compare himself to, his father. And if that father was physically or emotionally absent, it may be even more true and a more important rite of passage. Obama's account of his own search for his missing father is compelling and it is one that many men can relate to. And for that reason it is also a book that should be read by women who want to understand men.Beyond issues of men and their fathers, Obama also relates his struggle for identity as a black man in a white family in the 1970s, as a boy being raised by his single mother and grandparents, as a teenager making decisions about drugs, and a host of other issues.In short, this is a great 'book-club book' because there are so many broad themes that can be catalysts for discussion.Whether or not you're a fan of this president's politics, challenge yourself to look beyond that and discover the richness in this important memoir.", "num_likes": 72, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["non-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1287611750", "review_id": "1287611750", "date": "May 23, 2015", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Diane Wallace", "user_url": "/user/show/43342511-diane-wallace", "text": "Great read! about understanding and finding out his past upbringing,life and history etc (paperback!)", "num_likes": 61, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3636773322", "review_id": "3636773322", "date": "Nov 09, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Amalia Gkavea", "user_url": "/user/show/56789747-amalia-gkavea", "text": "\n\u201cI thought I could start over, you see.

The ghosts of his father and his journey towards finding and understanding him was also compelling as it applies to the man that Obama became.

Mission accomplished!! I saw all the things that I loved about Obama present and it just reminded me about the man that I admire. No, I don't think Obama is perfect, but his innate good qualities shine through. As a person who reads, it's wonderful that man that I so admire is a writer. No ghostwriter needed.

Apart from any of the political ideas in the book or whether or not one is excited by his presidency, Obama is a fantastic writer -- this is one of the best memoirs I have ever read. Apart from an occasional slip into melodramatic prose (very occasional, and certainly less than the average memoir), the prose balanced clarity and description, and Obama very consciously keeps from slipping into nostalgia or over-idealizing any time in his life or place he visits. After his terms in office (note the optimistic plural!), he could easily have a career as an author. Had he never become president, or even entered politics, this would be a book worth reading, and one of the best modern coming-of-age stories out there. Slipping from review into personal politics, reading this book was exhilarating. Like much of his base, I've been a fan of Obama's ever since the '04 Convention. I was actually voting for Richardson (yes, I was part of that 2% of the electorate) up until Obama gave his speech on race last March, when I decided not only would he make a good president, but that America NEEDED Obama. Still, I never read any of his writing -- didn't want to be too rabid, and even know I know that, over the next eight years he will disappoint me, make compromises, and have to be part of the political machine. I was excited enough to travel do get out the vote on election day and to brave D.C. for the inauguration, and yet reading this book made me even MORE excited that this man is our president. Because he gets it: us, America, blacks, whites, working-class people, intellectuals, immigrants. The fact that a man who has had the thoughts he puts in this book, who has struggled with coming of age as a young black man, who has loved his white mother, organized in the projects of Chicago, struggled in school, and travelled to Africa is running our country is amazing. His insights on race, history, identity, and class are some of the most nuanced and astute I've read -- he understands how his white grandfather could be both a well-intentioned progressive and yet involuntarily racist at the same time; how young black men can be both victims of and perpetuators of the myths of masculinity and race that ensnare them; how most people are actually good but that being good isn't necessarily enough to escape the weight of history and mutual misunderstanding.Whether you have a huge crush on Obama (like myself!), are more restrained, or even didn't vote for him, you owe it to yourself to read this book, to better understand where the man who is now our President is coming from.", "num_likes": 37, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["political"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/24553444", "review_id": "24553444", "date": "Jun 15, 2008", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Siria", "user_url": "/user/show/115473-siria", "text": "In the introduction, Obama writes that looking back on this book after the passage of over a decade, he winces at inelegant phrasing, and wishes that he could excise perhaps fifty of its four hundred and fifty pages. That's the kind of self-critique with which this book abounds\u2014honest and very deliberately even-handed. It's a critique I agree with, by the way\u2014Obama has a tendency to go off on slight rhetorical flights which may sound good when delivered in a speech, but which need to be tempered somewhat when confined to the page\u2014but those quibbles aside, I thought this was an astoundingly well-written memoir, especially given the fact that it was written by someone then only in his thirties. So few politicians have the ability to write with such vivid clarity and such honesty.I found his discussion of the intersections of race, politics, and culture in modern America to be very interesting, particularly since I am from a country which doesn't have a history of absorbing many people of other racial backgrounds, but which is beginning to be forced to face its own latent racism thanks to a growing tide of modern immigration. It was compelling and thought-provoking; many times I caught myself thinking \"But...\" and then wondering why I had that reaction, why my own defensiveness, and unpacking some of that while I read took time. The opening half of the book, in which Obama describes his childhood and his experiences in college and working in Chicago, interested me the most; perhaps, I think, because he was very good at showing the ways in which he was situated within wider (white) American culture, and the difficulties and the confusions and the hurts that this had caused him and the black community. I thought the latter half, set in Africa, wobbled a little because it displayed a self-indulgence that Obama had not previously been prone to, and because for all that Obama examined his relationship to Africa in terms of his own blackness, he seemed curiously unwilling to do so in terms of his own Americanness.There's one strange thing I noticed: Obama, in what I've seen of him in interviews and on television, has always seemed to be very charming and very personable, with a ready wit. Very little of that came across in this book; he didn't seem to laugh at himself very much\u2014intelligent and personable, yes, but some of the spark of charisma was missing.

He was thirty-three at the time of its publication, a graduate of Harvard Law and practicing in Chicago. Thoughts of a run for the Senate were beginning to coalesce. He was, at this stage, an exacting man. So when he tells us this is a story of race and inheritance, we may be certain it is precisely that.His is a strong and sometimes stiff accounting of life as the son of an African father and a white American mother - that straddle of our nation's racial divide. It is the story of a man's cultural consciousness coming of age. And it is a form of testimony honed, through both its strength and stiffness, to passages possessed of a remarkably sharp and powerful edge.The following (admittedly long) passage is pulled as a sample of the quality of thought and self-reflection Barack Obama applies to the matters that concern him. It is the middle of the night. There are boys in a car on the street out front, their noise disrupting the sleep of the neighborhood. He has come down to ask them to move on.The four boys inside say nothing, don't even move. The wind wipes away my drowsiness, and I feel suddenly exposed, standing in a pair of shorts on the sidewalk in the middle of the night. I can't see their faces inside the car; it's too dark to know how old they are, whether they're sober or drunk, good boys or bad. One of them could be Kyle. One of them could be Roy. One of them could be Johnnie.One of them could be me. Standing there, I try to remember the days when I would have been sitting in a car like that, full of inarticulate resentments and desperate to prove my place in the world. The feelings of righteous anger as I shout at Gramps for some forgotten reason. The blood rush of a high school brawl. The swagger that carries me into a classroom drunk or high, knowing that my teachers will smell beer or reefer on my breath, just daring them to say something. I start picturing myself through the eyes of these boys, a figure of random authority, and know the calculations they might now be making, that if one of them can't take me out, the four of them certainly can.That knotted, howling assertion of self - as I try to pierce the darkness and read the shadowed faces inside the car, I'm thinking that while these boys may be weaker or stronger than I was at their age, the only difference that matters is this: The world in which I spent those difficult times was far more forgiving. These boys have no margin for error; if they carry guns, those guns will offer them no protection from that truth. And it is that truth, a truth that they surely sense but can't admit and, in fact, must refuse if they are to wake up tomorrow, that has forced them, or others like them, eventually to shut off access to any empathy they may once have felt. Their unruly maleness will not be contained, as mine finally was, by a sense of sadness at an older man's injured pride. Their anger won't be checked by the intimation of danger that would come upon me whenever I split another boy's lip or raced down a highway with gin clouding my head. As I stand there, I find myself thinking that somewhere down the line both guilt and empathy speak to our own buried sense that an order of some sort is required, not the social order that exists, necessarily, but something more fundamental and more demanding; a sense, further, that one has a stake in this order, a wish that, no matter how fluid this order sometimes appears, it will not drain out of the universe...And this, for me, is important. Because a wall is a symbol. A symbol. And I ask myself if I want to spend all my energy constructing a physical representation of my fear, or instead get to work on its cause. Isn't what I'm really after the development of a more rigorous and principled standard of order? Harder to build than a wall...but then, most things are.This is a book I recommend not only to those curious about the life of our former president, but to anyone seeking an entry point to a more comprehensive contemplation of race in modern-day America.", "num_likes": 29, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["memoir-biography"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5225366", "review_id": "5225366", "date": "Aug 28, 2007", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Tasha", "user_url": "/user/show/114750-tasha", "text": "Book was boring.

That said, some of the lengthy telling of his father's life, in the words of Kenyan relatives were much flatter.My only gripes are the lack of an index or a family tree of his complicated Kenyan family (and a few photos might have been nice).Overall, a very enjoyable and positive experience.

Origins left me thinking about community: its value, how we choose it, are chosen by it, and what it means to be within and without community. Origins also made me ponder how challenging adolescence is for anyone and how those challenges are compounded for someone who doesn't quite fit in to any one category.Chicago made me think about what I see as the big problems of our society today: how to empower people not only practically, but help them believe in possibilities. Obama brings an interesting perspective to his work on the south side of Chicago because he is both within and apart from the community he is serving. I was encouraged by his persistence in getting to know people who needed help and felt a desire to be more persistent in building relationships with those in my community who need help.Kenya made me think about family. I ended the book unsure whether family is blessing, burden or both. Obama's relationship to his family differs vastly from mine.

The news triggers a chain of memories as Barack retraces his family\u2019s unusual history: the migration of his mother\u2019s family from small-town Kansas to the Hawaiian islands; the love that develops between his mother and a promising young Kenyan student, a love nurtured by youthful innocence and the integrationist spirit of the early sixties; his father\u2019s departure from Hawaii when Barack was two, as the realities of race and power reassert themselves; and Barack\u2019s own awakening to the fears and doubts that exist not just between the larger black and white worlds but within himself.Propelled by a desire to understand both the forces that shaped him and his father\u2019s legacy, Barack moves to Chicago to work as a community organizer. There, against the backdrop of tumultuous political and racial conflict, he works to turn back the mounting despair of the inner city.

It explores vividly the times between his earlier years and his entry in the Law school in 1988.The book is divided in three parts- Origin, Chicago and Kenya.In 1959, Obama\u2019s father (Obama Sr.) arrived at the University of Hawaii as the institution\u2019s first African student from Kenya. He studied Econometrics there and in a Russian language course, he met a shy American girl Ann Dunham. They fell in love, happily married. Obama was born in 1961. His father won another scholarship to pursue his Ph.D. in Harvard- but not the money to take his family there. A separation thus occurred. Obama Sr. returned to Africa to fulfill his promise to the continent and the new born country.Ann Dunham met another man in the same University. His name was Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian. He was a short handsome gentleman. When Obama was six, Lolo returned to Indonesia and started working as a Geologist. Obama also moved to Indonesia with his mother and learned a great deal about its history and behavior. With Lolo he learned to eat plenty of rice in dinner, dog meat, snake meat, roasted grasshopper etc. Besides eating habits, he learnt a bit of boxing and some pragmatism from his stepfather like, \u201cOne must be strong. If you can\u2019t be strong, be clever and make peace with someone who is strong. But always better to be strong yourself.\u201d It shows Obama loved his company, but things got changed as his mother smelt something fishy. Ann was working in American embassy. She was somewhat idealistic in her motherhood and had great impact on Barack\u2019s conscience in his childhood. Lolo got highly involved with Indonesian elite and multinational corporations. It made Ann very upset. She was particularly upset for Barack\u2019s studies. That\u2019s why she sent Barack Hawaii back to his grandparents and later herself joined him with his half-sister Maya. Barack was enrolled here in the elite Punahou school that he didn\u2019t like seldom. Lolo was left in Indonesia.Obama Sr. paid a visit to Hawaii when Barack was ten years old. Though Barack was acquainted with him through his mother and grandparents\u2019 stories, but it was the first time he was consciously watching and interacting. Even Barack got the chance to dance with him but whenever Obama Sr. tried to exercise his authority as his father, the situation became tense. It was logical, I think. Obama Sr. returned to Kenya. It was the last time when Barack saw his father alive. Later he came to know from his step-sister Auma that this was his father\u2019s last attempt to reconcile with his mother Ann, that wasn\u2019t successful. Afterwards Ann joined college to study Anthropology and when she went to Indonesia for her fieldwork, Obama stayed with his grandparents. It was the time when Obama got a loose from her mother\u2019s influence and tries to find his own racial identity in the outer world. As the case was, Obama himself was of a mixed breed, and the skin he had resembled his father more than his mother. He couldn\u2019t escape from his African lineage. He becomes aware of the fact how much important role Race and Racism play in the lives of African Americans. He tried drugs, made friends in his community and played basketball also in his high-school team.When Obama attended the Occidental College outside of Los Angles, he got the chance to live with enlightened African American friends of his own age. In this period, he read a lot of literature about American History and Polity. Still, he wasn\u2019t satisfied or sure about his racial identity. The breakthrough in his life came when he was transferred to Columbia University during his sophomore year and there he decided that he will dedicate his life in the service of African American people. Though this was his resolution but he took a job in corporate sector and enjoyed it for a year approx. It was when he turned 21 and got the news from his step sister Auma that his father had died in a car accident in Kenya, he realized that it was the appropriate time to activate his resolution. Erstwhile, in his boyhood, his father\u2019s absence affected him negatively as he was like a myth for him, but at this mature age, he felt somewhat of loss and his father became for him a source of motivation.Obama thought what it was like to bear his father\u2019s surname while not having connection with the side of his family. This pushed him hard to get close to his African roots. That\u2019s why he chucked up his corporate job and went to Chicago to work as a community organizer.

It\u2019s difficult for me to rate this memoir because I deeply respect Barack Obama as a person. This comes at a time of deep division in the country and he remains widely appreciated by many yet politically ostracized by some. His legacy has greatly improved the lives of millions of people, but his politics leaves much to be desired. He has undeniably shaped my world views and I have come to regard him as one of the most intelligent men to ever hold that office. Dreams From My Father feels too personal, almost like I have invaded a distant corner of his heart that he has kept hidden away for too long. But he writes in descriptive, eloquent prose that is both reflective and serene.\n\u201cThe pain I felt was my father\u2019s pain. My questions were my brothers\u2019 questions. Their struggle, my birthright.\u201d\nDreams From My Father describes Obama\u2019s early experiences that influence his path into the political arena. Growing up as a mixed black man raised by a white mother and grandparents and essentially abandoned by his Kenyan father, he struggles to find his identity. This \u201cblack man with a funny name\u201d can\u2019t seem to find his niche amidst a world engulfed in superficiality. He is not white enough for white America but he isn\u2019t quite black enough for black America. This desire to find himself in a confusing society dominated by race relations affects his decision to become a community organizer in an underprivileged Chicago neighborhood and eventually travel to Kenya to understand his African heritage. Although he never really gets the opportunity to understand his father in the way that I think most young men want to, he realizes his father\u2019s greatest mistake--the loss in faith. With great power comes great responsibility and the most dangerous consequence of all is losing faith in people. \n\u201cAnd for lack of faith you clung to both too much and too little of your past. Too much of its rigidness, its suspicions, its male cruelties. Too little of the laughter in Granny\u2019s voice, the pleasures of company while herding the goats, the murmur of the market, the stories around the fire.\u201d\nBy the end you see this man for what seems to have defined the core part of his life--compassion for people. He is the reflective intellectual who organizes at the grassroots level. He is the dreamer who believes in the power of people to bring about unprecedented change. His idealism and goodness are antithetical to the seemingly prevalent corruption we see through his eyes, but they are the ideals that eventually guide him to pursue a law degree and embark on his journey into politics.

He opts for a black identity for the same reason nearly all black/white biracials do -- a white identity isn't possible when you're his color and being white requires a dimmed awareness of the reality of race.I need to explain this last sentence for the majority of people likely to read this. I\u2019ll need to unpack it: why a white identity isn\u2019t possible; what I mean by \u201chis color\u201d and what that means in the world of today; what I mean by a \u201cdimmed awareness\u201d; and what I see as the \u201creality of race\u201d.(Come to think of it, I\u2019ve used other terms that really require examination: \u201cblack\u201d, \u201cracialized\u201d, \u201cbiracial\u201d, \u201cmulticultural\u201d, \u201cheritage\u201d, \u201cidentity\u201d, and \u201cwhite\u201d.

The first characteristic \u2014 strong emotive value \u2014 makes them useful for sprinkling around in oral or written discourse to lend authority to what is said or the person saying it. The difference between keywords and\u201cbuzzwords\u201d is that keywords actually carry histories of meaning and reference to demonstrable phenomena. This complexity makes them stumbling blocks, but also makes them hard to replace by anything that might be a synonym.)\u201cYou black?

I do this by accomodating their parochialism in speech and gesture: don't talk too educated, no jokes in black dialect, tone down my gestures.The comment is a backhanded recognition of my success. Depending on the circumstance, I could go on and help them (maybe) confront those stereotypes and, just maybe, inject historical, cultural, and biological data and insights.

(Hazily reminded me, as I read it over 10 years ago.) In the first part of that book, Eco conjures the idea of archetypical readers and discusses the different ways that each reader approaches a text. As I read Dreams from My Father I read it as two different readers. First, I read it as a book lover and critic; second, as a voter. (Listed in order of priority, I must confess.)As a memoir, I thought this book was well written. It follows a coherent temporal narrative that is basically linear. But it isn't bound by chronologic time. Obama is more sophisticated than that. I felt that the beginning of the book was particularly strong because Obama doesn't try to sentimentalize his childhood memories. By treating them very matter-of-factly, he allows us much better insight into his development. We are allowed to see his ruminations about that childhood later in the narrative, in his own adulthood, when he begins to contextualize and reflect on them more deeply. He describes his years in Chicago (before Harvard Law) with an honesty that reflects his doubts, guilt and uncertainty about himself and his future. The aspect of this book that brought it down to just a \"liked it\" rather than a \"loved it\" was Obama's description of his trip to visit his family in Kenya. I felt that much of it was precious, stereotypical and not nearly as nuanced as the rest of his story. I attribute that principally to the fact that he spent so little time there and that his view of Kenya is colored by western values and American ignorance of the nations of Africa and the people who inhabit them. He did manage to avoid the typical conceit of letting one experience in one country act as a representative for understanding the whole of the continent, but not by much. It was particularly interesting because he spends a good deal of time discussing and wondering how colonialism has influenced the self-image of those who have lived with it and through it and after it but he remains interestingly ignorant of how growing up in (what I would call) an \"imperial\" culture has influenced his own interpretation of his family and Kenyans. He never really questions what his Americanness brings to his understanding, only his blackness. Which brings me to my role as a voter. I had hoped to get some idea about Obama's political and organizing experience from this book. I had also hoped it would help me identify the priciples that guide his political position so I could get an idea of what his priorities are or will be for the country. The book doesn't really address either of those things. Of course, it's not meant to. This is a \"memoir\" of a man who is barely middle-aged. This is just volume one of \"the Obama story\". As a voter, I felt that it helped me to get to know the man as a person. And as a voter, I couldn't give a rat's ass about the man as a person. For example: I was shocked that he admitted to using cocaine as a young man in such a cavalier way but I cannot honestly say it will effect my vote or my opinion of him as public servant.

I have the political knowledge of the average young teenager.One of this year's POPSUGAR challenge categories was a political memoir - Barack Obama was the only political figure I could think of who I was interested enough in to have any desire to read a memoir of. I don't like politics and feel like most politicians will say whatever they need to in order to get themselves elected and then feel free to do what they want once they're in, but that's not how I saw Obama. I like Obama, I would have voted for him if I had been given the chance (both times) and now that his time is nearly up I feel sad for him that he was blocked from making so many of the changes that he wanted to make. I felt like he honestly wanted to make his country better for minorities and those who slip through the gaps in the health and education systems and the senate blocked all his attempts simply because he wasn't from the same party as they were, as opposed to them actually thinking that what he was trying to do was a bad idea (put simply, they blocked his proposals out of spite).Reading this memoir, written 14 years before he was elected president, was very interesting. How and where he grew up, his slightly fractured childhood and his 'relationship' with his father, mostly through other family members after his father's death. In the chapters set during his time in Kenya there were a lot of family members and I kept getting their exact relationship to Obama confused, my reading of this would have benefitted from a list of family members and how they were related to Obama at the back/beginning of the book.If this book was re-re-released with a third introduction from soon-to-be former President Obama I would be happy to read it again (it was re-released in 2004 after he was elected to the senate with a new introduction and that's the edition I read) as I wonder how the events of his life since he wrote the book would differ from 20 years ago.

However, I did intend to read it eventually so when one of my book clubs chose it I checked it out.In the preface, Obama says that his mother died a few months before the book was published, and had she been gone while he was writing the book would have been very different.

However, it is the children of these immigrants who seek authenticity in forgotten and disregarded ethnic traditions, in search of their roots, of an identity. \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s autobiography recounts the odyssey Obama embarks upon, in hopes of discovering community and family, and ultimately himself.  Obama immediately whisks the reader into his atypical childhood, allowing one to experience firsthand, the trials and tribulations facing a cultural outsider, the offspring of a white mother and an African father, trapped between two dissimilar cultures. The readers travels alongside Obama and his peripatetic family, from the grasslands of Kansas to the white beaches of Hawaii, from Indonesia to Obama\u2019s days as a campus activist in Los Angles, to his years serving as a community organizer in Chicago, and on to his arrival in his father\u2019s birthplace of Kenya. Through his travels, Barack critically evaluates the battles confronting black Americans and intimately articulates his personal struggles to find his place in a world of black and white. He eloquently channels his anger and alienation into a fierce determination that later changed neighborhoods, and may well change the nation. \tFeeling out of place in high school, Obama gravitates toward the black kids and works to embrace an African-American culture that matches others' expectations of his appearance, but is different from his upbringing and background. After graduating college, Obama sets off in search of community and purpose, with the great role models of the civil rights movement. However, the glory days of the civil rights movement were long gone when Obama gets an organizing job in a poor neighborhood on Chicago's South Side plagued by crumbling public housing, disappearing manufacturing jobs, and rising crime. During this time spent in Chicago, Obama develops a mix of idealism, political perceptiveness, and personal connection, later serving as the origins of his political career. Obama catalogs the ambiguities and subtleties of African-American identity, while relentlessly searching for his own. He constantly ponders his origin, \u201cI was hoping you could tell. The name's Obama. Where do I belong?\u201d (115). Barack insightfully illustrates the dilemmas challenging the livelihoods of African Americans. \tThis memoir follows Barack as he defines himself and his perspective on the world and finally finds himself welcomed into the community of humanity. One remains fully engaged as he/she embarks on Baracks\u2019s journey into adulthood, addressing the concerns surrounding increasingly multicultural societies and individual attempts to navigate a constantly changing world. Obama struggles to be true to himself, but in order to do so, he must first figure out what that truly means.

Hard not to feel nostalgic, looking back....we've gone from a president who wrote four hundred pages of cerebral reflection on race and inheritance in this little experiment we call America to a populist freakshow reality show host who may well be illiterate. Times like these, man.  Anyways, onto the book itself. I will admit without shame now that I am 1) very liberal and not at all interested in pretending to be nonpartisan, and 2) a pretty strident Obama supporter. Politics aside, the man is a beautiful speaker and an exceptional speechwriter; in the pantheon of American orators, he's gotta be among the greats. So I had fairly high expectations for this book. ...and was a little disappointed, honestly. The story is good, and his background is certainly interesting and unique enough to provide a compelling narrative with meaningful insights into what it means to be an American, what it means to be black, what it means to be white. But the writing itself was often overwrought, occasionally even pretentious, and the introspection sometimes veered uncomfortably into self-indulgent navel-gazing. It also could have been about a hundred pages shorter. It's also interesting that he seemed to be so obsessed with the idea of fatherhood and maleness when the strongest and most productive forces in his life appeared to be women: his mother, his grandmother, his sister Auma, the Chicago women who helped him get his community organizing projects off the ground. He spent so long chasing after this romantic fantasy of a father figure that represented authority and power and charisma and seemed to take for granted the reality of the women truly embodying those very qualities right in front of his eyes.But it wasn't bad. I mostly enjoyed it. He's a talented guy and a talented writer, especially when he stops trying so hard and just keeps it simple. If you're gonna read a politician's autobiography, this is probably a good option. If for no other reason, it'll be a nice reminder in the coming years that we once had a president who could communicate in full sentences. \n(2016 PS Reading Challenge: An autobiography.)\n", "num_likes": 9, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["nonfiction", "2016-ps-reading-challenge"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/10752217", "review_id": "10752217", "date": "Dec 20, 2007", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Ganesh", "user_url": "/user/show/62081-ganesh", "text": "When Barack Obama\u2019s father was a young man, he went with his father-in-law and friends to a bar in Hawaii where a man loudly complained about having to sit \u201cnext to a nigger.\u201d \u201cThe room fell quiet and people turned to my father, expecting a fight. Instead, my father stood up, walked over to the man, smiled, and proceeded to lecture him about the folly of bigotry, the promise of the American dream, and the universal rights of man.\u201dThe man apologized, and he tried to show how sorry he was by giving Obama\u2019s father a hundred dollars. This story expanded my idea of what is possible. I was inspired by Obama's father strength of spirit and by the bar patron who listened to him, let go of his prejudices, and was able to see their common humanity. The story healed a part of me that was broken, a part of me that had grown afraid over the last seven years to hope that people could change. Obama's campaign fills me with such hope for the future -- hope that the federal government will establish universal health care, repair our relations with other countries, and finally begin to seriously address climate change. It has given me hope that we could have a president who listens to us. These challenges we face are great, and we need everyone to get involved to create stronger, greener, healthier communities. What impresses me the most about Obama is his ability to empower others with the belief that their actions do make a difference. The record turnouts at primaries is a testament to his power to inspire action. His message has motivated one of my friends in Massachusetts to organize her college campus and another friend in California to serve as precinct captain. When I read Obama's Myspace page, I am moved by the young people of color who write that he has inspired them to pursue careers in public service. Obama and his millions of enthusiastic supporters have inspired me to make a donation, phone bank, and, on Tuesday, I will vote in my first primary.

It is to a large degree a story of Barack Obama discovering his own roots, particularly those of his father and grandfather in Kenya and to a lesser degree some of his half-siblings. Obama we know was raised by his white mother and her parents in Hawaii and only met his father once after he was an infant.The book is separated into three sections: Origins, Chicago, and Kenya. The section on Origins covers the years of his childhood in Hawaii. This was my least favorite part of the book and structurally disorganized. The writing even seemed different from the other sections as many of the paragraphs alternate between past and present tense with little context in between. Most of the stories from his youth relate to some form of alienation and teen angst. There seemed to be few lasting friendships with peers and a lot of time spent reading books by Baldwin, Ellison, Wright and Du Bois. He also listened closely to the family stories told by his mother and grandfather about his Kenyan father. There were not many poignant moments here except that a young Barack did become close with his grandfather\u2019s friends at the neighborhood pub and pool hall. I found these pages some of the most enlightening and perhaps provide some validation that he was quite mature for his age.Chicago was far and away my favorite section of the book. This section covers Obama\u2019s time as a community organizer in Chicago in the mid 1980\u2019s after he graduated from Columbia University in New York. I was struck at how difficult the job of a community organizer is and that Obama stuck with it for three years before applying to Harvard law school. It is evident from this reading that Barack had little idea about his future then. Previously in New York and then while living in Chicago he described the hours he spent just walking the city streets. It is also clear that he is the kind of person who needs to experience places first hand. In one story, while walking on the South Side of Chicago, he and a work colleague hit the deck as a youth runs by firing shots at a group of pursuing youths who promptly return fire. In another story, a minister is helping the Obama get funding but casually requests that Obama hire his wife and daughter as community organizers first. But most of this section were the stories of disillusionment. Many young people growing up on the South Side had few life options in this period of high unemployment, violence and drug use. If you want to understand Barack Obama and some of core political philosophy - I think this is critical period of his life. It is also this period when he is introduced to Rev Wright. Years later when Obama would run for the presidency he would have to sever his ties with Rev. Wright \u2014 who was considered by much of the press to be a radical The last section of the book is entitled Kenya. This is the crux of the memoir and is also quite good. Obama travels to Kenya, when he is 27, for the first time and meets with his extended family. In his travels and from his family he learns the more complete story of his father and paternal grandparents - although only his grandmother is still living at this point. He learns from these stories why his father was such a difficult person. He learns about customs in Kenya that made pluralistic marriages, like his father\u2019s, effectively possible. And why his father effectively abandoned him and his mother. He learns about his grandfather\u2019s disappointment in his father\u2019s decision to marry the white girl in Hawaii in the first place. We learn about the white British imperialists in 1950\u2019s Kenya who had such a hold on his grandfather. Obama talks of the disappointment when he finds out that his grandfather did not stand up to the British. This is the most visceral section of the memoir. 4 stars. David Remnick\u2019s biography of Barack Obama is a better written and more comprehensive biography than this memoir. With that said the Chicago section of this book, when Barack Obama was a community organizer, I found to be the most enlightening and not covered in my other readings.

I don't ever want someone to take a look at one of my reviews and think that equals me hating their life, but in some cases not all memoirs are the same. Luckily, for the most part I really liked this one. Prior to becoming President of the United States, Barack Obama wrote the first of his memoirs. At the time he was preparing to launch his campaign to run for the Senate in Illinois. We have President Obama providing details on his parents courtship (Barack Obama, Sr. of Kenya, and Ann Dunham of Wichita, Kansas) after they meet at the University of Hawaii. For a time the couple was happy, but eventually his father left and eventually divorced his mother when President Obama was two years old. I have to say that reading about President Obama's upbringing by his grandparents and mother in Hawaii was fascinating. You can read his push/pull to figure out where he belonged, what did it mean to be half-white and half black in Hawaii.He had several internal discussions with himself on what to do with his half-Kenyan side since that part of his father's family was separate from him for the most part. When President Obama's father eventually comes to stay with them again for a month when he was a child, I could feel the tension that he felt, and the sadness that his mother felt as well for not being able to work things out with this man that definitely seemed so big. When we get past his recollections of college and working I was happy to read more about his family that lives in Kenya. I thought the writing was very good, but will say that the flow was hit or miss at times. I think that anytime President Obama strayed away from his family I found myself losing interest. Reading about his struggles in high school, college, and eventually when he is living and working in New York and Chicago did not come as a surprise to me. I think that any black woman or man that is one of the first people in their family to graduate college/grad school or obtains a high paying job deals with \"black guilt\". You feel guilty for making something of yourself and you feel guilty for not feeling tied to people that you used to know or even your own family. It is definitely a double edged sword. The settings of Hawaii and Indonesia came very much alive when President Obama was reliving his childhood in both places. He has a very deft way of describing people and places that worked for this memoir. The parts of the book that dealt with his Kenyan family were sad in a lot of places. You get to read more about his father and ultimately the strained relationships among some of the relatives and you get more understanding about Kenya and how marriages worked in that country during that time. I say during that time but for all I know that is still the way that marriages work now. The ending though I felt was a little abrupt. I am very glad that I read this book and would recommend to anyone wanting to know more about President Obama.

That said, Dreams from My Father is still a well-written and insightful memoir, describing the fascinating past of the current US president. Coincidentally, I had just finished reading Christopher Hitchens' last memoir, Mortality, in which he wrote:\n\"To my writing classes I used later to open by saying that anybody who could talk could also write\",\nand this book written after Obama was elected as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review(an achievement that prompted a number of offers from publishers anxious to print his \"rags-to-riches esque\" story)seems to support this notion. Obama's fluid and descriptive prose demonstrate he's not only a skillful orator but also a skillful writer. Though (for the most part) raised by his white mother and her parents in Hawaii, he still identified with his Afro American heritage, probably because of his appearance, and in the book he discusses his childhood, his time as a community organizer, and his trip to Kenya prior to starting law school, a trip in which he finally meets his estranged African family. Most of the book is spent exploring his struggles growing up as a young, fatherless, black man who is trying to make sense of the injustices of this world, many racially fueled, coupled with a desire to learn more about the \"African\" father he barely knew.Written prior to his political career, it seems to offer an honest insight into Obama the man, an honesty that would unlikely prevail during a political campaign.Agree with his political ideologies or not, there's a lot here to appreciate as his story is a rather exceptional one.I would recommend this to those who want to learn more about Obama, and/or those who are interested in the issues men and women of color face in a world where darker skin tones are still seen as a sign of inferiority, not only in American society but also around the world.", "num_likes": 8, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["non-fiction", "read-in-2013"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/18942751", "review_id": "18942751", "date": "Mar 29, 2008", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Nancy", "user_url": "/user/show/803323-nancy", "text": "This was a hard book for me to \u201crate.\u201d It is difficult to untangle the book from all the publicity on the presidential candidate.

I realize this visit was a big part of what gave him the opportunity to write a memoir as such a young age. It had to be in there. However, I wished for more on his life in America including the influences of his time at Harvard Law School. I felt I was just getting to know what makes him tick when the book veered off onto a story about a family that had no influence in forming him.

Well, having never previously read the autobiography of a politician, this book was a pleasant surprise in lots of ways. Who'd have thought his family was more complicated than mine (as one of my friends commented last night!). I was seriously losing track of brothers, (sisters were easy - just the 2) and to still be meeting new ones right up till the end was amazing. Let alone uncles, step-uncles and aunts, grandmothers and step-grandmothers and so on and on! There were so many poignant bits - like, having been abandoned by his father, his mother remarrying and then moving to Indonesia for several years. It wasn't till he came back to Hawaii to go to school that he noticed that people minded what colour his skin was. And sometimes even his own grandparents. The return of his father when he was about 10, briefly, and that that was the last time he ever saw him. There's a great photo of that here.The subsequent striving to meet expectations - those he'd imposed on himself, and those he took on board from his father. And all the time to not know/understand what a disaster his father had made of his own life. He may have had an \"easy charm with the women\", and certainly managed to procreate abundantly hither and yon, but in spite of all that he was lousy at communicating with any of them - wives, children, siblings, parents. Serious intimacy issues. Probably no more than a man of his time, but to hear the story from his family, quite an extreme case. The work as a community organiser, in Chicago - not a concept I'd come across before, but total grass-roots, justice-seeking stuff. And so the book comes to a conclusion, with \"Barry\" sitting between the graves of his father and grandfather, weeping. \"When my tears were finally spent, I felt a calmness wash over me,\" he writes. \"I felt the circle finally close. I realized that who I was, what I cared about, was no longer just a matter of intellect or obligation, no longer a construct of words. I saw that my life in America -- the black life, the white life, the sense of abandonment I'd felt as a boy, the frustration and hope I'd witnessed in Chicago -- all of it was connected with this small plot of earth an ocean away, connected by more than the accident of a name or the color of my skin.

Clearly his race is one of the most obvious factors in that change, but in reading his story in his own words, I have to say it goes far beyond just race. His story is very honest and vulnerable. He's extremely open about his life and far less guarded than the presidential authors I've read up to this point.

There is certainly a biographical component to the book, but not in a strict sense to where the time line is linear. The former President jumps around from situation to situation, zeroing in on key moments during his early years. The writing is clear and engaging, almost reading like fiction in some parts. Written in the middle 1990s, long before he became President, he is candid and open to a degree that would have been nearly impossible had he tried to write this after rising to the pinnacle of world leadership. The first part of the book focuses on his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, but mainly in Hawaii. Much of this focuses on his relationship with his mother and grandparents (all white) and him trying to learn how to cope with his race. Just like when he was running for President and when he was in office, race was an issue when he was growing up: not to the level that it would have been had he been in most other areas of the United States as Hawaii's laid-back culture and large Asian population pushed black-white issues somewhat to the back burner. But he still felt isolated from the predominantly white culture in America, gravitating to the few other blacks that he went to high school with. This had to have been a difficult book to write \u2013 he does not attempt to portray himself in the best light possible. Few people have the courage to be so honest in front of the world. But the things that he does that are cringe-inducing really aren't much different than what most of us do as we are struggling through adolescence. You are not always kind, you do not always appreciate sage advice, sometimes you are deliberately mean or selfish (at least in isolated moments), and you are oftentimes at war with yourself. Perhaps Obama opening up about these things is what helps make this so interesting to read, because while certainly most of it is uniquely his story, some of it can apply to most youths. Despite his absence from his life, Obama's father seems to loom over him the older he gets. Obama never really knew him, and spent only a few weeks around him when his father visited Hawaii. Clearly this is something that Obama regrets, yet it was not his doing. His parents divorced when he was very young, and his father returned to Africa. That literally is the other side of the world from Hawaii. Obama then had to move to Indonesia with his mother and lived there for several years before returning to Hawaii. He begins the book with saying that he received a phone call that his father had died in a car accident in Kenya, but then digresses from it and goes into his youth and adolescence, only to end the first part of the book by circling all the way back around to that moment. The second part of the book is mainly about Obama's first few years in Chicago as a community organizer. This was in the mid 1980s, while Harold Washington was Mayor \u2013 the first black Mayor in the city's history. Obama moved there after quitting his job in New York. He does not really explain why he did that, but obviously he was not happy with what he was doing. Once in Chicago, he continued in his search to find out who he really was. I know that now he refers to Chicago as his hometown, but I certainly did not get that feeling from the book. It seems like he viewed it as a temporary stepping stone to somewhere/something else in life. The final section deals with his trip to Nairobi, Kenya in an attempt to connect with his father's side of the family. Once again, as with Hawaii, Indonesia, New York, and Chicago, Obama feels like an outsider. He quickly learns that, much like many other people experience all over the world, his family in Africa is dysfunctional. His father had multiple wives and many children. When his father died, his estate was contested by some of his former wives and their offspring. Also, the aunts, uncles, and cousins also got involved. Obama seems happy to try to connect with his paternal roots, and his relationship with his half-sister Auma is a definite plus. Yet he is quite dismayed at the money-grubbing aspect of many of his relatives, and how the opportunities available to make oneself better in Africa are limited There were so many relatives that popped up in this section of the book that it became difficult to keep them all separated. Obama probably felt the same way!This really is an interesting look at Obama before he became President. At times, he seems a bit over-dramatic in recreating some conversations, and one wonders how accurate all of the dialogue is, although I suspect the essence of the conversations is what he was after. Obviously, Obama's story is uniquely his own. And yet, there are some things that connect him with regular people, because he was just another lost soul trying to find his way: sleeping in an alleyway in Manhattan on his first night there because he had no money, using public transportation, trying to conserve money, having issues with some of his coworkers in Chicago. At least for me, it helped me to gain a better understanding of the person who inhabited the Oval Office for eight years. Obviously, he is not the same person now, after what he has experienced in public office. Nobody would be. But these early experiences are still a part of him and no doubt influenced the decisions that he made while President. This is essential to anyone interested in reading about/understanding Obama.

Perhaps it's because I've taken a similar sort of pilgrimage, a return to a native yet unknown land, and found not the clarity or resolutation that Obama did. Strands of bougainvillea dress the walls of a hut in a rural compound, he tells us, but I'd bet a dollar that he couldn't recognize bougainvillea, that in fact he couldn't name any of the plants in Kenya by sights. That later, when he was reviewing notes or editing gallery proofs he had to phone Auma and ask for the name of those flowers in the family photograph, and anyway, Wikipedia says they are native to South America.This skepticism comes, I know, from jealousy. Barack Obama has set out his ghosts on paper, whereas mine come in the scattered form of almost-irreverent thoughts when particularly provoked. Furthermore, his approach and his style broadcast elegance and integrity: in what I suppose is a good mark of a legal scholar, he argues with himself at every turn, failure, or quandary. In the foreword, a short comment on the national stardom that began to bloom years after the first run of his book, Obama notes that some details and proper nouns have been conflated for simplcity's sake.Fine, then.

Born to a white American mother and a black African father, raised in Hawai'i and Indonesia and the Midwest, he had the problems common to a lot of multiracial or third culture kids--asking the question \"who am I?\" and not really having an answer. He's not white, obviously. He learned that lesson growing up. But when he spends time on the South Side of Chicago doing community organizing, the black people he works with point out how different he is from them as well, having lived abroad and then in Hawai'i, and they're quick to point out that he showed up to help them but he'll go on to other things. And they're right, because he gets in to Harvard Law School. After all of Obama's talk about hope and what binds Americans together during his presidency, it was incredibly refreshing to see him talk about hopelessness and the reality of racism. The people of Chicago's South Side suffer from institutional neglect, even after Harold Washington's election as mayor when they think that now they might finally have a chance. There's a chapter about asbestos in apartments, and how local residents in Altgeld go to ask about testing. They are told that tests showed no asbestos, and when, encouraged by Obama, they ask for a copy of the test results, it quickly becomes obvious that tests were never done. They arrange a meeting with the head of the Chicago Housing Authority, but the meeting turns into shouting and nothing productive comes from it. There are matter-of-fact lines like:Segregation wasn't much of an issue anymore; whites had all but abandoned the system.I don't blame Obama the president for not speaking as much on racial issues, especially if it was a tactical choice. There's some evidence that just mentioning that Trayvon Martin looked like him convinced some former Obama voters to vote for Trump. But when comparing to this Obama, who flirts with black nationalism before wondering how it can be maintained as a minority and what exactly that means, the change is stark.And that's why he goes to Africa, to meet his relatives and track down the people who knew his father. And he learns he doesn't really belong in Africa either--he doesn't speak the language, as his grandmother laments when they are alone without his sister Auma to translate and after she says \"hello\" and he says \"muwasa,\" they've exhausted their mutual vocabulary. Language is culture, which is why tyrants try so hard to force linguistic uniformity, and why it's so hard to maintain a minority culture when the language is lost. He's among family, but there are many of them he can't speak to.There's a part at the end, where one of Obama's relatives is talking about black Americans who come to Africa seeking \"authenticity\" and what that means. Kenyans love offering visitors tea, but tea is a British import. Many of the small businesses in Nairobi are owned by South Asians. What does African authenticity mean in that case? What is purity in a world with constant connections and exchanges, and what does that mean for someone caught between two worlds? When Obama learned about his grandfather, that he went to work for the British as soon as he could, his first thought is \"Uncle Tom.\" But is it just that his grandfather recognized which way the wind was blowing? And isn't that similar to what Obama himself had to do, to find his way in a society that looked down on him due to the color of his skin. That he could try to change it, but in the meantime he had to live in it. I was pretty disillusioned with Obama after his second term and all his attempts to reach out to a Republican Party that almost immediately started trying to sabotage him and have now descended into fascism. If anything this book makes that worse, but it makes me more sympathetic to younger Obama. I wonder what the path he took from that to the point where he said that in the 80s, he'd be considered a moderate Republican based on his economic policies.

Like many Europeans, I'm a fan of Barack Obama - due to both his political views and his personal charisma (with which his political views carry all the more weight). I was therefore intrigued to learn that he was a published writer long before he became President of the United States, and I was curious to get a peek into aspects of his life, as he himself would present them.Written years before he became the most powerful person on the planet (acc. to Forbes, February 2013; hardly surprising), Obama's autobiography/memoir is an account of how he set out to explore his past and come to terms with his mixed parentage in an America characterized by racism and inequality. His journey takes him from Kansas to Hawaii, then to Indonesia and to Chicago, and finally to Kenya.He is clearly gifted as a writer and, as we know from his years as president, has the ability to capture people's hearts with his words, his commitment and his honesty. But I also felt, at least in the first half of the book, that there was a certain self-rightenousness and Malcolm X - like anger which shines through in the storytelling. Everything seems to be about race; surely there are other things, as well,, that define a person. (He himself admits to an obsession with race). And, again at least in the first half of the book, he divides the world into black and white - both figuratively and physically.It was moving to read about his childhood, interesting to hear about his turmoil growing up with a white mother and a black father, who wasn't present in his life. But too much space was dedicated to his job as a beginning organizer in the Chicago projects; it was no doubt crucial to him and his future career as a politician, but it fills more than half the book. His trip to Africa and his paternal roots were interesting from a different, more cultural, perspective.I felt at times that he was too much on the rampage - aggressive and defensive at the same time, but then again this was apparently a very real part of growing up under his circumstances (and for many other blacks in America). There are also lots and lots of passages about other people and their dialogs, as remembered, and less about him, but of course he comes to understand himself through all these other people, incl. Reverend Wright, who coined the terme 'The Audacity of Hope' - the title of Obama's subsequent book, and who eventually married Michelle and him.Despite the sometimes brutal honesty (e.g. admitting to doing drugs in his youth), it never seems delivered with a twinkle in his eye; it is self-critical but never self-deprecating in a humourous way, which makes this book seem more serious and somber than the person I've seen on TV. On the other hand, the language itself is often illustrative of an imaginative mind that is not always bogged down in the problems of the world. (I particularly loved this phrase, for instance: ...police cars passed by in barracuda silence).All in all, this book is a severely honest insight into the makings of one of the leading figures of our time, his coming of age, fear of not belonging and search for identity.

As others have commented, this book is rather unusual in that it was written long before there was any possibility of Obama becoming president, so it\u2019s written with unusual candor for a politician. Barack, unvarnished. Generally speaking, I can still recognize the voice as his, but there are marked differences between the Barack we got to know as president and the Barack of this book. I tend to think of Barack-the-president as gentle, even-tempered, moderate (at least, moderate compared to me). Maybe it\u2019s just a product of youth, but the younger Barack is far more radical. He\u2019s also more . . . well, relatable. This anecdote was one of my favourite parts about the book, because it portrays him as an awkward college kid who\u2019s trying way too hard to look cool and ends up looking like a jerk instead\u2014totally unexpected image. I liked this story because it goes to show that even the most composed and thoughtful among us have memories of putting their foot in their mouths. The story: Barack was with a friend in college, Marcus, \u201cthe most conscious of brothers.\u201d To Barack, Marcus was the epitome of a young, cool, politically aware black man, with plenty of authentic black experience and authority\u2014in short, everything Barack wanted to be. Being around Marcus made Barack \u201cfeel like a younger brother who will always be one step behind.\u201dAnother friend, Tim, came into the room to ask Barack a question about homework. Tim was decidedly \u201cnot a conscious brother\u201d; he wore argyle sweaters, talked like Beaver Cleaver, had a white girlfriend, and listened to country music. When Tim left the room, Barack (embarrassed by his friendship with Tim) said, \u201cTim\u2019s a trip, ain\u2019t he. Should change his name from Tim to Tom.\u201d To which Marcus replied, \u201cWhy you say that, man? Tim seems all right to me. He\u2019s going about his business. Don\u2019t bother nobody. Seems to me we should be worrying about whether our own stuff\u2019s together instead of passing judgment on how other folks are supposed to act.\u201d Cue Barack\u2019s intense sense of shame and awkwardness. I\u2019ve been there, Barack. Props to you for the candor. * * *Another thing of note: several chapters of the book are devoted to Barack\u2019s time in Chicago, where a man named Harold Lee Washington had recently been elected as the first black mayor. I thought it was interesting how Washington\u2019s election parallelled Obama\u2019s own election, many years later. In the book, one person says of the night Washington was elected, \u201cPeople just ran the streets. It was like the day Joe Louis knocked out Schmeling. Same feeling. People weren\u2019t just proud of Harold. They were proud of themselves. I stayed inside, but my wife and I, we couldn\u2019t get to bed until three, we were so excited. When i woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life.\u201d Now, I can\u2019t speak to what it was like as a POC during that election, but I still remember that high-strung excitement, not being able to sleep, the sense of pride. It\u2019s so strange to think about the fact that, as Barack wrote this book, that day was still decades down the line, that nobody could have predicted that moment. * * *I loved meeting Auma, Barack\u2019s half-sister (same dad, Barack senior). Though many of Barack\u2019s Kenyan relatives were introduced in the final section of the book, Auma was definitely my favourite. I\u2019d have been interested to know more about Maya (Barack\u2019s half-sister from his mom) who he grew up with; Maya only appears as a few lines here and there. * * *I\u2019ll close with two quotes I enjoyed immensely.On law school: \u201cThe study of law can be disappointing at times, a matter of applying narrow rules and arcane procedure to an uncooperative reality . . . but that\u2019s not all the law is. The law is also memory; the law also records a long-running conversation, a nation arguing with its conscience.\u201dOn a gathering in a community church in Chicago: \u201cIn that single note\u2014hope!\u2014I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion\u2019s den, Ezekiel\u2019s field of dry bones. Those stories\u2014of survival, freedom, and hope\u2014became our story, my story; the blood that had spilled was our blood, the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world. Our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black; in chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didn\u2019t need to feel shamed about, memories that all people might study and cherish\u2014and with which we could start to rebuild. And if a part of me continued to feel that this Sunday communion sometimes simplified our condition, that it could sometimes disguise or suppress the very real conflicts among us and would fulfill its promise only through action, I also felt for the first time how that spirit carried within it, nascent, incomplete, the possibility of moving beyond our narrow dreams.\u201d", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3870254125", "review_id": "3870254125", "date": "Mar 03, 2021", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Jeanette Grant-Thomson", "user_url": "/user/show/49586099-jeanette-grant-thomson", "text": "Four and a half stars.

I ended up being pleasantly surprised by Dreams From My Father, though I think the fact that I am reading it 25 years after it was first published and after I already knew a lot about him, makes the experience much different than it would have been had I read it in 2005 when I first heard of him. When Obama was first running for president and subsequently elected, I thought he was an empty suit. I thought it was hilarious that he already had two memoirs despite having a relatively ordinary life up to that point. I assumed it spoke to his ego and general bombasity that fed his cult following. What did he have to say that could be so important that it warranted two books at this point in his life? Obviously, nothing. By the time I was aware of Dreams From My Father, we were probably 35 years into the absurdly long 2008 election cycle. His message of \u201chope and change\u201d was transparently and embarrassingly vague, so I knew that Mr. Obama was all style and no substance. And to be honest, I think if I had read this book at the time, it probably would have mostly reinforced my views about him as a supposed intellectual. There is nothing in this book in terms of policy or ideology that is unique or thought provoking. But for me reading Obama\u2019s first memoir, which was written ten years before he won his Senate seat, helped me understand him and his popularity in 2008.My main issue with this book is how vague it is. Like the 2008 presidential candidate, he leaves much to the imagination. When someone is generally likable but not well-known, there\u2019s a tendency to fill the unknown with positive assumptions. You don\u2019t assume a generally good-looking, successful person orders their steak well-done, backs into angled parking spots, listens to Nickelback, or whatever other negative attributes regular people have. You assume the best. If done right, an unknown person will be more likable with less information. In 2008, the \u201chope and change\u201d slogan benefited from ambiguity because every person who supported Obama had a different definition of what that meant. There was no need for him to be specific. Had he been, he would have lost support.Similarly, in Dreams From My Father, Obama inexplicably leaves out information that would seem very natural to include. In his college years, he mentions being influenced by books. Which books? How did they influence him? He might include some minor details, but overall he is incredibly vague. If I wrote a book about my life and included some information about my political and intellectual evolution, I could name a few books that have strongly influenced me and how. That leads me to assume that the reason he doesn't mention many books by title is because if he did, it would hurt his image. It is better to say you are influenced by books than to admit that the book that influenced you was written by Noam Chomsky or Howard Zinn. It would be even worse to admit that what influenced your intellectual development wasn't a book at all, your pothead friends or a pretty girl you were trying to date (Obama does admit to a little bit of the latter).Whatever the reason, there is a lot of substance missing from this book. It is as if Obama wanted to write a political book without talking about politics. In some ways it is very strange and it is difficult to understand what Obama's actual beliefs are and what motivates those beliefs. For example, we know he is against poverty, but we don\u2019t know what he wants to do about it. It is easy to agree with someone who is against poverty, but it is the proposed solutions that people fight over. Although he mostly avoids political substance, the one glaring issue I have in terms of policy occured during a section dedicated to his community organizing efforts in Chicago during the 1980s. He stated several times that he thought black people should be discouraged from leaving Chicago. Maybe he holds different ideas about this issue now, but I think this is generally terrible advice. It is a mistake similar to that of people who are against school choice and immigration. The level of change that is necessary to fix a broken institution is substantial and difficult to execute. Fixing a broken school, city, or country is very difficult and time consuming. It's much easier to move people to a place that's already working well. People who are seeking improvement need immediate change. They don\u2019t have the luxury to wait decades while a bunch of bureaucrats tinker with ideas with inconsistent outcomes. The people he encouraged to stay in Chicago in the 1980s, assuming they listened to his advice, are likely still suffering from many of the same problems. Had they moved to greener pastures, say the Mountain West or West Coast, they probably would have done better relatively quickly.That is literally the only disagreement I had with Obama in this entire book. It is actually quite remarkable. The vast majority of what he talks about is the relationships he has with his various family members. If you know Obama\u2019s story, you know his family situation growing up was not traditional in any way and quite complicated. Obama explains some of these arrangements, and though I admit I kind of lost track of all the intricacies at times, it was generally interesting and at times inspiring.I think my takeaway from this book (and I already came to this conclusion a while ago) was that Obama wasn\u2019t an empty suit. I might not like him or his style, but that definitely says more about me than him. I just don\u2019t like politicians and assume their popularity is due to style and tribal nonsense rather than substance. But I have come to respect the fact that I don\u2019t think that is possible in real life. As vapid as politicians appear, at some point they had to actually accomplish something. I also thought Trump was an empty suit, but in his and Obama\u2019s cases, these guys understand people and America (at least a certain segment of America) much better than I do. I thought both were unelectable but they proved to be highly popular in their own ways. I always thought Obama was too calculating in terms of his image, and I do think the lack of candor in this book proves that. I am not positive, but I would guess he wrote this book with the thought in the back of his head that he didn\u2019t want to include any info that could hurt his future electability. And as calculating as he appears to be, that sort of strategy only goes so far. Fundamentally, he understands his constituency and was an excellent coalition builder. One of the slight issues I had with this book is I thought the book actually suffered from the chronological storytelling. Dreams From My Father ends with Obama crying at the graves of his father and grandfather in their ancestral home in Kenya. It is a beautiful moment, but I think some foreshadowing of this at the beginning of the book would have helped the narrative build to that conclusion in a more satisfying way. For a memoir of a president, I would consider this an exceptional book. For one, I think the uniqueness of this being written before Obama was well-known is fascinating. Yes, there is clearly a strong filter over his story in this book, but Dreams From My Father lacks the pettiness and bitterness that one would expect to read in a book by a seasoned politician. He generally avoids concrete politics completely which is nice since most people reading this book already know the political arguments. There is nothing to gain by Obama bringing any of this up. The lack of politics means that even if you aren\u2019t a fan of Obama, you can appreciate his story. I actually think this should be made into a movie, and if done right, it could be truly great. I give this book four stars, probably five if you are a big Obama fan.", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/11105684", "review_id": "11105684", "date": "Dec 27, 2007", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Leonora", "user_url": "/user/show/33019-leonora", "text": "I enjoyed this autobiography very much. I read it in 24 hours, interspersed with work and sleep, and I was really carried along by Obama's story and ideas. It was deeper than I thought it would be. It's about a search for himself (and his father) and his transformation from innocent Hawaiin boy to angry college student to idealist Chicago organizer was painful and endearing and familiar. His ideas about race were uniquely expressed (to my ears anyway) and thought-provoking. More than ever, I believe he's genuine. His time in Chicago was most interesting. He wasn't put off by setbacks while helping to organize in South Side. To me, the reason he accomplished the things he did was because he became a member of the community. The church he currently attends is in the neighborhood. Obama's perceptions of people are at once incisive and forgiving. So, instead of being put off by the self-aggrandizing preacher or lying public official, he understands where they're coming from. This is an incredible quality. It's why, I think, he's a successful deal-maker with other Senators and I think this would serve him well as President.Speaking of the race, it's amazing that he wrote this in 1995, after just graduating from Harvard Law School. Toward the end of the book, as he puts forth his ideas (whereas most of the book is experiences, thoughts, and conversations), he sounds like himself today. Perhaps he thought all along of becoming President and didn't write that in the book; in any case, it seems clear that he has a Presidential quality, and it comes from idealism rather than a gluttony for power. Although, after making a speech in college, he mentions how much he liked speaking in public. He comes across as quite a man: thoughtful, intelligent, wise. He reminds me of other incredible men I have known like my grandfather and father. He himself tries to live up to the example of his father. Maybe this story is universal in that sense.There were only two things I found off-putting. One was that while he talks about the complex thoughts he's had about race, his father, his mother, etc., he never says \"I felt\" this or \"I really didn't want to do\" that. He puts his experiences into words beautifully, but not so much his feelings. The other thing was that I felt the book ended abruptly. I wanted to read about his conversion to Christianity and he leaves us hanging in the church. I wanted to hear more about Harvard Law and how he reconciled what he learned there with what he learned in South Side. But all in all, this is a really good book. He mentions being drawn to Malcom X's autobiography and like that book, I'll probably read this one again. His experiences are electrifying, certain passages beautiful, and his thoughts are unsentimental, yet idealistic. The perfect combination.

I listened to the memoir and I really enjoyed listening to Barack Obama's voice as he recounted his childhood, his teenager years, his experience with his family and his experience with race. The book is split into 6 chapters which made this book drag a little as each chapter felt a little bit long with each chapter being nearly an hour long each. I enjoyed the moments that Barack spoke about his family and Kenyan heritage, how he visited Kenya and the experience and welcoming he had there. I enjoyed Barack talking about how when he was younger, he never initially applied himself at school despite his potential. It clearly demonstrated great growth in his personality as he moved to eventually becoming engaged with politics and the President. I liked his discussions about his youth in Hawaii and his time in Indonesia with his stepfather. I think Barack touched on a lot of interesting points about his heritage, his upbringing, his racial identity. However, I found nothing really stuck with me. I will 100% read more of Barack's work and I know he's working on a book to follow his presidency. I think perhaps I felt no or little connection with this Barack of 1995, compared to the Barack we see in the media today. I will say his thoughts were well articulated and insightful. I think Barack is a very self-assured writer and I like that confidence and ease with which he talks. I loved that the ending was a full speech from one of his campaign trails as he spoke about what it means to be American, how your racial identity does not matter because you are all American. He spoke about a collective identity and a collective history and it was such a powerful statement to end on. I will always admire Barack Obama and all the great work he does, and everything he stands for. However, I think for me, this book just wasn't the one.

On the black governor of Chicago, Harold Washington, Obama wrote:\"beneath the radiance of Harold's victory . . . nothing seemed to change. I wondered whether, away from the spotlight, Harold thought about those constraints. Whether, like Mr. Anderson or Mrs. Reece or any number of other black officials who now administered over inner city life, he felt as trapped as those he served, an inheritor of sad history, part of a closed system with few moving parts, a system that was losing heat ever day, dropping into low-level stasis. I wondered whether he, too, felt a prisoner of fate.\" (231)I wonder if Obama feels this way as President? Especially given current economic conditions . . . I hope his mandate frees him somewhat, in spite of the legislative grumblings of Republicans.This book examines some of the problems surrounding masculinity, race, and power. Being me, I was of course fascinated by the women surrounding this central mythic tale (Obama's mother, his sister Auma, his Granny who defends polygamy). Obama is attentive to and evocative of their complexity. I love how self-consciously literary this autobiography is. Obama turns his grandfather into a kind of Thomas Sutpen figure.

One does not expect a politician to be so talented at writing (especially these days); a novel is an entirely different affair from a speech or a tweet, after all. The way he ties race relations from his childhood in Hawaii to the systemic sociopolitical problems in Chicago to the fate of Africans under colonial rule is a testament to his skill as a writer. The whole books ties together beautifully and has a powerful, if understated (maybe even softpedaled?) message: that the long history of unjust relations between different races has undermined the opportunity for happiness and wholeness in people around the world. And that anger and blame will not serve to overcome this unfairness; rather, genuine care for a shared sense of heritage and community is the way forward. I was also impressed by the passion that was on display here, especially with respect to Obama's discovery of faith and his heritage. I became politically conscious after Obama was elected to office, so I came to know him as a carefully intellectual and well reasoned president. These characteristics are evident in his earlier years, but his optimism and passion aren't as constrained by the decorum of office. Here you get to sense some of the moments that shaped his development and his concerns.This book gave me a better impression of who my president was. Was it 100% truthful and un-embellished - probably not.

I read reviews of his books, looked at his voting record in the Senate and listened carefully to his speeches. Gradually, I began to feel that this man was something special. Now, perhaps too late, I have read his memoir. The title is a bit confusing: what Obama got from his father he got in one meeting when he was ten years old. The man was a bit of a mystical figure for most of Obama\u2019s life and much of the book is concerned with his eventual trip to Kenya to find out what his father was all about. Comparisons with the current occupant of the White House are inevitable and perhaps unkind to the oaf sitting in the Oval Office, but a reader of Obama\u2019s memoir cannot help comparing the two and reaching the early and firm conclusion that Trump could never be this introspective, this candid, this open to questioning his purpose and his very identity. Obama\u2019s life, times and personal situation\u2014being the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman from Kansas\u2014is so totally opposite the privileged, spoiled and narcissistic rearing of Trump that comparisons simply stop making sense early on. The book is brutally realistic yet often verges on the mystical. Obama\u2019s passages about the \u201cnightrunners\u201d of Kenya are frightening, especially since it appears that many people believe in them. They are mystical, shape-shifting agents of karma who strike in the middle of the night and take people and things away to an uncertain fate. Obama admits he feels grateful that the nightrunners never found him. His background is extremely confusing. He had a father, Barack, who left his mother to found another family altogether with another white woman named Ruth while having an indeterminate number of wives in Kenya. A smart man, he was also troubled and drank a lot. His mother, Ann, married another Kenyan, Lolo, and there were various grandparents and in-laws and relations both American and Kenyan who raised him. A major part of his background happened in Chicago in his first community organizer job. He met many memorable people, learned some humility, but also how to get things and how to fail and recover. What is interesting about the book, among many things, is the fact that he does not mention the fact that he lived with and proposed marriage to an academic, Sheila Miyoshi Jager, while working as a community organizer. She went on to great academic success in the field of anthropology. We do learn that he minimizes his basketball skills though he continues to enjoy the occasional pickup game and is clearly a sports fan. Very little of the later political Obama appears here; the quest is not for votes but for his place in the world. There are few books better at expressing the frustration, doubt, difficulty and haunting nature of being non-white in the American culture as passage after passage ripples with the attempts to find out where he belongs and how he adjusts to being in various roles. Among the most effective passages is one in which he goes out into the street in Chicago to confront a group of teen-age boys who are creating a nuisance. Obama shoos them away but later admits that he felt fear at being in his shorts among them at night. And they were all black. The book ends with his wedding to Michelle. He celebrates with one of his brothers, Abongo (nee Roy) who become a Muslim, reformed his life, and is planning a trip back to Kenya. It is vaguely in Obama\u2019s mind as well though he is destined for greater things. Though he is out of office now and on the periphery of politics, he remains a pivotal figure in American history and, with the deadly seriousness of Trump\u2019s continual attacks on his person and his record, sure to be a pivotal figure for some time to come. As frustrating as his life has been, he has made of it something to be proud and something of great importance to millions of people around the world. I admit my admiration for him. He remains the most accessible president I have met and talked with and for that, alone, he will remain notable to me. The book is about him but much more. It may be more important than ever to have white Americans understand, or at least attempt to understand, the challenges and opposition that black Americans have suffered. That so many ignorant Americans continue to attack him without knowing anything about his life is only another indication that ignorance rules much of his career.

Belonging was often a far-fetched pipe dream for Barack, and from Hawaii to Indonesia to Hawaii again he seemed to understand that his only crutch was his solidarity. His individuality fostered in him a certain inquisitiveness, and by his late teenage years he was enduring the formative struggles of a black man in America. At Occidental College, Barack shares with us his insecurities regarding whether his consciousness was as established as it ought to be. He was surrounded by varying types of African-Americans: some wanted to be viewed as an individual and refused to be defined by their heritage, while others wholly embraced their inheritance to bolster an organic sense of self-assuredness. Barack mainly aligned with the latter school of thought, yet he certainly empathized with the students who wanted to be agents of their own success or failure rather than a part of some wider movement that was beyond their control. Taking this uncertainty into his role as a community organizer, it was evident that our author sought answers to existential questions that would form a foundation for his worldly values.\u200bIn Chicago, Barack experienced a phenomenon that had long eluded him: a sense of community. A lot of folks he organized with were riddled with uncertainty and financial strife, sure, but they empowered one another and attempted to take initiative where it was possible. They were working for the interests of one another, for the interests of the community\u2019s youth, and that purity of intent propelled Barack through a three-year stint often hampered by its lack of structure. In this unusual career move, we begin to understand Barack\u2019s deeper ulterior motive: empowering disenfranchised communities to assemble around common interests. The lessons he learned on the forefront of local struggles for improved housing and education heavily influenced his approach to the study of the law and his time spent as a legislator, although he opts to exclude these experiences in favor of a more appropriate climax to the story. Barack ends his memoir with a long-awaited trip to Kenya, where he reconnects with distant family for the first time and experiences the richest emotional evolution he\u2019d experienced to that point.\u200bAs Barack traverses Kenya he also traverses his family\u2019s history, and he learns that the complicated effects of tribalism still riddle the surrounding society. Recurrently, the issues plaguing members of his family and the wider society mirror the complications his father was facing when he opted to study abroad. Barack Obama Sr. had to struggle between the traditional objective of honoring his family\u2019s history and the independent goal of realizing his potential in a world that increasingly incentivizes self-interest. This survivor\u2019s guilt resembled Barack\u2019s present dilemma, his decision to leave community organizing for a stint at Harvard Law School.\u200bOur author\u2019s answer to his internal struggle for identity embodies the grey area between his father\u2019s two options. It\u2019s necessary to control one\u2019s progression to the extent that he or she can, but it\u2019s impossible to deny any turmoil occurring within one\u2019s former community. Barack Obama Jr. seems to have learned from his father that there is no such thing as a \u201cformer community\u201d; it will forever be inseparably a part of your experience and should thus be embraced and cared for fervently. For a public servant, an attempt to forget one\u2019s former connections is to erase the strongest attribute you possess. A knowledge of one community translates to an empathetic understanding of the ongoing tribulations plaguing a similar community. From there, service becomes less of a chore and more of a natural compulsion to honor one\u2019s family, which has now expanded from thousands of people to millions. Barack would certainly go on to honor this call.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4429880422", "review_id": "4429880422", "date": "Jan 01, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Philip", "user_url": "/user/show/1391890-philip", "text": "Dreams From My Father is Barack Obama\u2019s early autobiography, written before he went to law school. It details his early years and basically presents his pre-lawyer years in three phases, each of which he clearly considered formative, in its own different way.The book is arranged chronologically, so we start with a birth and infancy. We learn something about his parents, his mother from up close but always from afar in relation to his father. \u2018Old Man\u2019 Obama, as we soon learned to call him, was clearly something of a character. We know details of President Obama\u2019s life, so this review will not list unnecessary detail. From Hawaii to Indonesia and eventually to the United States we follow this young life, qt every page turn more mystified at how such a disparate set of experiences could have eventually formed such a rounded individual.One thing the book does not stress which this review cannot overlook, is the use of the term \u2018Old Man\u2019 to label his father. Obama the elder was originally from Kenya and had studied for a doctorate in US colleges. He hailed from western Kenya, a Luo from the Lake Victoria region, where he had received an education that would still have been sympathetic to British traditions and cultures. He was still an African, however, and though not his own language, he would have learned Swahili and would have been fluent in the language. Mzee in Swahili means old man, but it signifies much more than age. It\u2019s a label that would attach to anyone of status or deemed worthy of respect. It was the nickname, for instance, of President Jomo Kenyatta. Indeed, it was his title to such an extent that the use of Mzee with a capital letter would signify the president, himself, to anyone in the country. It is a title that in Kenya would carry no negative connotations whatsoever.Reading Dreams From My Father I found myself regularly confronted with the title Old Man Obama without being reminded of how positive and respectful the label might be. Perhaps this was an oversight, an assumption that the young Barack Obama did not think necessary to restate. On the other hand, it might indicate an ambivalence towards the father who was not only a great man and a higher achiever, but also something of a chancer who could not be described as reliable. Other readers must make their own minds up, but for me personally the continued use of \u2018Old Man\u2019 rather than \u2018mzee\u2019 provided an added layer of complication in this parentage that was already somewhat special. Perhaps the capital letters convey an ultimate respect.Barack Obama Junior, often called Barry, describes much of his early life, especially his years in Indonesia, with affection. The absent father is, however, always absent. What was rather strange was the fact that Barry\u2019s mother is always there, but we hardly get to know her via these pages. If anything, the grandparents figure more in the story, certainly, it seems, in the boy\u2019s personal formation.In the United States, we follow Barry into maturity and, by the time we reach Chicago, he is determined to play an active role in the society where he lives, choosing the route of community organizing to make his mark. It proves to be a hit and miss activity, as it always must be. We who are not generally involved in politics need reminding that it\u2019s an activity where minuscule gains have to be savoured through a general mist of frustration. It\u2019s a quality that clearly makes presidents.Dreams From My Father really comes alive in the third section, when Barry visit Kenya for the first time. Potentially, this is a Roots-like odyssey, but for this particular young man it soon becomes impossible to romanticize about a past that has so many complicated loose ends. Though the family is clearly not poor, the country is, and the young visitor is confronted with many images that confuse or shock. I used to live in Kenya, so it may have been a personal familiarity that brought this section alive. I feel, however, that the young Barack Obama began to understand more about his father during that visit, enough at least to suggest a reality and that reality persuaded him to stay with the dreams.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2669328694", "review_id": "2669328694", "date": "May 21, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Mihaela", "user_url": "/user/show/17767689-mihaela", "text": "I had put this book on my wish list while I was reading Michelle Obama's book, Becoming, last year. I began reading it in the first part of March and found it interesting yet difficult to follow (maybe it was the English used or semantics or I was just not used to his storytelling). And although I was reading a few pages from time to time it was only in May that I just couldn't stop reading it. This is a memoir of Barack Obama. However this is not a book written by a president, as he was far from being a president at the time he wrote it (first published in 1995, he starts his service as President of USA in 2009). So don't expect any juicy details from his time either as senator or as President. This is the story of Barack as a young boy living in Hawaii with his mother and grandparents, meeting his father for the first and only time when he was ten, moving to Indonesia while his mother remarried an Indonesian, returning to Hawaii to live with his grandparents, growing up, going to NY, Chicago, and finally, following the traces of his memory of his father to find the image that he had created of him (from his letters, from his mother's or grandparent's stories, from his newly met sisters and brothers) he goes to Kenya for the first time, meeting a whole rage of intricate family relationships up until he untangles somehow the history of his father. Although is was the most difficult to read I particularly enjoyed the chapters when he worked as an organiser in Chicago, his professional beginnings, his doubts, and struggles to help Afro-American communities in Chicago. The final chapter, the Kenya one was equally special in its own way while Obama literally walks on his father's traces trying to understand himself through the history of this family he has never met. It is both beautiful and heartbreaking. To me it demonstrated how genes are very powerful and how much influence can still have an absent parent on a child (through genes and also imagination of how this parent might have been, and through all the stories heard of him or his letters). Even Obama says in the beginning of the book that had he known his mother would get sick and die so soon, he might have written a different book, maybe less focused on the absent parent and more focused on the parent who was there present and supported him in all his endeavours. This is a story of self-discovery, of race differences, poverty, family, community, little of politics. I cannot say how much has identically happened in real life and it does not matter. Should any of us come to write our memoir, would be really remember the absolute truth about what happened or would be tell the story of what we think happened, some of it in our imagination, some of it in the imagination of others. As I think there is no absolute truth in regards to memories of us growing up. It's how we decided at a certain point to tell our story, and how we look at our story with the today's eyes and maturity. It goes without saying that I truly recommend this book as it made me much richer in knowledge and culture and very reflective of race, inheritance, race. And spoiler alert, Obama could now have been other than an extraordinary person as his father and grandfather were people with out of the ordinary intelligence. And so was his mother and the multicultural environment in which he has a chance to live in (although not wealthy people, they did on).", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1968706043", "review_id": "1968706043", "date": "Apr 26, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "\u1e62af\u0101", "user_url": "/user/show/15999122-af", "text": "Dreams from my father is more of an introspection than an autobiography. I wouldn't call it an autobiography, same as the author, because it's more of a delving into African-American history, the problems their race faces with identity, their roots, their place in the world and their painful history in America and even Africa.Obama takes us along on his journey from his childhood to his growing a young responsible African-American man after he has struggled all his adolescent years trying to solve the puzzle to his identity. Having a white American mother and a Kenyan father absent for most of his life he struggled with his identity, his history, and his surroundings. The book initially starts on a confused note, a gloomy tone but as the book progresses the pain somewhat subsides and is transformed into something positive, something real and concrete. Obama was a confused child, an angry teenager, a lost adult but he transcended his struggles and made them into something that could drive him on in life. After college, he went into organizing for a few years, got accepted into the Harvard Law school, his long-lost father's alma mater, and went on to visit his relatives in Kenya to connect to his roots and find answers before going to grad school.He became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review (though it is not part of the book), incidentally, the impetus for his writing this book.The book, as he himself has said, ends on a happy note, despite the obstacles and the setbacks and I literally see him ride into the sunset with his family.I loved this book, it spoke to my heart, and though all the struggles were not my own I connected with it at a fundamental level. Being a brown person I could understand some of the things Obama was talking about. Reading the struggles I did feel na\u00efve like the author but I could see my struggles reflected in his.I love the cultural references, and the African history and the topography. I loved that Obama went back to the birthland of his father to reconnect, claim his birthright, a piece of his own, his extended family, how he owned up to who he was and his humility in doing everything which connected him to his brothers. It was amazing to see how deeply and sincerely he felt about his roots, his family history, and everything that connected it to him.You see that his struggle, all those hard years was for something, and now, having known that what he has managed to accomplish, you see that his life built him up for greatness without him having asked for it and that how much he deserved it. This is one of the stories of great men and the best part is this book was written at a simpler time when he had just graduated from Harvard presenting a unique unadulterated insight into his life. Though it might not exactly portray it but this book is a symbol of hope for struggling individuals and people coming from humble backgrounds that they can outgrow even themselves. Though he didn't like to admit but the writing was exceptionally good for an amateur and to say for myself, I loved it!This is more of an analysis than a story, I guess you have to read the book to find out. ;)", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2270906716", "review_id": "2270906716", "date": "Mar 13, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Karen N.", "user_url": "/user/show/6831604-karen-n", "text": "This book was so difficult to rate, as I really enjoyed the first two part of the book - about his childhood and growing up and working as a community organizer in Chicago. There was SO much crammed into one book... and the last part about Kenya and meeting his family really wore me out. I didn't find much for the reader about his visit in Kenya, except maybe about the truth he found out about his father and his great grandfather. It felt more as if it was a sacred journey for Barack, having visited his African family for the first time and how everything was revealed to him. But as for the reader, I felt much could have been edited down--especially since there were so many family members and relatives to keep track of. Barack Obama is a remarkable man... and it shows through in his speeches, his character and his political campaign and terms. I am really glad I read this book because it showed more depth of where all those things come from. It also made Barack deeply human, having found out how his grandparents felt about his parents' marriage.. it did come as a disappointment (possibly for both him and the readers). But it was also the truth... the truth about cultures and races and the complexities of it. With Barack having exposure to different cultures and people, and having grown up in both Hawaii and Indonesia, I'd want to say at times, it feels like he is processing the world and see things objectively as if race does not exist (even though he is very aware the issue of race is always there). There is a lot of honesty in the book--and nothing ever feels like it has been glossed over or embellished to make the story seem more interesting or entertaining. In terms of Barack as a writer, the thing I enjoyed most is his colorful and creative language. I didn't mark any to be able to site them right now, but his use of phrase or words in sentences really stood out for me. I was inspired to read this book after watching the Netflix Original \"My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman\". In the interview with Obama, he mentioned about this book and the rigorous lesson plans he had as a kid, where his mother would wake him up couple hours before school started to go over his studies. That is a lot of dedication towards education coming from his mother. In the Preface to the the 2004 edition, it was really sweet how dearly Barack spoke of his mother--and in hindsight, had Barack known that she would not survive the illness while he was writing the book, he would have wrote a different book. Instead of writing a book about an absent father, Barack would have wrote one about a parent who was always there (which would be his mother). There is so much to be said about that, but that's for another book or another review.

And when the common man overcomes these clich\u00e9s, his life becomes story for others to cherish.

Born in Hawaii to a black African father and white Midwestern mother, he grew up feeling an identity crisis between two racial worlds. It is both an extraordinary and inspiring story to follow Obama in his quest to understand his absent father\u2019s past, connect with his siblings and relatives in Kenya, and find his purpose in life as a community organizer and eventual public servant at the highest level. No matter the obstacles he encountered due to race, he remained open-minded, compassionate, and forgiving in his outlook of the world. In his youth when he began to experience the tension between whites having all the power and blacks assuming the right to be angry, he refused to allow hatred and pessimism to pull him into despair. By the end of his high school years, however, this sobering reality of racial division led him towards a feeling of indifference about his purpose in life. His focus over what to do remained conflicted until he entered Occidental College in Los Angeles and started working with divestment campaigns on campus. He began recruiting representatives to speak at university engagements, and during this time he noticed people paid attention to him when he gave opening comments at these events. He took on the mentality of looking at himself in the mirror before ever thinking to pass judgment on others. He believed in addressing his own troubles, rather than letting others do so for him. He adopted the mantra that his purpose in life was not about himself, but about helping others. After he realized this, he could look back and see how fear had caused him to lose his way. With newfound determination, he pressed forward to shape his future and take responsibility for his actions. He challenged himself to be part of a community activism that ran deeper than despair. This commitment to helping others at the grassroots level tested his sacrifice to give back. After several years as a community organizer in Chicago, he was accepted to law school at Harvard. Before setting off to school, he fulfilled his lifelong calling to visit Africa and meet his siblings and his father\u2019s extended family. This journey transformed him as he finally had the opportunity to connect with his roots and resolve his conflicted emotions about his identity.This is a scholarly memoir full of profound ideas and insight, yet it is compulsively readable. Obama shows how he can employ the perspective of a sociologist, the intuition of a philosopher, the diplomacy of a politician, or the eye of a poet in his approach to looking at the world\u2019s problems and seeing solutions. He demonstrates his commitment to reflect upon and gain knowledge of others in order to understand how he can better insert himself in causes that seek to make a difference for people living in impoverished communities. He writes with tremendous humility, sympathy, and foresight, and he shows tolerance and a willingness to understand the deeper meaning of issues in order to locate realistic solutions.Obama\u2019s story is a testament to his humanity and idealism. Even as a visionary, he conveys his grounded understanding to see what\u2019s possible and then put in the grunt work to make change happen. He set out on a journey to address his crisis of identity, and during his travels he found that he belonged within a larger community.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["non-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2965397139", "review_id": "2965397139", "date": "Sep 04, 2019", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Gautham Vasan", "user_url": "/user/show/29446357-gautham-vasan", "text": "We live in a messy, complicated world.

He is a great man who understands that most things in life are nuanced. He talks of a morality of subtle distinctions - between individuals of goodwill and those who wished him ill, between active malice and ignorance or indifference.

I looked up Barack Obama and learned he\u2019d also written a memoir and borrowed it from the library. Why I thought I could read a nonfiction book while I was in grad school, I\u2019ll never know.

Obama does discuss his upbringing in Hawaii and Indonesia, his education in New York City, his first attempts at community organizing in the poor black neighborhoods of Chicago, and his first trip to Kenya to meet his extended family and come to terms with the father he barely knew. Considering later events, it's also interesting to see his first impressions of Reverend Wright and why the man became so important to him.

He spends a lot of time geeking out about how different communities function (or fail to function) in America and Africa, and what it takes to effect even the most incremental change, something that clearly fascinates him. And he spends a very long chapter disgorging the history of his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father in an effort to make sense of the fraught legacy they left behind.While the book does drag in a few places where he goes down certain intellectual tangents, and the ending is a little clumsy as he tries to both tie all the threads together and avoid ending on a downer, it was interesting to get a sense of how his mind works and what forces shaped him.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2542965938", "review_id": "2542965938", "date": "Nov 08, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Rahul", "user_url": "/user/show/21956816-rahul", "text": "This book was published in 1995 when B.O was only a senator.

Reading Obama's book has given me a much better understanding of what black people experience living in non-black countries.There is one fundamental problem for me that shows up in Obama's life experience, and ultimately in his Presidency - his weakness in Business and Economics. He understands that the US is a more affluent country than either Kenya or Indonesia, but he appears to make the assumption that this affluence is the result of tolerance. History shows that tolerance is the result of prosperity, ie Rome or Venice.This is an interesting story because it's written by someone who would become President, but while they were still a very young man. It's written without the hindsight and revision that would come through retelling their life story thousands of times and settling on the \"best version\". Therefore, it's a much different story than Bill Clinton's My Life By Bill Clinton. Read it because it's real, because it's RAW.I particularly enjoyed Obama's comments about charity, which anyone who's lived in emerging markets will understand:So it was to Lolo that I turned for guidance and instruction. He didn\u2019t talk much, but he was easy to be with. With his family and friends he introduced me as his son, but he never pressed things beyond matter-of-fact advice or pretended that our relationship was more than it was. I appreciated this distance; it implied a manly trust. And his knowledge of the world seemed inexhaustible. Not just how to change a flat tire or open in chess. He knew more elusive things, ways of managing the emotions I felt, ways to explain fate\u2019s constant mysteries. Like how to deal with beggars. They seemed to be everywhere, a gallery of ills\u2014men, women, children, in tattered clothing matted with dirt, some without arms, others without feet, victims of scurvy or polio or leprosy walking on their hands or rolling down the crowded sidewalks in jerry-built carts, their legs twisted behind them like contortionists\u2019. At first, I watched my mother give over her money to anyone who stopped at our door or stretched out an arm as we passed on the streets. Later, when it became clear that the tide of pain was endless, she gave more selectively, learning to calibrate the levels of misery. Lolo thought her moral calculations endearing but silly, and whenever he caught me following her example with the few coins in my possession, he would raise his eyebrows and take me aside. \u201cHow much money do you have?\u201d he would ask.I\u2019d empty my pocket. \u201cThirty rupiah.\u201d\u201cHow many beggars are there on the street?\u201dI tried to imagine the number that had come by the house in the last week. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, once it was clear I\u2019d lost count. \u201cBetter to save your money and make sure you don\u2019t end up on the street yourself.\u201d He was the same way about servants. They were mostly young villagers newly arrived in the city, often working for families not much better off than themselves, sending money to their people back in the country or saving enough to start their own businesses. If they had ambition, Lolo was willing to help them get their start, and he would generally tolerate their personal idiosyncrasies: for over a year, he employed a good-natured young man who liked to dress up as a woman on weekends\u2014Lolo loved the man\u2019s cooking. But he would fire the servants without compunction if they were clumsy, forgetful, or otherwise cost him money; and he would be baffled when either my mother or I tried to protect them from his judgment. \u201cYour mother has a soft heart,\u201d Lolo would tell me one day after my mother tried to take the blame for knocking a radio off the dresser. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing in a woman. But you will be a man someday, and a man needs to have more sense.\u201d It had nothing to do with good or bad, he explained, like or dislike. It was a matter of taking life on its own terms.

Regardless, it is clear that many Americans could be better informed. To that end, I\u2019d recommend Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama, as a worth-while read\u2014and it would be even if the guy that wrote it hadn't gone on to become an American President. The book is divided into 3 sections and an epilogue. The first section recounts Obama's childhood in Hawaii and a couple of years spent in Indonesia. It is interesting to see the impression made upon Obama of being an outsider in Indonesia, and as an American abroad it is reassuring to me that his mind is open to the rest of the world. Unfortunate, then, that so many policies disadvantaging Americans abroad persist--but I digress. The second section is about his experiences as a community organizer in Chicago, before going to law school. The stories in this section were especially interesting, and I was impressed by his dedication and faith that his efforts and investments were worthwhile. The third section covers Obama's first visit to Kenya. While I was afraid that this section would idealize Africa too much, it actually did a good job of presenting the cultural conflicts (values of colonialism/Western world vs. tribalism) in a concise way without smoothing over the complexities of the issues. While the book is presented as a search for identity as a black man in America, the themes have much broader application. Who are any of us? Is there really such a thing as a pure cultural identity anymore? Personally, I am an American married to a German. Our daughter was born in Switzerland, where we have just returned after two years in Dubai. She will grow up speaking English and German, and still remembers a little Arabic. Maybe this is a great gift we are giving her--to be comfortable in so many cultures, but it also might have her asking where her home really is. I liked Obama's ultimate approach of taking the good from each of his cultural backgrounds, and leaving behind the bad.

It came across to me as authentic and honest -- not a bit rhetorical (except a little bit at the end). Complex with well thought out observations and insight. It didn't feel like it was thrown together to help sell him as a politician -- though I'm sure he wrote the book with a future of politics in mind. Very easy to read, and interesting -- even for someone who overdosed on media coverage of Obama during the presidential race. There's a lot to learn from this as an historical document. Although I started it knowing quite a bit about Obama, the honesty and depth of Obama's personal reflection, and the style in which it is written make this book a must-read, as many other reviewers have commented. I especially liked the picture provided of Obama's days as a community organizer in Chicago. (I wonder if his critics even bothered to read this book, before they belittled the value of the role he played in the South Side of Chicago. His experience made me respect him even more.) I think it provided a much-needed context for an outsider's understanding of Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Jr. - realizing the success of his church's programs and the role it plays in the community, and bringing together and unifying the more affluent middle class with the struggling poor. Not to romanticize or gloss over Wright's provocative and objectionable rhetoric that we've witnessed in prime-time media sound bytes. But to broaden the lens just a bit.I also learned a lot from Obama's travelogue of his first trip to Kenya, before he headed off to Harvard Law School. I came away with a better appreciation for the history and conditions that produced his grandfather and father. Obama grapples with realizations about the strengths and weaknesses of his ancestors and his extended family, and the complex set of circumstances they faced, in regards to the politics of Kenya and the emerging dominance of white men in Africa. I enjoyed the opportunity to meet all of his half-sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, and other relations -- quite an interesting assortment of characters, struggling in their various ways to make their way.It goes without saying that Barack Obama faces a formidable set of challenges as the president, and I don't find myself agreeing with everything he says or does.

How he appeared so self-centered? Why almost all part 1 revolved obsessively around the question of his race?

I also hate that each chapter doesn't come a title, so sometimes I'd need to check his timelines in wiki for sake of clarity. With all above reasons, I considered giving it up half way.I luckily did not. The most worth-reading part, which miraculously saved this review was the last five chapters, when he recounted his first three-week trip to Kenya. Though the pattern of writing still emerged here - so many long sentences, sometimes forced and far-stretched figurative thoughts with redundant pieces of conversations - the content was intriguing enough for me to get hooked. He told this story well, and intimately (you can even find some quite private conversations here) as if he was speaking with a friendly tentative companion in a calm breezy night. It was a nice surprise that somehow I managed to resonate with his confusing definition of home and family. The exchanges he described in his reunion with far flung extended family nicely give me some reasons to say \"yes, I know how that feels like\".

He tells his personal history as well as the history of American\u2019s race relations and understanding through the eyes of a biracial boy-turned man, coming of age in the late 20th Century.

It\u2019s still remarkable to comprehend that this narrator, given his roots, eventually becomes the elected 44th President of the United States.I enjoyed listening to the narration of this story by the author.

He wrote it in 1995, and got it published because of his being Editor of the \"Harvard Law Review.\" He wrote it before he was a politician. Perhaps for that reason it is so brutally honest. It is a Socratic discourse on his quest of self discovery. It reveals who he is, and why and how he became the man he is. Any questions you may have about him are answered here, especially his belief in change through working together, versus the use of force. The roots of his foreign and domestic policy beliefs, and methods, are here.A must read. And so I reread it just now and lo ... you should, too. Here's my re-review after he's been president for 7+ years.[The following is excerpted from Barack Obama\u2019s memoir, Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance. It\u2019s why I supported, endorsed, and voted for Obama, twice. The man can write! and tells a good story. Prophetic, in fact. Double quotes are Obama\u2019s text, triple quotes where he quotes himself, and single quotes the voice of another person. I pick up the story mid-way, the chapter titled \u201cChicago. It\u2019s 1983.\u201d]\u201cI\u2019d pronounce the need for change. Change in the White House, where Reagan and his minions were carrying on their dirty deeds. Change in the Congress, compliant and corrupt. Change in the mood of the country, manic and self-absorbed. Change won\u2019t come from the top, I would say. Changer will come from a mobilized grass roots.\u201cCommunities had to be created, fought for, tended like gardens. They expanded or contracted with the dreams of me\u2014and in the civil rights movement those dreams had been large. I saw the African-American community becoming more than just the place where you\u2019d been born or the house where you\u2019d been raised. Through organizing, through shared sacrifice, membership had been earned\u2014because this community I imagined was still in the making, built on the promise that the larger American community, black, white, and brown, could somehow redefine itself\u2014I believed it might, over time, admit the uniqueness of mu own life.\u201cThat was my idea of organizing. It was the promise of redemption.\u2018to get the job done, we\u2019ve got to forge links between business, government and the inner city.\u2018Why does somebody from Hawaii want to be an organizer? You must be angry about something. \u2026 anger\u2019s a requirement for the job. Well- adjusted people find more relaxing work.\u2018You a Muslim?\u2018\u2026 stop fighting each other and start going after the real enemy. The investment bankers. The politicians. The fat cat lobbyists.\u2019\u201c\u2026 if you could just clear away the politicians and media and bureaucrats and give everybody a seat at the table, then ordinary people could find common ground. \u201cIn Indonesia, I had spent two years at a Muslim school, two years at a Catholic school.\u201d\u2018The last thing we need is to join up with a bunch of white money and Catholic churches and Jewish organizers to solve our problems \u2026 the archdiocese in this city is run by stone-cold racists. Always has been. White folks come in here thinking they know what\u2019s best for us, hiring a buncha high-talking college-educated brothers like your self who don\u2019t know no better, and all they want to do is take over. It\u2019s all a political thing \u2026\u2019\u201cIn politics, like religion, power lay in certainty\u2014and that one man\u2019s certainty always threatened another\u2019s.\u201cNow that the jobs were gone, it seemed only natural to use the land as a dump.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s what ruins a lot of so-called community organizations out here. They start taking government money. They hire big, do-nothing staffs. Pretty soon, they\u2019ve become big patronage operations, with clients to be serviced. Not leaders. Clients. To be serviced. Jesus, it makes you sick just thinking about it.\u2019\u201cThe past was the present.\u201d\u2018We can\u2019t keep on making promises to our people, and have nothing happen. We need something now.\u2019\u201c\u2018You know, I didn\u2019t come here \u2018cause I needed a job. If there\u2019s a problem, then well fix it.\u2019\u201d\u2018\u2026 we got problems. That\u2019s why he hired Barack ain\u2019t that right Barack?\u2019\u201cI nodded cautiously.\u201d\u2018Seems like you know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u2018\u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have a clue.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd I knew that the father was absent.\u201d\u2018When I think back on my own childhood, I remember some really good times. Seemed like I was smiling all the time, laughing\u2014I don\u2019t see kids smiling around here no more \u2026 they seem worried all the time, mad about something. They got nothing they trust. Not their parents. Not god. Not themselves. And that\u2019s not right. That\u2019s just ain\u2019t the way things supposed to be \u2026kids not smiling.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s the real deal, right here. People from outside our community making money off us and showing our brothers and sisters disrespect. Basically what you got here is Koreans and Arabs running the stores, the Jews still owning most of the buildings.\u2019\u2018Wally/Rafiq [not their real names. Obama changed names and made composites of persons, and reconstructed dialogue. He was 33 when he wrote this. The above recollections are when he was 24 and first went to Chicago, after graduation from Columbia.] was a big-time gang-banger before he became a Muslim. Once a thug, always a thug.\u2019\u2018\u201cHey, didn\u2019t I promise we were gonna make something happen.\u2019 I can do this job, I said to myself. Have the whole damn town organized by the time we\u2019re through. Then, under a streetlight a few feet away, I saw the drunk from the meeting spinning around in slow circles, looking down at his elongated shadow. I got out of my car and asked him if he needed some help getting home.\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t need no help! Not from nobody, you understand me! Punk-ass motherfucker \u2026 try to tell me shit \u2026\u2019\u201cHe turned and began to wobble down the center of the road, disappearing into the darkness.\u201d[It\u2019s time to make my point \u2013 that the something that is going on is that Barack Obama has failed, again, to solve the problems. In fact, not only has he failed to improve the lives of African Americans, but now the white middle class, many of them is, comparatively, slipping into poverty, being left behind. He sees in Donald Trump the white man fat cat pointing a finger in his face, reminding him of his failure. The big white man coming to the rescue, just like it\u2019s always been. Read on.]\u2018What are you surprised about? That black people still hate themselves?\u2019\u201c\u2026 black pride remained incomplete. And to admit our doubt and confusion to whites, to open up our psyches to general examination by those who had caused so much of the damage in the first place, seemed ludicrous, itself an expression of self-hatred\u2014for there seemed no reason to expect that whites would look at our private struggles as a mirror into their own souls, rather than yet more evidence of black pathology. A black leader casually explained to me that he never dealt with black contractors, \u2018A black man\u2019ll just mess it up, and I\u2019ll end up paying white folks to do it all over again.\u2019 Or in another leader\u2019s rationale, \u2018Black folks are just lazy, Barack\u2014don\u2019t wanna do nothing.\u2019 [So here it is, in his own words. Obama is scared to death that it\u2019s all true, what was reality then, in the mid-eighties, is still reality. He couldn\u2019t fix it then, and he couldn\u2019t fix it now, not even as the president. And here comes Trump, telling him he failed and that Trump, the white man, can fix it. There\u2019s more. Read on.]\u201cThe stories had arisen out of a very particular experience with hate \u2026 at the center of which stood white people\u2014some cruel, some ignorant, sometimes a single face, sometimes just a faceless image of a system claiming power over our lives. I had to ask myself whether the bonds of community could be restored without collectively exorcising that ghostly figure that haunted black dreams. Could ___ love herself without hating blue eyes?\u2019 [The ghostly figure now has a face, Trump\u2019s; and Obama\u2019s hatred has come pouring out, self-hatred for failing transferred onto Trump. It\u2019s classic. The story of Rafig, his partner and mentor, is telling.]\u201cRafiq and I could sometimes have normal conversations. \u2026 he had found religion under the stewardship of a local Muslim leader, \u2018If it hadn\u2019t been for Islam, man, I\u2019d probably be dead. I\u2019d soaked up all the poison the white man feeds us. They [black folks] know what this country has done to their momma, their daddy, their sister. So the truth is they hate white folks, but they can\u2019t admit to themselves. Keep it all bottled up, fighting themselves. It\u2019s about blood, Barack, looking after your own. Period. Black people the only ones stupid enough to worry about their enemies.\u2019\u201c \u2026 as Rafiq saw it, distrust was a given and loyalties extended from family to mosque to the black race\u2014whereupon notions of loyalties ceased to apply. \u2026 black self-respect turned around the lives of drug addicts under the tutelage of Muslims. I had tried to untangle the twin strands of black nationalism, arguing that nationalism\u2019s affirming message\u2014of solidarity and self-reliance, discipline and communal responsibility\u2014need not depend on hatred of whites any more than it depended on white munificence. \u2026 I came to see how the blanket indictment of everything white served a central function \u2026; how, psychologically, one depended on the other. [It\u2019s chilling, eerie\u2014all of Obama\u2019s worst fears have been realized\u2014he\u2019s not only failed, but been proven wrong.] Rafiq was right when he insisted that, deep down, all blacks were potential nationalists. [black nationalists; but what if Trump could actually turn them into American nationalists?]the anger was there, bottled up and often turned inward. I wondered whether, Rafiq wasn\u2019t also right in preferring that that anger be redirected \u2026 [Anger is a powerful force, it\u2019s energizing. It\u2019s target had better be wary. If unified, it can accomplish tremendous things. I wonder whether this isn\u2019t what really is going on with Obama \u2013 that he fears Trump can channel the people\u2019s anger towards good, whereas he, Obama, couldn\u2019t. That would be devastating.] If nationalism could create a strong and effective insularity, deliver on its promise of self-respect, then the hurt it might cause ___, or the inner turmoil it caused people like me, would be of little consequence. His [Rafiq] influence arose not from any strong organizational support but from his willingness to show up at every meeting \u2026 and shout his opponents into submission.\u201d\u2026[Time passes and the disappoints mount for the young Mr. Obama. He meets his half sister and brother, after his father\u2019s death. They tell him their stories. It\u2019s late in 1987, Barack is 26.]\u201cThe world in which I spent those difficult times [high school in Hawaii, late 70\u2019s] was far more forgiving \u2026that truth forces others to shut off access to any empathy they may once have felt. \u2026 an order of some sort is required \u2026 . we are breaking apart \u2026 into different tribes, speaking different tongue, living by a different code. \u2026 I\u2019ve been both stupid and lucky, knowing that I am afraid after all.\u201d [and then Mr. Obama meets the Reverend Dr. Jeremiah Wright, Jr.]\u2018By the way, what church do you belong to?\u2019\u2018\u201cStill searching, I guess.\u201d\u2019\u201cmaybe once you stripped away the rationalizations, it always came down to a simple matter of escape. \u2026 the closest thing to freedom would still involve escape, emotional if not physical, away from ourselves, away from what we knew, flight into the outer reaches of the white man\u2019s power\u2014or closer into its bosom. Was that all that had brought me to Chicago\u2014the desire for simple acceptance? But to be right with yourself, to do right by others, to lend meaning to a community\u2019s sufferings and take part in its healing\u2014that required something more. It required faith. Where did your faith come from? He had asked. I didn\u2019t have an answer. [But the Reverend Wright did \u2013 in his sermon: The Audacity of Hope. And Barack wept. It was early 1988, before leaving for Harvard; but first Kenya.]s\u2026\u201cI had been forced to look inside myself and had found only a great emptiness there. It was nice to believe that the truth would somehow set me free. But what if that was wrong? What if the truth only disappointed \u2026 ?[Barack Husseen Obama, Jr. meets his family, all of them, and his grandmother tells him the history of who he is. He is of the Tribe Ja\u2019 Luo, and the lineage is known back as far as twelve generations. They were pastoralists, wandering goat herders and warriors, until settling down on the banks of Lake Victroia, where the beginnings of mankind are thought to have occurred, taking up fishing and farming. His father, a disagreeable genius, had four wives, two of whom were white, and seven children. He died a broken, vain man. The clan now/then was fractured within, some educated, some not. Some still lived without electricity or running water. Many of the men were unemployed and close to alcoholic. There was bitterness, resentfulness \u2026 shattered hopes and dreams. Even the women were quarrelsome. Barry, as he was called, was thought very highly of and returned to America disillusioned yet determined. And as it is said \u2013 the rest is history. The edition of the book I have is a newer addition with a 2005 preface and an excerpt from The Audacity Of Hope: Thoughts On Reclaiming The American Dream, which, both are, stunning in what the reveal\u2014the why of President Obama\u2019s hatred for Donald Trump. They simply tell of the largeness of his failure to do what he set out to do, what he intended to do. He thought he could bring people together, that he could transcend what was into something that should be\u2014people of all races and tribes and religions and countries working together in cooperation to alleviate poverty and hatred and war. It\u2019s eerie. In 2006, before his candidacy for president, he writes:\u201cAcross the spectrum of issues, Americans disagreed: on Iraq, taxes, abortion, guns, the Ten Commandments, gay marriage, immigration, trade, education policy, environmental regulation, the size of government, and the role of the courts. Not only did we disagree, but we disagreed vehemently, with partisans on each side of the divide unrestrained in the vitriol they hurled at opponents. Everything was contestable, whether it was the cause of climate change or the fact of climate change, the size of the deficit or the culprits to blame for the deficit. \u2026 If I could reach those voters directly, frame the issues as I felt them, explain the choices in as truthful a fashion as I knew how, then the people\u2019s instincts for fair play and common sense would bring them around.\u201d[Clearly, as Trump suggests and stated; \u201cHe doesn't get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands. It's one or the other, and either one is unacceptable.\" So Trump has called out Obama, and nailed him. What he understands is that he understood what needed to be done, and failed, and knows it. Now, consider this: If Hillary Clinton is elected, and fails to solve these issues, which she will most likely, that validates Obama\u2019s failure \u2013 he wins by her losing. Schaenfreude. (see above in \u201cThe Case Against Trump. June 12.) But, if Trump should win, and succeed, because Trump is right and Obama was wrong, wrong all along, about most everything, about \u201cthe voters\u201d and people in general, across the globe, that \u201cTribalism\u201d just is who we are and needs to be recognized and celebrated, not demonized; and that his wife was right\u2014that he is just a dreamer. What if everything you thought was right was wrong?Mr. Obama, Barry, maybe you should never have thrown the Reverend Dr. Jeremiah Wright Jr. under the bus.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["biography-memoir", "nonfiction", "relationships", "trump"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/35499699", "review_id": "35499699", "date": "Oct 16, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Misha", "user_url": "/user/show/175912-misha", "text": "Obama can really write!

Nygma", "user_url": "/user/show/5966687-e-nygma", "text": "With a very important U.S. Presidential election on the horizon, I decided to read this book to give me some insight on a man of which I really had no opinion four years ago when he was elected to the Office of The President of the United States of America. Shame on me for not taking the time to learn as much as I could about him then. I will not make that mistake twice! It is a privilege to vote for the leader of the most powerful country in the world and those who have earned that right (either through reaching the legal age or through acquiring legal U.S. Citizenship) should never make excuses to not spend some time learning as much as possible about both candidates, not just blindly following the one they \"think\" feels the same way they do about issues. I personally know many voters of all ages who derive their entire political belief system based on bumper stickers, slogans and by surrounding themselves with people who believe the same as they do, which is at the very least, irresponsible.Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance is fairly well-written (though a sometimes the author would seem to drift off in to explaining in minute detail of something fairly insignificant or replaying a long conversation word-for-word which became a bit tedious for me). The story he is telling is an interesting story and it is easy to feel the emotions he is trying to convey.I do need to point out that this book was originally published in 1995 and that was the version I read. It has been noted that the updated 2004 version has some key differences and I will point those differences out in this review. They are important because they are very telling when trying to understand why the author does what he does when dealing with conflict. A note to those planning on reading this book: the 1995 version is the original version with the bio stating that the author, Barack H. Obama, being born in Kenya and has some shocking observations by the author. The 2004 version has removed those statements and parts of the book and made the story more \"politically correct\". So take care in choosing the edition, there is a difference.The story is an autobiography about an (at the time) unknown man who was born to an interracial couple in 1960. His father was an African national, from a village in Kenya, his mother a career college student from the midwestern U.S. Autobiographies are very useful means to learn from the author's experiences. Autobiographies by authors that were highly successful in their lives, or had a major impact on history, can provide information revealing as many of the valuable lessons the author has learned and recorded for the benefit of the reader. Autobiographies also reveal how authors think and this was the part of the book that took it from a story about a boy growing up in the 60's who is struggling with himself on how to \"fit in\" as a biracial person to a fervent advocate for the real and perceived injustices suffered by blacks in that era.The author interprets every experience and thing he knows of in terms of liberal sociological and psychological teachings. It comes through, often seemingly illogically, in his interpretation of every experience and thing he acquires knowledge of on almost every page of the book.At the end of his Columbia University days, he decided to become a community organizer (or social activist). The author had previously transferred from Occidental College (Oxy) to Columbia University in New York city since most blacks at Oxy wanted to get along with and be successful in the mainstream and were not interested in social activism. He viewed Columbia as being \"in heart of a true city, with black neighborhoods in close proximity.\" Oxy is located near Pasadena, a highly enviable and pristine town near Los Angeles, noted for its prosperity and resistance to crack-pot ideas and politics (from what this reviewer knows of that town). The author describes the Oxy environment as being similar to Hawaii, \"The students were friendly, the teachers encouraging,\" and the author labels any such behaving blacks as \"compromise.\"While at Oxy, he preferred to associate with: \"The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets. We smoked cigarettes and wore leather jackets. At night, in the dorms, we discussed neocolonialism, Franz Fanon, Eurocentrism, and patriarchy. When we ground out our cigarettes in the hallway carpet or set our stereos so loud that the walls began to shake, we were resisting bourgeois society's stifling constraints. We weren't indifferent or careless or insecure. We were alienated.\" And the author appeared to be diligent about being as alien and uncivil in society as he could be with this group of clones of his maternal grandfather.The harsh and bleak realities of portions of New York City that he stayed in and visited while at Columbia compel the author to cease using drugs and practicing other related dissipations that he indulged in while at Oxy. In other words, he fits very comfortably into the harsh and bleak areas of the NYC environment, but could not tolerate the relatively plush, prosperous, and pristine Pasadena environment.The author has little else to say about his Junior and Senior years at Columbia. The highlight of his stay at Columbia is a visit from his mother and his sister, to check up on him and to show her daughter all the sights to see in the city as well as other locations in the continental US.After college, he became a research assistant in a consulting house to multinational corporations -- with the intent of staying only long enough to pay off his college expenses. He described himself as \"spy behind enemy lines,\" still in the mind-set of an hostile alien. He was the envy of the other black employees at that firm and they were proud of him but disparaged of his plans to become a community organizer. After he was promoted to financial writer, he left the company (and it leaves him in excellent financial condition) to pursue his community organizer interests. His initial community organizer work proves to be unprofitable (and leaves him in poor financial condition).Then he interviewed with a Chicago based community organizer (highlighting that he looked very out-of-shape and unkempt, and was Jewish). The community organizer asked him, \"Hmmph.\"...\"You must be angry about something.\" The author replied: \"What do you mean by that?\" The community organizer answered: \"I don't know what exactly. But something. Don't get me wrong -- anger's a requirement for the job. The only reason anybody decides to become an organizer. Well adjusted people find more relaxing work.\" So this preferred career choice showed that the author had developed a large measure of anger about race.(For those who might not know, a community organizer is a person who basically goes into a community of lower income people and points out problems that they should be angry about and incites them to do something about it. At the same time, he lamented that Africans didn't know they were poor until \"whites\" arrived and showed them all of the things they were missing out on.)His dad (Barack Obama, Sr.) was from Kenya. His dad was resourceful and intelligent enough to get a scholarship to attend college in Hawaii. That is where he met Obama Jr.'s white mother (Ann Dunham). He digressed to describe her parents (Stanley (family familiar: \"Gramps\") and Madelyn (family familiar: \"Toot\") Dunham) and their backgrounds. It is his white grandparents who perform a major portion of the author's upbringing (the cover photographs show that author bears a striking resemblance to his white maternal grandfather - the text makes no mention of this). His white grandfather always preferred the company of blacks as he was something of a wild rebel and simply did not fit into main (white) society. This likely influenced his daughter's decision to marry Barack Obama Sr.. His daughter's marriage only lasted a short while. Barack Obama Sr. Received a scholarship to do graduate work at Harvard, so he left the his son at about age two and his mother in Hawaii with the grandparents and went to Harvard. He turned downed a more generous financial offer from another university in New York city that would have allowed the entire family to go there but he preferred the prestige of Harvard - despite its less generous financial offer. So he went to Harvard by himself.Meanwhile, Stanley Dunham received a long and harsh letter from Obama Sr.'s severe father (Hussein Onyango) denouncing the marriage and it became apparent to her from the other contents of the letter that Barack Obama Sr. was still legally (or by local tradition) married to his first Kenyan wife and so she divorced him since she did not approve of polygamy. Before the marriage, Barack Obama Sr. had told Ann Dunham that he had separated from his first Kenyan wife that he had been married in a traditional village marriage. The narrative later explains that polygamy is a Kenyan tradition (ditto the rest of sub Saharan Africa) and when a Kenyan marriage ends, the children go to the father, if he wants them. African traditions are like laws and are treated as having more authority than civil laws (the book does not discuss this matter but you cannot miss it if you know any Africans or have visited the continent). Hussein Onyango was vehemently opposed to that marriage since he had become very familiar with western culture (he had immersed himself in it when the British showed up in order to learn their ways and to learn how to defeat them) and knew that no white woman would put up with a polygamous African husband. His long and harsh letter to Stanley Dunham effectively torpedoed his daughter's marriage to Barack Obama Sr. once she had read it.After Harvard, Barack Obama Sr. went back to Kenya with his next American white wife (Ruth, 2 children) while still married to the first Kenyan wife (2 children). He worked for the local Shell oil division and then used his connections to get a government job in the Ministry of Tourism. It lasted until his well known imperious manner got him into trouble with Jomo Kenyatta himself. He had to scrape by on handouts until Kenyatta died and then he got another government job in the Ministry of Finance. Meanwhile, he routinely became drunk so that his third wife Ruth left him after his first DUI car accident that killed the other driver (a white farmer). The author only saw him for a few days while he was living in Hawaii (when his dad came to stay to recover from his first major auto wreck). He then had a young fourth wife (1 child). Later his dad got killed in his final auto wreck.This missing dad later motivates the author to search out information about him since he was never really raised by him at all and only sent him a number of short general type letters. His dad was spread too thin from one continent to another, one wife and the children by her (not \"her children\" according to Kenyan tradition), and with other wives and the children by them. Therefore, he ended up not being an effective real-time dad to any of the children he fathered. Only one of the author's male Kenyan relatives realizes that polygamy simply does not work. The author was somewhat shattered by what he found out from his relatives in Kenya about his father.The author's mother married an Indonesian student (Lolo) after divorcing Barack Obama, Sr. and moved to Indonesia with the author. His step-father fathered his half-sister Maya. The author's step-father took a genuine interest in his development and upbringing, teaching him how to survive and cope in a hazardous, corrupt, and wretched society. This training appears to be the basis of the author's unrivalled political skills. This marriage lasts until the author's mother decided that this husband was too cooperative with that country's corrupting practices to get by (her impractical idealism clashed badly with his practical reality methods) and did not like how the author was being treated in the local schools (since Asians are intolerant of racial differences). The author's step-father tried hard to provide for and shelter his family -- at a level far above the norm for Indonesian society, but the author's mother resented it all since none of this conformed to her ideals of absolute ideological perfection. One can afford to have these ideas, courtesy of a rule-of-law society, such as in the US, whether these impractical ideas work or not, anywhere at all -- but not in a social Darwinist type society, such as Indonesia, where no one can survive on the ideals of absolute ideological perfection. So in the end, ideological incorrectness ended the marriage. The author labels his step father as a compromiser, despite all the survival skills he taught him that he very effectively uses for politics.On the other hand, the author's mother was, to some degree, justified to object to the corrupt practices present in Indonesian society since that is what make a third world country a third world country. This reviewer has encountered a number of people from the third world who were raised on social Darwinist principles. They always look only after themselves, they will take advantage of you every time you have to work with them, they take credit for your work, they hide information you need - even if you have requested it, they walk all over you, they make you appear to be useless, and in the end - they cause you to be booted out.Obama's mother then took her children back to Hawaii (when he was about 10 years old) to have their grandparents raise them while she was working on yet another degree and then divorced Lolo. That's right, her work as a perpetual student was more important than than raising her children. Sound familiar? The Dunhams seem to have been already immersed in the lower end of the self-serving, self-righteous, and all about-me social behavior.Back in Hawaii, his maternal grandfather's boss used his alumni connections to get the author admitted to Punahou, an expensive private secondary school in Hawaii. Obama completed grades 5 to 12 at Punahou. A notable incident there was a white high-school friend's discomfort at an all-black party that made the author feel as if he was regarded as societal alien by all whites and this angered him very intensely. This incident appears to stir up his festering anger about race.Later, his grandmother insists on being driven to work on a day following an incident where a black man had harassed her at the bus stop. This incident cements his anger about race.The book even explains how he developed his renown smooth-saying abilities (from pages 94-95 of the 1995 Three Rivers Press and Crown Publishers paperback versions):\"...and one day she\" (referring to his mother) \"had marched into my room, wanting to know the details of Pablo's arrest. I had given her a reassuring smile and patted her hand and told her not to worry, I wouldn't do anything stupid. It was usually an effective tactic, another one of those tricks I had learned: People were satisfied so long as you were courteous and smiled and made no sudden moves. They were more than satisfied, they were relieved -- such a pleasant surprise to find a well-mannered young black man who didn't seem angry all the time.\"So there lies the explanation for Obama's smooth-saying: an effective tactic, that uses a courteous demeanor and reassuring smile to beguile people into being satisfied with whatever he was saying (while hiding his anger). Moreover, he explains that is also an effective means to deceive (trick) people. This also explains why he manages the amazing feat of continuing to maintain his associations with radicals of all types while maintaining his popular appeal to the mainstream (it looks like the step-father Lolo taught survival skills very well).Those two pages of the 1995 autobiography grabbed this reviewer's attention more than any other portion of the book since they explain so very much about this author.As for rating the book, it is fairly well written and detailed, and provides excellent insights into the author's thinking and experiences (a 5 rating). However, what it reveals is very negative and the book drones on and on throughout with the author preaching his dogmas and all of this makes the book a very unpleasant read, but it was a valuable experience (a 1 to 2 rating). So I gave it an average 3 rating overall. The narrative does not flow chronologically and the account needs to be pieced together as in the manner of solving a puzzle. That is a common literary style and I did not use that for the rating. Anyone that carried out their \"civic duty to vote\" in November 2008 ar any other time in the future should read or have read this book beforehand no matter how pleasant or unpleasant they may find it to read. It will be a basis for a much more informed experience than all of the useless noise emanating from all of the political campaigns.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/424170556", "review_id": "424170556", "date": "Sep 28, 2012", "rating": "", "user_name": "Jessica", "user_url": "/user/show/129974-jessica", "text": "As someone who studies memoir for a living, particularly memoirs of \"ordinary\" people who write extraordinary memoirs, reading this book was a bit surreal, because Obama is exactly the opposite: He's an average memoirist, but an exceptional human being.

Four years later, I remain as much of a political fan of Obama as I ever was, and this book, though not the best memoir, does give a lot of insight into Barack Obama-the-man, which is of obvious historical and political use. But what I really want to talk about here is not the politics but the writing, which reveals much about the writer, though not in the way that he intends, I suspect. The memoir is structured by place-- Hawaii, Chicago, Kenya --an unwise structural choice given that place is not really the focus of the content. The beating heart of this memoir is racial identity in America, which Obama seems afraid to really dive into, but more on that later. Here is what I came to suspect over the course of reading this: Young Barack Obama, after becoming the first African-American editor of The Harvard Law Review, was offered a book deal. He thought that writing about his life would be easy and at first it is--his first chapters are beautiful, lyrical descriptions of childhood scenery interspersed with incisive, witty commentary on racial identity. But then, somewhere in the writing process, Obama-the-writer realizes he's made a big mistake. He begins to dread working on the book, and vows just to finish it, which he does, poorly. In between the lines, you can feel the pressure of the book deadline, his anxiety about the book contract, the weight he puts on his own shoulders to not let his white book agent/editors (I'm assuming they are white because almost all of them are now, let alone in the early 1990s) think that their young black male author can't complete a book about his own life. He finishes it, but the last 100-200 pages of the book are a disaster - there are literally dozens of pages that read like he just transcribed his notebook and called it a day/book/memoir. What's so interesting about this is that, in his political life, Obama is the first to admit (to a fault) that he's an imperfect man. In this memoir, however, you can feel that he knows that the writing isn't doing his story justice, but instead of taking the time to figure out why he tries to cover it up with cliches and platitudes and easy endings (the last scene is literally him toasting \"happy endings\" at his wedding - my college freshmen creative writing students make this mistake ALL THE TIME - as if it is too terrifying to not have a neat, tidy, perfect ending THE END EVERYONE IS GREAT DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME THANKS FOR READING TA-DAH!!!!). It's pretty obvious what Obama needed to make this book excellent - a few more years of time to chill out, mature, revise, and reflect. But of course, Obama spent the next few years doing other things, like becoming the most powerful man in the universe. There's something incredibly telling - and touching - about Obama's ambition to write a memoir like this and his carrying through with it even in the face of obvious failure. What I got from this book is that Obama is extraordinary not so much for his accomplishments (which are, of course, beyond impressive), but for his unwavering and genuine idealism, including his ultra-American dedication to working really fucking hard all the time. His idealism is challenged over and over again, in very significant ways, and he has to assume bizarre philosophical contortions to justify it to himself and others. The writing itself becomes a metaphor for this - the book gets worse and worse, but he has to finish it! He HAS TO DO IT, even if it is imperfect, even if the author has secretly realized that he is not yet old enough to write a good memoir, that he hates writing memoir, that he doesn't want to do it anymore. The irony is, of course, that we are incredibly lucky to have this memoir, no matter how flawed; most politicians hire ghostwriters to ensure that their books are so un-flawed that they are ghastly boring paperweights that no one actually reads. It is important to say here that this is NOT that book. It is rare, precious, and perhaps unprecedented to get this close and personal to a president before they had any real plans for politics (if you think he had plans for office while he was writing this, I will direct your attention to the fact that he casually mentions his quasi-habitual drug use - including cocaine - and that this book was published only a few years after Clinton got so much shit for inhaling/not inhaling a puff of marijuana in the 1960s. That combined with the racial/religious politics makes it pretty clear that it hadn't yet occurred to him yet that he would become a politician, let alone president). You can't blame the guy for not realizing that he'd become president - I mean, he had just a FEW things working against him, politically, like his entire name, and his race, and his 500 crazy half-siblings in Kenya, who make Clinton's insane siblings seem like the Brady Bunch. Oh and the fact he spent several years attending a madrassa in Indonesia and also, as this book makes clear, grew up as an atheist. You know, just a few minor hurdles to the presidency.Which brings me to the greatest irony of the book: though he never says it explicitly, and may not even know it about himself, Barack Obama HATES politics, and is, at his core, a terrible politician. Which is, ironically, why so many of us love him. He is not a schmoozer or even a charmer, not even on the page. His hatred of politics and politicians and political strategy is quite obvious and hilarious to the reader, maybe not so much to him. Obama is like a really, really, earnest high school nerd (who is secretly cool), who has no interest in running for student body president, but who gets so frustrated with the lack textbooks and graphing calculators that he runs for office anyway, even though he knows student government is intellectually boring and will make him miserable and all he really wants to do is read books and smoke cigarettes. In Obama's case, the need to do something that he finds personally distasteful in the service of the greater good is inextricably tied to race. Though much of the book focuses on Obama navigating his identity as a black man, the phrase that kept running through my head--as Obama undertakes a monastic, even masochistic existence as a community organizer in Chicago while his former classmates from Columbia set out to make their bajilllions--was the phrase \"white guilt.\" He never calls it that, in fact, I don't think the phrase \"white guilt\" comes up once in the memoir, which is an interesting omission, considering the political and racial sensibilities of his white mother and grandparents. But the romantic and naive language he uses to describe his life in Chicago will be recognizable to anyone who knows that skinny white vegan dude who was top of his class in college and then spent his whole career teaching 9th grade remedial math to inner-city kids. Barack Obama is THAT guy - in both the good ways and the bad. We all know the white version of this guy because Hollywood loves to make movies about such people - because such movies make white people look good, and racial tension seem solvable. But in Obama's case, his skin color makes things more complicated. He can't be the white Hollywood hero, because he's not white, but he can't be the black one either, because his identity with the black community is only skin deep - he knows it, and the black people around him know it. He never really explains why he chases the African-American identity so fiercely (and most readers, including this one, will be sympathetic to this omission, considering that whether he chooses it or not, he's discriminated against like every other African-American man. And one imagines that, with his marriage to Michelle, he finally achieved the sense of belonging he was looking for - actual familial ties to an African-American family). But just as Obama suffers discrimination as a black man, he suffers guilt as a white one --something he doesn't seem able to fully articulate on the page, but which is obvious in the interactions that he describes between himself (privileged Ivy League grad with white family) and the poor black residents of the Chicago projects, who have no white Hawaiian paradise to return to when times get tough. They keep asking him what the hell he is doing there and he doesn't have much of an answer. In one particularly awkward scene, Obama tells a black woman from Chicago that he wishes he had grown up in a poor black family in Chicago because then he would have a community, and she is like \"uh...I wish I grew up middle class in a tropical paradise\". Like the white-Hollywood-teacher-hero, Obama is fascinated by the anger of the black men he interacts with in Chicago, and this fascination is so detached from his own emotions that it comes across on the page as almost anthropological. Even during the most emotionally fraught interaction Obama has with young black men--Obama yells at a bunch of teenagers to quiet down, then realizes that they might have guns, then becomes ashamed of being frightened by them because it implies his own racism-- is so over-written and over-intellectualized it seems a parody of a racial epiphany. If Obama were in a memoir-writing workshop someone would point out that his hyper-intellectualization of everything is a defense mechanism, the aspect of his personality that has protected him from becoming dangerously angry (and that as a black man in America, self-protection against anger is arguably not just for defense, but for actual life-and-death survival. His lack of anger was certainly a pre-requisite for his political success). But the 20-something Obama who wrote this memoir isn't mature enough to recognize his own defense mechanisms yet (most 20-somethings aren't). And then, as if semi-aware that intellectualizing the righteous, raw, anger of black men is quite a privileged way to spend one's time, he becomes guilty for not being angry. The poor guy cannot win - and that is the point - that to be both black and white in America has its benefits and its perils, the biggest peril being not quite fitting in anywhere. The red herring in all of this, of course, is the father, he of whom the dreams are had. (The passages describing the actual dreams of his father are some of the best writing I've ever read. Writing about dreams is nearly impossible to do without being boring, but Obama's dream writing soars and feels very emotionally authentic). Obama tries to imbue the narrative structure with the following stakes: If the son can solve the mystery of the father, the son will have the key to unlock the mysteries of his own identity. This is standard memoir stuff. The only problem with this is that we, the readers, can tell very early on that Papa Obama (Barack calls him the Old Man) is a Grade-A asshole. And once Obama realizes this for himself (somewhere between Chicago and Kenya), he can't quite process it on the page. He's clearly disappointed, but all he offers by the end is an incredibly forced scene of him weeping at his father's grave in Kenya and then, a few pages later, a happy wedding toast (EVERYTHING IS FINE!! LALALA!), without showing us how, emotionally, he did the work to get there. But at some point, one supposes, he did get there. Years after this book was written and published, he got there. Got there, and lifted a lot of us up with him (I have a pre-existing condition that requires expensive meds, without which I will die. Thanks to him, I don't live in mortal peril of losing my health insurance. This man has literally saved tens of thousands of people's lives). It was impossible for me to read this book without thinking of Obama on his inauguration day, those few moments before he walked out to the podium to be sworn in. There was something about the look on his face that has stayed with me over the past four years, something about him that seemed both recognizably human and yet also super-human. That's the special sauce that makes all of our greatest presidents great, right? That blend of the familiar and the super-human? And in reading this memoir I've realized that Obama has always been both of these things his entire life. The human part - Barry the confused 20-something dude -- doubts himself, makes mistakes, looks dumb sometimes - like we all do. But the super-human - President Barack Obama - is someone who has always believed his struggles mean something, are worth something, are of historical significance. This person knows that very few people can do what he can do, which is why he has to do what he does, even if he doesn't want to. This person believes that every task he sets out to do, no matter how difficult and complex, can be completed, HAS TO BE DONE, even if the results will always, inevitably, be less than perfect.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/887237695", "review_id": "887237695", "date": "Mar 20, 2014", "rating": 3, "user_name": "S.", "user_url": "/user/show/15659828-s", "text": "it's Friday 0920 in the morning and though I've sort of internally committed to myself to make Mondays and Fridays fully off-guesthouse in order to relieve the burden on my housemates of my unemployed presence, still, since we've entered the last of March (the traditional spring vacation month) and because it's spring, I suppose there's no major, major harm in doing the book update, the fictional blog, the randomness text screen. plus also there's finally no one present in the common room.interesting how quickly we adjust to new circumstances, from my low-level brushfire insurgency against the 9 of Clubs and the 8 of Spades to harmony, warmth, and spring vibrations across the plain of Kanto, or \"Edinburgh,\" or wherever else this fictional nonfiction is going.

Not because I didn't enjoy it though. I feel I should also point out, as I didn't know before I started, this book covers the early portion of Barack Obama's life. From his childhood right up to when he goes to law school at Harvard. Primarily the book is an autobiography of his early years in Hawaii, his college years, and then his time in Chicago where he works in some of the poorest communities and his time in Africa visiting family.The book is challenging. More so than I was expecting. It is a quest, in a way. It's a book about a man trying to find his place in the world. A man of many worlds. Belonging to both and neither. With a white mother and a black father, one from Africa no less, and an unusual name, there's a lot for him to think about. A lot for him to process. A less thoughtful person, a less introspective and caring person, might ignore the past, the weight of it, the responsibility to history, but also the responsibility to family, to your heritage, and just get on with life. It would be simpler but I suspect not as fulfilling. Nor would it have shaped him in the same way.This is story about a boy with an absent father who hears countless stories about him before they finally meet. It's a story about a boy growing up in Hawaii, and then spending time abroad in Indonesia, being exposed to several very different ways of life, different beliefs and cultures, while bearing witness to the struggle of his parents, grandparents and later his siblings and extended family in Africa. It made him worldly and gave him a broader perspective than many people through his first hand experience.It's about a man trying to come to terms with the truth about his father, the many truths to be fair, and the many tales that were told, some surely inflated to protect the innocent. It's a story about a man coming face to face with some of the hardships people face, every day, in the poor neighbourhoods of Chicago. The guns. The drugs. The single mothers. The decaying infrastructure. The unemployment and the struggle for people to survive and prosper. It's also a book about guilt. The guilt of people wanting to escape those troubled areas of a city, move to somewhere better and just start over, never thinking about what is left behind or trying to fix it.After reading this book, I feel that anything I write will sound trite. It's difficult to explain what this book meant to me. I haven't gone through the same struggles but there are some parallels in my life that enabled me to connect in a way I had not anticipated. On a level I hadn't expected, making it a very emotional read. I thought the book would simply provide me with insight into a fascinating man who I actually knew very little about who rose to the highest office in America. He made history by being the first black President of the United States. For me the book was more. So much more.At the end, I believe I know what motivates him a little more than before. I can't claim to know the author, but I have a little bit of insight into what drives him. I also came away with a few impressions, which are simply my own observations so others might disagree. I believe him to be an incredibly thoughtful man, a dreamer and someone constantly striving to find a place that he belongs. As I said the book is a quest, and he crosses the globe, meeting family and visiting all the places that resonate with his different parts of his family. I also think that during this early part of his story, despite having friends and family, he was incredibly lonely. With a wife and children later in life, I'm sure that has now changed, but the account here tells of someone constantly searching for something that someone else can't provide. He's not looking for comfort or companionship. He's looking for a sense of self, an identity and a place in the world.A wonderful book, but not one to race through, as there's much in there to think about.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3427350207", "review_id": "3427350207", "date": "Nov 17, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Kristina", "user_url": "/user/show/91938864-kristina", "text": "\"It had nothing to do with good or bad, he explained, like or dislike.

A few reviews from others who walked the path from Michelle's book mentioned it wasn't as impactful as her novel, but Barack delivered a masterpiece. His story is so unique and while I can relate to a small handful of experiences he had growing up, there is a whole world of experiences that I could not even begin to comprehend if he had not laid it out in this novel, and even then, it's a very limited, second-hand understanding (an understanding Squared, if you will). From his upbringing in Hawaii and Indonesia to his formative years in Chicago and Africa, this is chock full of stories, experiences, growth, and maybe most importantly, the sociological analysis provided through the timeline of thought in Barack's mind. \"...difficulty that faced any black business\u2014the barriers to entry, the lack of finance, the leg up that your competitors possessed after having kept you out of the game for over three hundred years.\"The socio-psychological analysis is astute and left me breathless in so many areas. Some of the points he makes I knew about, read about, or even had a funny feeling of, \"yeah this doesn't seem too right but I can't put my finger on it\". To give tangible meaning and diction to why those areas feel wrong made me feel validated and cemented my views, while giving me a way to articulate it if/when the situation arises. Again, my understanding of the experiences are limited, but to be armed with ammunition for those inevitable political or sociological discussions that do arise in a 99% white family, I'm hopeful that the insight the book provided can allow me to further articulate points of view of BIPOC in those discussions.\"But for the black child, everything\u2019s turned upside down. From day one, what\u2019s he learning about? Someone else\u2019s history. Someone else\u2019s culture. Not only that, this culture he\u2019s supposed to learn is the same culture that\u2019s systematically rejected him, denied his humanity.\"Even more importantly, I think, as a white woman reading this novel, there were so many other areas I had not questioned or even thought about that Barack forced me to engage with. My horizons were expanded further past my own experiences and understanding of the world around me, broadened to hopefully be more inclusive, accepting, and be a better advocate in conversations with white/family friends. Finally, to read this knowing this was before his Senate race, before either of his presidential campaigns, is sort of a treat in itself. You get to see this young, raw, honest look at Barack. You hear him outline his motivations and past experiences that led him, motivated him, deterred him, and navigated him to where he was at the time of the novel. To see this pre-presidential, pre-'political' view from him is awestriking, and I am eager to read Audacity of Hope and A Promised Land to witness the evolution of Barack via his books as he progresses through Presidency and beyond.

I\u2019m so happy I immersed myself into it, printed in 1995 after he got a book deal after being elected as the first black president of Harvard\u2019s Law Review, the most prestigious student position at Harvard, in 1990. I laugh thinking about his confession in A Promised Land that he procrastinated and procrastinated until he was up against the wall of his deadline to finish writing it. Finally published in 1995, it was a modest success. It was republished in 2005 and added as an audio book, just after he hit lightning in a bottle with his famous DNC keynote address for John Kerry in 2004.It is a moving account of his childhood and his forbears on his mother and father\u2019s side. On his mother\u2019s side were his middle America, Kansas born and bred, grandparents, of the WWII greatest generation who knew sacrifice and hard work pursuing the traditional American dream. His father, having left when he was two remained an enigma in his life. It wasn\u2019t until he visited Kenya in his 20\u2019s (well after his father\u2019s death) that he met his paternal relatives. It was then that he really came to terms with his mixed race heritage.This is not to say that this is a boring story of ancestors and angst. He brings to vivid life his time in Bali living with his mother and step father, getting into all kinds of mischief. It was there that his mother made a commitment to enhance the less than satisfactory schooling on Bali with correspondence courses that he had to study at 4am each day. She also felt he wasn\u2019t being exposed to moral principles, she told him, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to grow into a decent human being, you\u2019re going to need some values,\u201d She stressed the importance of integrity, honesty, strength of character with a belief in curiosity and the value of a good education every day.In fact, that is why she sent him back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents to attend a prestigious private school. He describes his life then as a normal kid loving basketball, experimenting with drugs, smoking and chasing girls. About as ordinary as most kids his age, we see the stirrings of his extraordinary future. I admired his open willingness to tell the story of his youth, warts and all.

I picked it up as background while I wait for A Promised Land, and I\u2019m so glad I did. Like my kids, Barak Obama is an adult TCK, a Third Culture Kid, one who spent a significant part of his formative years in a culture different from his parents\u2019 home cultures. I loved his account of running with the Indonesian boys when he lived in Bali with his mother and his Indonesian step-father. He conveys fond memories of that culture even though the marriage didn\u2019t last. Near the end of the book, he encounters the complicated relationships of his Kenyan family, which no doubt contributed to how he sees himself in the world\u2014fortunate, but responsible for more than just himself.Obama is truly a TCK. He isn\u2019t completely comfortable in his mother and grandparent\u2019s home culture of white America. He admits to struggling with his identity as a young black man. He was shielded from so much as a boy, partly because as a TCK, you know you are different; what\u2019s the big deal? (He doesn\u2019t mention that part!) Growing up with white grandparents, his confidence was already strongly established before he realized that the color of his skin could make a difference in how he is perceived. He admits to years as a teen giving his grandparents grief as he experimented with the identity he saw in his Black and Hawaian peers before getting involved in community action in Chicago to organize the communities to take control of their own situation. The whole book, written while he was a law student in Chicago, looks at his early life through the lens of race, analysing in retrospect feelings and attitudes he didn\u2019t understand as a boy. The book goes up to his visit to Kenya, where he learned more of his father\u2019s life (he already had a wife and children when he came to Hawaii to study and met Obama\u2019s mother) and the complicated polygamous family he came from. He shows insights into Kenyan culture that I enjoyed having been there and taught there. Barak, Sr., sounded very much like the go-gitter reputation of the Luo people, and I was not surprised by the ups and downs of Kenyan politics.Barak Obama is not just a celebrity. He writes beautifully with understanding and apt descriptors. The audiobook is read by him in that calm, confident voice I have missed so much the past four years. It included his 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention when he nominated John Kerry. I wanted to stand to my feet and applaud! I wanted to get my conservative relatives to listen and say, \u201cThese are my values.

This is a personal memoir, not a policy or campaign book, and because it is rich in character and dialogue, it reads like a novel. It\u2019s a journey into his racial identity \u2013 something you rarely hear him talk about these days. He describes his personal issues, specifically the feelings of growing up without a father and the lack of identity that comes from being of mixed race. As a (barely published) writer myself, I\u2019m aware of how much I reveal about my own character even in my fiction. Obama is so open and honest in this book, I grew to admire him more and more as I went further into the book. I feel like I really know the man who\u2019s leading my country now, and I trust him more because he was willing to reveal himself so openly. I think of his book as \u201cpersonal transparency,\u201d an idea whose time has come just as much as ethical, financial, and political transparency. It fits right in with the blogging phenomenon. Some people have complained that blogging is exhibitionism, saying that nothing is sacred or private anymore. But blogging or social networking through the Internet has an undeniably positive side to it. People are communicating with other people. And when we connect with each other as human beings, we can find common ground and build for peace. This is what Obama has done with his book. He connects on a human level. That\u2019s personal transparency.The book is divided into three parts: \u201cOrigins,\u201d which spans his childhood through his graduation from college; \u201cChicago,\u201d about his years as a community activist; and \u201cKenya,\u201d about his visit with his father\u2019s family. The \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cKenya\u201d sections were the most moving, but affected me very differently. \u201cChicago,\u201d as I said, is about Obama\u2019s years as a community activist in the poor, back neighborhoods of Chicago. The section includes not just Obama\u2019s personal story but the stories of the people he worked with and tried to help. Chapter 10 contains some particularly moving stories, followed by what is possibly the most definitive part of the book, a description of how personal transparency and activism meet. It\u2019s so good, I read it aloud to my two older sons, and wish I could photocopy all of it for my son\u2019s anti-Obama history teacher, but I don\u2019t think it would make much difference to him: \u201cThat\u2019s what the leadership was teaching me, day by day: that the self-interest I was supposed to be looking for extended well beyond the immediacy of issues, that beneath the small talk and sketchy biographies and received opinions people carried within them some central explanation of themselves. Stories full of terror and wonder, studded with events that still haunted or inspired them. Sacred stories. \u201cAnd it was this realization, I think, that finally allowed me to share more of myself with the people I was working with, to break out of the larger isolation that I had carried with me to Chicago. I was tentative at first, afraid that my prior life would be too foreign for South Side sensibilities; that I might somehow disturb people\u2019s expectations of me. Instead, as people listened to my stories of Toot or Lolo or my mother or father, of flying kites in Djakarta or going to school dances at Punahou, they would nod their heads or shrug or laugh. . . Then they\u2019d offer a story to match or confound mine, a knot to bind our experiences together \u2013 a lost father, an adolescent brush with crime, a wondering heart, a moment of simple grace. As time passed, I found that these stories taken together, had helped me bind my world together, that they gave me the sense of place and purpose I\u2019d been looking for. Marty [his boss] was right: There was always a community there if you dug deep enough. . . There was poetry as well \u2013 a luminous world always present beneath the surface, a world that people might offer up as a gift to me, if I only remembered to ask.\u201dThis section also describes the beginnings of his involvement with Reverend Wright, whose comments about Israel had me distrusting Obama and supporting McKean for many months. In any case, Obama\u2019s community work kept him in communication with many Chicago churches, though his co-organizers commented that he personally did not seem to be particularly religious. He then describes the first time he heard one of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermon, entitled \u201cThe Audacity of Hope.\u201d He used that phrase in the keynote speech that he gave at the Democratic Convention of \u201904 and it is also the title of his more recent campaign book, so clearly, the concept moved him. But after reading Reverend Wright\u2019s sermon, I\u2019m convinced he sees at as more of a political than religious phrase. Reverend Wright began with the story of the childless Chanah who went to pray at the Mishkan (Tabernacle) even though her situation seemed so hopeless. He then compared her situation to that of blacks through slavery and poverty \u2013 how it is audacious to hope for good amidst adversity. To compare it to Jewish experiences, to \u201cbind our experiences together,\u201d I imagined Jews keeping Torah observances in the concentration camps. Now I\u2019d say that\u2019s audacity in the face of the Nazis, but I\u2019d never call it audacity or hope in relation to G-d. I\u2019d call that \u201cThe Challenge of Bitachon,\u201d or in English, \u201cThe Challenge of Trust.\u201d I don\u2019t think Chanah was being audacious for praising G-d despite her troubles; she was turning to Him because in times of trouble, He\u2019s the only one to turn to. But Reverend Wright preaches against \u201cprayerful passivism,\u201d which seems rather atheistic to me. Prayer is passive? I consider prayer is my main form of political activism. I\u2019m always davening (praying) for peace and for G-d to spare innocent lives in spite of all the wars in the world. And I trust that I\u2019m getting answered somehow, too. All in all, the \u201cChicago\u201d section inspired me to become more politically active. As proof, my follow-up book is Spiritual Activism by Rabbi Avi Weiss. If my activism is going to include more than just prayer, I\u2019ve still got to do it as I do everything \u2013 in a Torahdiggeh way. Inspiring as the \u201cChicago\u201d section was, the \u201cKenya\u201d section really is the climactic ending. It transports you to such a different world that you\u2019re almost in a different book, and it makes you feel Africa. The polygamy was a bit shocking to my Western mind, and the family ties were almost dizzying in their complexity, but the affects of colonialism and post-colonialism are explained with human example, just as in the rest of the book. The very best part is not even in Obama\u2019s voice, but his grandmother\u2019s. She becomes the \u201cI\u201d of the narrative, telling him the story of his father and grandfather. And once Obama has heard the full story, he\u2019s finally at peace with who he is.I recommend this book to everyone in the world, and I mean that literally. After all, President Obama is going to affect all of our lives, and I think this book teaches us more about his character than any political speech, especially since it was written in the 1990\u2019s before his political career when he was under much less pressure to present a particular type of image. It\u2019s an intelligent, well-written, and above all, human story. Get to know his vision of how to improve the world.

This was one of those. It is interesting to compare Michelle's book to Barack's. Michelle's, I think, was pretty much straight forward and explained her background and growing up years, and white house experience. This one was a whole lot of soul searching. I actually did find it mostly fascinating. I didn't realize what a good thinker and writer he was. Maybe because I'm not male, and I'm not Black, I can't relate as much to his insistence on understanding his Black roots. He didn't really know his father - and we get to know him only through stories people told of him. His mother, though, seems much more of a footnote. She was around, available most of the time, and I know he loved her, but I don't think the reader gets to know her as well as the father. It's nice that Obama can get to \"know\" his Kenyan father from the rest of his relatives, especially when he goes to visit there after his father's death. I can't help but wonder, though, if his father had been from the US or Canada, if he would have worked as hard to get to know him. I'm probably reading too much into all this.He was 33 when he wrote the book, amazingly! His father left Hawaii when he was only two, and he didn't see him again til he was about 10 as I recall. In the meantime, he also lived in Indonesia for a while, and his mom married a man from there. While he lived there, he took a correspondence class in English that began ago 4:00am his time. What a dedicated mom to impress the importance of an education! She wouldn't let him take the easy way out. I think Obama, like most people no matter what color they are, was searching for his identity, what made him HIM. And is there an answer to life's difficult questions? Is life supposed to be fair? Can we understand things? And can we change things for the better? If so - how? I loved his idea But, he finds probably that people are the same everywhere. There are always going to be those that are willing to work hard, and some that are willing to always be on the receiving end of things. Those that keep promises and those that don't. Life is never tidy, nor easy. There is no rule book as to who we are supposed to become, how we are supposed to behave in every situation, no one \"right\" path to follow. So - very interesting.

In this memoir, Obama reflects on his origins and his beginnings as the multiracial child of a white American woman and a Kenyan man. In the process he meditates on what it means to identify as black, despite the absence of his father. Written back in the days before he was an elected official, there is a refreshing candour in this memoir that is not found in his later works. Though Obama had always been open and frank, Dreams From My Father is particularly so. It was interesting to read this book in 2021. I get the feeling that the man who wrote it never dreamed of becoming president, and yet there mark of greatness and possibility is stamped all over the narrative.Despite being the first black President of the United States, some have criticized Obama for being too conciliatory when it comes to race relations. Where many feel and express anger, Obama, particularly in his political life, has always expressed himself with measure and restraint, recognizing his role as uniter. It\u2019s a role that he plays well but the criticism is valid. In reading this autobiography, likely the most unguarded Obama has ever been, his perspective remains clear-eyed and optimistic. While this is of course appealing to some, I imagine it can also be frustrating when the reality doesn\u2019t match the dream. Writers like Paul Beatty in his novel The Sellout and Ta Nehisi Coates in his articles for The Atlantic have justifiably taken Obama to task for not speaking with the same frankness about race as he does about income equality and universal healthcare. Indeed, people looking for an unvarnished look at what it means to be a Black person in America would do better than to read this memoir. That said, there is merit in the Obama perspective. Despite what his critics say, his story and his perspective is inspirational and aspirational.I found this book moving and incredibly readable.

The way we wrote these stories really got my attention and I was focused on learning more about him.This book is definitely a book that should be read by someone who wants to learn more about Barack Obama and see what his like was life before becoming president. Because this book was written before he was even in the running for his first presidential term, it gives a well written outlook and his occupation and home life before presidency. Obama went above and beyond in this book in telling his story. It is heartfelt and powerful and shows so many wonderful characteristics of him as a person and a writer.

Lorenzo\u2019s review also stated that if you are a fan of Obama\u2019s politics or not, you should challenge yourself to reading this book which I also agree with. There is so much more to this book than just politics and it is very easy to look beyond the politics talked about in it.Furthermore, a review named Michelle stated the book provides a better understanding of the life of Barack Obama but also a better understanding of who he is and why he is the way he is. The book provides an in-depth background of his life and why he is the way he is. It shows who he is and how and why he presents himself the way he does. This book makes people respect him more because of his background and what he had to go through to be this way.In this book, Obama takes the story of his life and puts it in an interesting and intriguing manner.

Barack Obama stands for many important things I believe in, the largest of which being equality, especially in the form of racism. As the first black president I knew he had to endure much racism and overcome it in a way not seen before, but I came to discover that this was a story about embracing race, not overcoming it; I expected an intriguing memoir that I would hopefully be able to draw from in my own life. I was overwhelmed by basic information that I had never known about him. He is a melting pot of different cultures: born to a Kenyan man and a white woman from Kansas, born in and raised in Hawaii, and lived also in Jakarta, New York City, and Chicago, which is known for its gap between rich white people and poorer black people, but Barack Obama went and faced racism straight in the face to be able to overcome it. The novel ends with former president Obama in Kenya finding out about his roots (comparable to the TV show, Roots), and feeling as though knowing where he comes from makes him feel complete.This was the completeness, or closure that he needed to feel before he could go on with his calling to make change for black people. Now that he had felt this intimate relationship with who he was, he was ready to fight for this part of himself. I struggle with racism because I am mixed raced. I felt that the takeaway from this book, to my life, was that you need to know and appreciate your own culture, whether that be multiple or singular, to know yourself better. As Barack Obama questioned, does praising your own culture mean you must bring down other cultures? No, but knowing more about your own culture is a means of connecting to those who share that with you and coming together even in differences with those who have different cultures as you do.

I first read this book in the summer of 2009, the summer between finishing my MBA and starting my first job. Barack Obama had become the President of the United States a few months before, and this book that he had written in the early 90s had been re-published. The fervour was such that a copy had found its way to my father's library in the tiny city of Trivandrum, very very far away from Washington, D.C. I read it very quickly, I remember, and was completely swept away by it; I thought it one of the most inspiring and beautiful books I had ever read. Twelve years later, I picked it up again purely out of curiosity. I had recently listened to the audiobook of the first part of Obama's autobiography and discovered that the guy could still write (though parts of it did feel plodding and heavy). I wanted to see if his first book would still appeal to me the way it had when I was 22.My reaction this time wasn't as OTT as last time, but I still found it moving and beautifully written. This book was written before he ran for any election, remember - he hadn't even run for the Illinois Senate then, never mind the presidency. The biggest thing he had done till then was becoming the Editor of the Harvard Law Review (which was, of course, a big enough deal that it got him a book deal). What makes this book so beautiful, even for someone who isn't American? More than anything, I think it's Obama's struggles with his own racial identity that makes this book so moving, the way he struggles to reconcile the whiteness of his family with the realization of his own blackness (and all that it implied in an unequal world). As he grows up, the pain and loneliness increases, the realization that his own family is separated from him by skin colour, that they can never understand what he is going through and will have to go through all his life. How much that must have hurt him, how lonely he must have felt. Of course, we know that he gets through it, becoming more successful arguably than any other black man before him. But the journey is a long one, from the golden sands of Hawaii to college in California and New York to the South Side of Chicago (where he tried to organize communities to claim their rights) and finally to Kenya, to the land of his absent father and the other side of his family. There, finally, the story seems to come full circle for him, he appears to find the answers he has been searching for.

There is not really a \u2018how to\u2019 book on living as a black man in America... especially if one has no father to emulate. Barack saw the black men and boys around him and knew he wanted more from life than what they are pursuing. But it was considered (in the time and place he was) to be \u2018too white\u2019 to have higher goals and aspirations than his black peers. He poignantly describes what it was to struggle with where to belong, when you don\u2019t \u2018belong\u2019 with a father. He does not shy away from talking about his flaws, weaknesses and fears... or even his bad choices. I can\u2019t say enough about the respect that I have for Obama as a person. This book helped me understand the background stories that built him into the kind of man he is today. Family mattered deeply to him... that is evident in the book as he sought to know, understand, forgive, and connect with his family in Kenya. Family matters tremendously to him now.

With my respect & admiration for this family, I'm going to give my best attempt of reviewing this memoir with my unbiased opinion. I'm going to begin by focusing on the negative. Precisely the way every politically correct business book instructs you not to offer feedback. I feel that this book lacks significant structure. Barack divides this book into three segments: his early childhood, his community organizer days within New York & Chicago, and lastly his birthright trip to Kenya. I believe Obama was attempting to portray his immigrant upbringing while connecting it to his journey to find himself. Trying to find your personal identity is difficult and to do that with minimal adult guidance is near impossible. Obama was attempting to explain that the world isn't black and white. The \"superheroes\" or \"villains\" that you create can be drastically misinterpreted. I understand what Obama was trying to portray but I do feel that it wasn't clear. His focus of detail on people within the memoir that didn't need explaining left pockets of dryness forcing me to push through in hopes of a more compelling story to come. Luckily, there was more. Dreams from my father gives a intimate & exclusive view into Barack Obama's earlier years. Obama wrote this book at 33 years old when he was still studying at Harvard and a senator. I'm 25 years old and can only dream of being as articulate as him in 8 years. He is a true wordsmith extraordinaire. A random anecdote that I noticed was his addiction to cigarettes. I don't personally smoke, but I was living vicariously through Obama has he took a drag from each cigarette. Praying that each exhale of breath would eliminate the stress that culminated within him.While he didn't attain a significant amount of accolades, he still felt compelled to write a short story on his journey to self discovery.

His experiences in immediately post-colonial Indonesia and the gradual piecing together of his father\u00b4s similar Kenyan experience give the whole a very complete picture of the way in which race, religion, and tribe divide us, and of ways in which government might be able to help mend these things.

In terms of what the book is saying, this isn't the story I wanted to hear. I think I'll find that story in his latest book The Promised Land, but that is not the fault of the book.

Obama's lineage consisted of individuals from both sides of the political aisle, a microcosm of the American divide within his own family. However, growing up in Wichita and Hawaii, racial discussions were rarely on the table. His family was raised to treat every individual with mutual respect, regardless of background. Humble beginnings of Barack's childhood taught him humility as he watched his single mother provide for him and his sister. Through multiple jobs, his mother still made time to teach Barack about the importance of the civil rights marchers and the meaning of growing up black in America. He learned that his father preached about equality for all regardless of racial, social, or economic background; he learned about how his mother and grandparents defied threats from their neighbors as they befriended their local black residents. Throughout all the stories in the book, it is easy to see how Obama was destined for the career he had. He carried forward his family's message of equality and justice for black America to inspire his work in civil service and his future political agenda. This book is a great read (or listen) for anyone wanting to learn about the true inspiration for Obama's political career. It paints a beautiful picture of the racial undertones in America and the Obamas' vision of an equal country.

It starts with Barack Obama hearing the news that his father has been killed in a car accident in Kenya. Then we take a step back and Obama describes his mother's childhood and how her family made its way from Kansas to Hawaii where she met her future husband. We learn about about Obama's childhood in Hawaii and also in Indonesia. It was also fascinating to learn about Obama's work as a community organizer in Chicago. Toward the end of the book, Obama takes a trip to Africa to meet his family there, and we learn so much about the history of his family there and the work his father did to make a better life for himself and his family.One thing I found very interesting is that Obama was forced into a culture that didn't belong to either of his parents. His mother is white, and he was raised with her and his white grandparents, but being a black man in America, was a part of the African American culture even though that culture belonged to neither of his parents (since his father was from Africa, and not the US). Not being American or Black myself, I probably don't really understand all the nuance of these cultural differences, but I did really appreciate the perspectives and stories told here.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["audiobook", "non-fiction", "2021", "memoir"]}, {"book_id_title": "88061.Dreams_from_My_Father", "book_id": "88061", "book_title": "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/899342603", "review_id": "899342603", "date": "Mar 14, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Maryanne Henderson", "user_url": "/user/show/27419961-maryanne-henderson", "text": "This was an excellent biography, Obama's writing style is as lyrical as his speaking style is powerful. Covering the period of his toddler years to just before he started his law degree at Harvard (with an epilogue covering Harvard and touching on his wedding day), this book reads more like a work of fiction. In fact my only cynical comment might be that I wonder how Obama's memory could be so good, to describe locations and people so well, but many people have wonderful, vivid memories.With amazing descriptive detail, Obama recounts the people and places of his past, and opens to the reader the conflicts of a young man trying to fit between more than one culture, more than one race. By the end, I believe that Obama's experiences within his family; the touches he has with those who are white, black, Christian, Muslim, coupled with his recounted interest in really defining who he was and how all these elements fit together to make him a great moderator and the caring President he was. As a young community organizer, he pays attention to the changing economy in the US and its affect on youth; people not much younger than himself. He writes of speaking with a Reverend in Chicago about the influence of the Christian Church as a place where the ideas of 'survival, and freedom, and hope' stayed on in stubborn insistence (p.273) - ideas that would come to play in his presidency bid and next book. He writes of an older generation, who fought for civil rights in the 1960s \"... believing then that they marched for a higher purpose, for rights and for principles and for God's children but who at some point had realized that power was unyielding and principles unstable, and that even after laws were passed and lynchings ceased, the closest thing to freedom would still involve escape , emotional if not physical, away from ourselves, away from what we knew, flight into the outer reaches of the white man's empire - or closer into its bosom.\"He writes of living and working in Chicago, when the first black mayor dies of a heart attack, leaving a political organization in shambles without its charismatic leader; he writes of talking to a Kenyon he doesn't want to pay taxes but understands that this means the roads won't be of good quality, he writes of hope and cynicism.

It's clear that the author, while a politician in life, once had aspirations of being a writer. There is the timeless attempt at the hero's journey, of finding one's self, of poetic language all echoing an idea of trying to find a place among multiple worlds. It's a bit structurally flat at times but feels authentic in these moments.A lot of this hits close to home. I can empathize with the differences between the Old World and the New; between developing countries and the States; between this coast and that. Strangely, the aspect of coming from a former British colony struck me as a very shaping force in the Obama clan's life history. I feel like I know the man better after this. He's still a politician, yes, but I would like too see this author's writing style compared to others' in Congress. Whither the love of the English language?

The memoir is divided into three sections: Origins, Barack's childhood and early memories; Chicago, which describes his years, after undergrad, working as a community organizer in Chicago; Kenya concerns his 1st homecoming trip to Kenya before the start of law school. The edition I read contains a Preface to the 2004 Edition, written by Obama, in which he states the urge to cut the book by fifty pages or so. ix I agree with that. At times it felt as if he was including too much and writing a diary/daily account of his activities rather than a memoir. Some sections flowed more smoothly than others. He has some pieces of great writing, such as this:The wind whipped up cold and sharp as a blade, and I watched a handmade sign tumble past me. HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON, the sign read in heavy block letters. And beneath the words that picture I had seen so many times while waiting for a chair in Smitty's Barbershop: the handsome, grizzled face; the indulgent smile; the twinkling eyes; now blowing across the empty space, as easily as an autumn leaf. 289I have discovered, reading this, that I'm not all that interested in politics and it was a struggle to read all of the details on Obama's grass roots, community organizing work. Although, it was in this section, where I saw glimmers of Obama's presidential character manifesting, and that was exciting. Reading this, you see his maturing process, and something happens during these grass roots days to make him a great listener and negotiator. He genuinely connects with people, and he can neutrally see all sides of an argument. What comes across is his great care and faithfulness for the people he represents. Here is an example. This is an excerpt where he describes a man that he seems to disagree with, although, it's hard to tell, because he's so fair in his treatment of everyone. More than once, I'd have to jump in and start shouting back at him, not so much in anger as simply to slow him down, until finally a small smile would curl under his mustache and we could get back to work. When the two of us were alone, though, Rafiq and I could sometimes have normal conversations. Over time I arrived at a grudging admiration for his tenacity and bravado, and, within his own terms, a certain sincerity.  Plus, he's still so very young here, he hasn't even begun graduate school yet. His wisdom and maturity are impressive for this young age.  My favorite section is the final chapters describing his trip to Kenya. He struggled with his identity as a black man, mostly because his father was absent from his life. His mother and grandparents did a fantastic job of raising him and nurturing in him the love of his father through the telling of good stories of this absent man. These stories carried Obama along until he was able to discover his father by connecting with his Kenyan family.  This is a strong section of the book and he covers a lot of territory: describing his family, the beauty of Africa, the history of Africa and how that history has influenced the present day, all woven together quite well. In his description of the effects of colonialism on Africa all I could think, while reading, was that he could be describing, equally well, the very same effects on Native American reservations.In our village, more families now wore the white man's clothes, and more fathers agreed to send their children to mission school. Of course, even those who went to school could not do the things the white man did. Only whites were allowed to buy certain land or run certain businesses....Some men began to try to organize against these policies, to petition and hold demonstrations. But their numbers were few, and most people just struggled to live. Those Africans who did not work as laborers stayed in their villages, trying to maintain the old ways. But even in the villages, attitudes changed. The land was crowded, for with new systems of land ownership, there was no longer room for sons to start their own plots - everything was owned by someone. Respect for tradition weakened, for young people saw that the elders had no real power. Beer which once had been made of honey and which men drank only sparingly, now came in bottles, and many men became drunks. Many of us began to taste the white man's life, and we decided that compared to him, our lives were poor.  401  Here, again, you see Obama's ability to connect with people. Yes, these people are Obama's family, but this is the very first time that he's met the majority of them, and he's able to get along well with everyone. Also, in this section, Obama includes little details which describe everyday life in Kenya. And in the silent background, you feel the constant presence of Africa. The women were gathered on straw mats under the shade of a mango tree while Granny braided Auma's hair and Zeituni braided the hair of a neighbor's girl.....I asked Granny to start from the beginning. How did our greatgrandfather Obama come to live in Kendu? Where did our grandfather work? Why did the Old Man's mother leave? As she started to answer, I felt the wind lift then die. A row of high clouds crossed over the hills. and under the fanning shade of the mango tree, as hands wove black curls into even rows, I heard all our voices begin to run together, the sound of three generations tumbling over each other like the currents of a slow-moving stream, my questions like rocks roiling the water, the breaks in memory separating the currents, but always the voices returning to that single course, a single story... 392 & 394 This memoir covers a lot!

You definitely don't have to be an Obama supporter to enjoy this book, as there is very little in it that I would consider political.

He is also a very talented writer; even the parts that kind of drug on (his time working in Chicago and his first trip to Africa) were enjoyable to read because of his writing style.I think the thing that struck me most was the fact that when this book was written (1995) and even in the updated preface (2004) you don't get the impression that he ever would have guessed he was going to be president.
