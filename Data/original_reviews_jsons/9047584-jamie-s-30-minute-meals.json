Apparently, he's been on tv for years...lol. The food is gorgeous, healthy, substantial.However, there's no way that these are \"quick, throw-together\" recipes. At least one ingredient in each recipe is difficult to obtain (suggesting websites for online ordering). I had to google ingredients to even understand what the American translations would be.Finally, I found one to try to duplicate, with less exotic ingredients I could find in grocery stores. Without going into great detail, I will say that it was a disaster. I made a wrong turn when I decided last-minute I did not want to put raw sausage in my blender (to add further spices to the meat-mixture). What was the point of all this? I almost forgot in the middle of the ordeal -- making a new pasta sauce from scratch (although sausage-based). Needless to say, my picture did not look like their picture. And I'm not a slouch in the kitchen, really.The book did inspire me to cook something, but he doesn't translate well to typical, suburban American life. Martha could take him with one hand behind her back, in delivering beautiful, quality new dishes to try, with just the right amount of challenge.His methods for reducing time are sort of interesting, though, and pretty much involve chopping all ingredients with one swipe of the knife or not chopping at all (boiling entire head of cauliflower) (let it fall apart after or as it cooks) and always keeping a kettle of water boiling to add to other pots, eliminating the wait for those to come to a boil.I have since become more aware of Jamie and his efforts to take on corporate McDonald's (I believe his statement accused them of feeding food not fit for dogs to humans on a worldwide scale) and to improve the horrid food served in public schools.

It includes the recipes and shows you how to use your time to prepare the individual dishes so a complete, rather impressive meal is ready all at once. This is not a bad idea in theory. In practice, it is tricky, because you may want to have an individual dish without having the entire meal. Also, several people follow \"restrictive\" diets (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, etc.) and this cookbook is more geared towards those who are fairly open to all foods.That said, although there are some slightly advanced cooking skills required, I think this book may appeal to the beginning cook who is still developing the \"flow\" to creating an entire meal. It reminds me a Whole Foods or Central Market cooking class in which people build cooking competence and enthusiasm by cooking a wonderful full meal under the guidance of a pro. We all have to start somewhere in the kitchen and it's far more rewarding to end with a Jamie Oliver created meal than mac & cheese (not that there's anything wrong with mac & cheese, of course.)Jamie encourages cooks to use ethical, higher welfare food sources. Thanks, Jamie! You have earned a bonus star for this. There are also a variety of recipes that draw from several types of cuisine. I can't say that anyone would necessarily cook every meal in this book, but I think even the pickiest eaters could find ones to enjoy.Finally, I believe Jamie Oliver is genuine in his love for food and for his concern about others' health.

For example, the Green Thai Curry works as well with Quorn pieces as with Chicken. I also find it very helpful that there is a colour photograph of every meal, so I know what I am aiming for.

I consider myself to be an experienced home cook and I have a very well equipped kitchen with all manner of appliances to assist me in the cooking process. Jamie says in the book that you need to have certain essential pieces of equipment in order to be able to make the recipes in 30 minutes. I have the equipment, I have the know how but there is absolutely no chance I'd ever be able to cook these recipes in 30 minutes. In fact I'm not sure I'd manage some of them in 60 minutes. Unless of course, I was highly excitable and hyperactive... like Jamie Oliver I guess.The recipes jump around all over the place so that the cook can theoretically get the entire meal (usually a main, side dish or entree and dessert) prepared in 30 minutes. It is a bit difficult to follow if you're only making one portion of the meal that appeals to you. In fact the format is a bit hard to follow in general and this is only compounded by the sense of urgency of having 'many pots on the boil'. However I'd challenge anyone to flick through this book and not find several recipes that appeal to them.

The book is divided into actual meals--for example--smoked salmon, potato salad, beets and cottage cheese and homemade butter. Each meal has a list of ingredients to have on hand and steps for preparing the meal. But what if I wanted the potato salad recipe? Sadly, the font is too small to rbe functional while cooking and one has to ferret out the recipes, making this book useless in my kitchen. I wondered who Jamie imagined his readers were for this book? Not people who already cook, I guess. I liked some of the recipes but I'm an experienced cook, looking for time cutting ideas not whole meal plans. Another irritation was the over-the-top photography which includes plenty of photos of Jamie Oliver. In the first 50 pages I counted over 100 color food photos.

Admittedly I don't really use it to create the full 30 minute meals but pick and choose bits from it. The fail-safe recipes have turned out to be excellent mid-week saviours and perfect for last minute dinner guests.Roll on a year and a half, and with a baby now in tow, time has become ever the more critical. There could be no more relevant book to land on my doorstep than Jamie's 15 Minute Meals because that's pretty much all I have to knock up a meal these days.For this latest book, courses or meals have generally been trimmed to two dishes maximum but this suits our mid-week eating better, we are not really a pudding household unless you count eating Nutella out of the jar! Flicking through, I could easily eat most of the food here. I like the relaxed yet often indulgent recipes and most would be a welcome break from the usual pasta and sauce, minestrone and risottos which form the bulk of our standard dinners.Photography-wise, this book is very on-brand with the Jamie empire; spalttered platters and creative mess which makes the food look all the more deliciously relaxed. The book itself seems to be less \"designed\" than past titles and relies heavily on the good food photography for interest. It's passable, but not as beautiful or well crafted and the typography (which really gives the last few of Jamie's books an edge design-wise) is bland and awkward in the introduction sections of this book, although clear and simple for the recipe layouts.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "9047584-jamie-s-30-minute-meals", "book_id": "9047584-jamie-s-30-minute-meals", "book_title": "Jamie's 30-Minute Meals", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3207401846", "review_id": "3207401846", "date": "Feb 25, 2020", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Wildgoose", "user_url": "/user/show/13838088-wildgoose", "text": "I love Jamie. He is a great person and a great cook. The reason for the 3 stars is simply cause the 30-minuets meals, do not take 30 minutes to make. Mostly cause if you are not that good in chopping veggies, it will definitely take time. Also some ingredients are hard to find in my country, so I have to look for substitutes. That does not mean that I do not love the book.I have seen here other reviews where they blame the chef and the book about the list of ingredients, but hey, I have news for you: The chef is British. He is making British cuisine. Of course some ingredients are not that common. You should have known that, before you bought the book.I knew it, so that factor does not affect my rating. Im just a bit sad that I cannot make the original recipe. The other reason for the 3 stars is the fact that most of the main dishes are pasta. I do understand the reason (full course in 30 minutes time), however I would like a bit more of variety.Overall I do recommend the book to busy ppl and persons who wish to make a quick friendly/family dinner with pretty nice recipes.Go ahead and see for yourselves.

This recipe book includes multiple sides, deserts and sometimes drinks.
