    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      As more of our time is spent in the digital world, streaming services and social networking apps have almost
      entirely
      replaced books. Despite the availability of e-readers such as Kindles, reading has become less and less common.
      One way
      this shift can be reversed is by giving people resources to find new books to read. The general area of interest
      for our
      project is the ratings and rankings of books, and how they compare to one another. We intend to address the
      comparison
      of popular books and allow book readers to get a sense of similarities and differences between books. This will
      potentially give them new books to read based on ones they have enjoyed in the past. We believe this visualization
      will
      address an important topic as reading improves one's focus, memory, empathy, and communication skills.â€¯ <strong>Be
